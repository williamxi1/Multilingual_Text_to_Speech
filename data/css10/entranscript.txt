p225_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p225_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p225_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p225_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p225_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p225_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p225_025.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p225_026.txt|How are you, sir ?
p225_027.txt|So is that it, then ?
p225_028.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p225_029.txt|What do we do ?
p225_030.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p225_033.txt|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p225_035.txt|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225_036.txt|It was a close call.
p225_037.txt|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p225_038.txt|Diving is no part of football.
p225_039.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p225_040.txt|You'd better believe it.
p225_044.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p225_045.txt|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225_046.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p225_049.txt|I have learned from him.
p225_051.txt|We are committed to the ban.
p225_052.txt|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225_053.txt|I have made that offer.
p225_054.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p225_056.txt|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225_057.txt|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225_058.txt|However, the problem is the timing.
p225_059.txt|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p225_060.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225_061.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225_062.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p225_063.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p225_064.txt|It could take some time.
p225_065.txt|There is no pressure on us.
p225_066.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p225_067.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p225_070.txt|That is bound to happen.
p225_071.txt|He is in the queue.
p225_072.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p225_073.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p225_081.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225_082.txt|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p225_083.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225_084.txt|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225_086.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p225_089.txt|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225_090.txt|I did not have a bet on myself.
p225_092.txt|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p225_094.txt|That's as it should be.
p225_103.txt|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225_104.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p225_108.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225_109.txt|That might help a bit.
p225_110.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225_111.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p225_113.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p225_114.txt|I told him I was a long time ago.
p225_115.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p225_116.txt|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225_117.txt|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225_118.txt|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p225_120.txt|The industry is not well organised.
p225_121.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p225_122.txt|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p225_123.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225_124.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p225_126.txt|The squad is too small.
p225_127.txt|It is a common problem.
p225_128.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225_131.txt|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p225_133.txt|I think he's the favourite.
p225_135.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225_136.txt|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p225_141.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225_142.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p225_143.txt|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225_144.txt|She will do for me.
p225_145.txt|Why change it ?
p225_147.txt|Does the name matter ?
p225_149.txt|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225_150.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225_151.txt|Nothing has been put into action.
p225_152.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p225_153.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p225_156.txt|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p225_157.txt|He was asked to quit.
p225_158.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p225_159.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p225_165.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225_166.txt|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225_169.txt|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p225_171.txt|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225_172.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p225_173.txt|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225_174.txt|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225_175.txt|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p225_176.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225_177.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p225_179.txt|They know no other way.
p225_182.txt|We are just glad to be alive.
p225_191.txt|People will ask about us.
p225_192.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p225_193.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225_195.txt|It is hard to tell.
p225_196.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p225_197.txt|Who was she ?
p225_199.txt|And they were being paid ?
p225_200.txt|It looked like a river.
p225_201.txt|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p225_202.txt|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
p225_203.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p225_208.txt|You are a great player.
p225_210.txt|Scotland will play its part.
p225_211.txt|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p225_212.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p225_218.txt|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p225_219.txt|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225_220.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p225_221.txt|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p225_222.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p225_223.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p225_224.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225_225.txt|It is good for our team.
p225_235.txt|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p225_236.txt|That will be the criteria for the future.
p225_237.txt|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p225_238.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p225_239.txt|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225_240.txt|We are in the hat.
p225_241.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p225_242.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225_243.txt|The irony was not lost.
p225_244.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p225_248.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225_254.txt|The problem was a social problem.
p225_257.txt|My son was too young to die.
p225_258.txt|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p225_264.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p225_265.txt|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p225_266.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225_268.txt|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p225_273.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p225_274.txt|We have not reached the point of no return.
p225_275.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p225_276.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225_277.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p225_279.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p225_280.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p225_281.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p225_282.txt|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p225_285.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p225_286.txt|I wanted to change the formula.
p225_287.txt|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225_289.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p225_290.txt|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p225_291.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p225_293.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p225_294.txt|However, we had no failures in our side.
p225_295.txt|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p225_296.txt|It goes back a long way.
p225_297.txt|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225_298.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p225_299.txt|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p225_300.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p225_301.txt|I must do something about it.
p225_302.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p225_303.txt|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p225_305.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p225_308.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p225_309.txt|Are they free ?
p225_310.txt|What are they for ?
p225_312.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p225_314.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p225_315.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p225_316.txt|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p225_317.txt|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p225_318.txt|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225_319.txt|There's still a bit to go.
p225_320.txt|We have a good healthy debate.
p225_322.txt|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p225_323.txt|It is a court case.
p225_324.txt|There is no plan B.
p225_325.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p225_326.txt|He will go a long way.
p225_328.txt|It is just a tax on employment.
p225_329.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p225_330.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p225_331.txt|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p225_332.txt|It's difficult to predict the future.
p225_334.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p225_335.txt|We are in the end game.
p225_336.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p225_337.txt|But they have the sound.
p225_346.txt|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p225_347.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p225_348.txt|Does it matter ?
p225_349.txt|How do you take them away ?
p225_350.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p225_351.txt|After the match, do you ?
p225_352.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p225_353.txt|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p225_354.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p225_355.txt|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p225_356.txt|I said he was set to retire.
p225_357.txt|It is a sign of hope.
p225_358.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p225_359.txt|But we welcome this document.
p225_363.txt|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p225_365.txt|You did not see it.
p225_366.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p226_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p226_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p226_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p226_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.

p226_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p226_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p226_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.

p226_025.txt|He has not been named.
p226_026.txt|That's no bad thing.
p226_027.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226_028.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226_029.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226_030.txt|Because we do not need it.
p226_031.txt|This is the window.
p226_032.txt|I was an athlete.
p226_033.txt|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226_036.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226_037.txt|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p226_039.txt|It has failed.
p226_040.txt|It was clear.
p226_041.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p226_042.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p226_043.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p226_044.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p226_045.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p226_046.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_047.txt|We need to chat.
p226_048.txt|It's a blessing.
p226_049.txt|But it might have done.
p226_050.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p226_051.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p226_052.txt|It is the whole package.
p226_053.txt|He had no enemies.
p226_054.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p226_055.txt|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_056.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p226_057.txt|It's the big omission.
p226_058.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p226_059.txt|She's a spy!
p226_060.txt|It is unique.
p226_061.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_062.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_063.txt|It's a real challenge.
p226_064.txt|It is not great art.
p226_065.txt|You do not change overnight.
p226_066.txt|Art is extra.
p226_067.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p226_068.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p226_069.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_070.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_071.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p226_072.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p226_073.txt|The script was funny.
p226_074.txt|You need a trademark.
p226_075.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p226_076.txt|Help is needed.
p226_077.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p226_078.txt|There could be a way back.
p226_079.txt|Neither it is.
p226_080.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p226_082.txt|It is a terrible place.
p226_083.txt|It works for us.
p226_084.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p226_085.txt|It can be halted.
p226_086.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p226_088.txt|Detection is often difficult.
p226_089.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226_090.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p226_091.txt|Someone who cares
p226_092.txt|It's just awful.
p226_093.txt|It's never too late.
p226_094.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p226_095.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p226_096.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p226_097.txt|We could not get any possession.
p226_098.txt|If you could find it.
p226_099.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p226_100.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226_101.txt|It was mayhem.
p226_102.txt|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226_103.txt|They were outside the circle.
p226_104.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p226_105.txt|May not have been at fault?
p226_106.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226_107.txt|It was a good performance.
p226_108.txt|That time is not now, however.
p226_109.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p226_110.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p226_111.txt|It was an adventure.
p226_112.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p226_113.txt|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_114.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p226_115.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p226_116.txt|It is normal.
p226_117.txt|I don't have many friends.
p226_118.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226_119.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p226_120.txt|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226_121.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p226_122.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226_124.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p226_125.txt|She's got to say something.
p226_126.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p226_127.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226_128.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p226_129.txt|She has been shot.
p226_130.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p226_131.txt|I was furious.
p226_132.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226_133.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p226_134.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226_135.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226_136.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p226_137.txt|It will be too hot.
p226_138.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226_139.txt|I am now unemployed.
p226_140.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p226_141.txt|Our intentions are real.
p226_142.txt|Government will intervene.
p226_143.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226_144.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226_145.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226_146.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226_148.txt|Three penalties were given.
p226_149.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p226_150.txt|We just had a go.
p226_151.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p226_152.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226_153.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p226_154.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226_155.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226_156.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p226_157.txt|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p226_158.txt|We will turn the corner.
p226_159.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p226_160.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p226_161.txt|These days are long gone.
p226_162.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p226_163.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p226_164.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226_165.txt|We have to move forward.
p226_166.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226_167.txt|They will do their own thing.
p226_168.txt|It is too much for me.
p226_169.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p226_171.txt|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p226_172.txt|It became a book by itself.
p226_173.txt|His team management was protective.
p226_174.txt|It's quite a routine.
p226_175.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p226_176.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p226_177.txt|I took the gun.
p226_178.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p226_179.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p226_180.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p226_181.txt|I've been there.
p226_183.txt|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226_184.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p226_185.txt|It is not fair.
p226_186.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p226_187.txt|I had a train to catch.
p226_188.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p226_189.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p226_190.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p226_191.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p226_192.txt|People will ask about us.
p226_193.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p226_194.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p226_195.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p226_197.txt|There was no option.
p226_198.txt|Is that it?
p226_199.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p226_200.txt|Is that success?
p226_201.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p226_202.txt|They are in the euro.
p226_203.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p226_204.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p226_205.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p226_206.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p226_207.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p226_208.txt|I don't want to use it.
p226_209.txt|Now, it's all right.
p226_210.txt|It's like a garage.
p226_211.txt|But I am a worried man.
p226_212.txt|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p226_213.txt|Feel the heat?
p226_214.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p226_215.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p226_216.txt|His third goal was superb.
p226_217.txt|It's not ideal.
p226_218.txt|I was so nervous.
p226_219.txt|I might come back.
p226_220.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p226_221.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p226_223.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p226_224.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p226_225.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p226_226.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p226_227.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p226_228.txt|I am immensely sad.
p226_229.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p226_230.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p226_231.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p226_232.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p226_233.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p226_234.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p226_235.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p226_236.txt|It is set in Paris.
p226_237.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p226_238.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p226_239.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p226_240.txt|She is well balanced.
p226_241.txt|They are all bright and different.
p226_242.txt|It's only fair.
p226_243.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p226_244.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_245.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p226_246.txt|His body was never found.
p226_247.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p226_248.txt|I was shocked.
p226_249.txt|I should think so, too.
p226_251.txt|There's the mix.
p226_252.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p226_253.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p226_254.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p226_255.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p226_256.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p226_257.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p226_258.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p226_259.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p226_260.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p226_261.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p226_262.txt|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p226_263.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p226_264.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p226_265.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p226_266.txt|The warning is timely.
p226_267.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p226_268.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p226_269.txt|They are never here.
p226_270.txt|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p226_271.txt|He was popular.
p226_272.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p226_273.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p226_274.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226_276.txt|It's a way of life.
p226_278.txt|I feel pretty good.
p226_279.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p226_280.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p226_281.txt|It happens from time to time.
p226_283.txt|He looked very sharp.
p226_284.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p226_285.txt|It was a virus.
p226_286.txt|Yet, it worked.
p226_287.txt|Who will perform?
p226_288.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p226_289.txt|This is a national crisis.
p226_290.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p226_291.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p226_292.txt|It goes back a long way.
p226_293.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p226_294.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p226_295.txt|He should have won.
p226_296.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p226_297.txt|There's a pause.
p226_298.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p226_299.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p226_300.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p226_301.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p226_302.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p226_303.txt|One was a lawyer.
p226_304.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p226_305.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p226_306.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p226_307.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p226_308.txt|This is a war over our home.
p226_309.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226_310.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p226_311.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p226_312.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p226_313.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p226_314.txt|I did not name it.
p226_315.txt|It was a question of patience.
p226_316.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p226_317.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p226_318.txt|Kids are terrible.
p226_319.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p226_320.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p226_321.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p226_322.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p226_323.txt|He said she was mad.
p226_324.txt|We are in the end game.
p226_325.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p226_326.txt|The airport was even different.
p226_327.txt|We do the same.
p226_328.txt|That's the law of the land.
p226_329.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p226_330.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p226_331.txt|Donald was his friend.
p226_332.txt|I am so upset.
p226_333.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p226_334.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p226_335.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p226_336.txt|It is a time bomb.
p226_337.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p226_338.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p226_339.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p226_340.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226_341.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226_342.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p226_343.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226_344.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p226_345.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p226_346.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p226_347.txt|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226_348.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p226_349.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p226_350.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p226_351.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226_352.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p226_353.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p226_354.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p226_355.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p226_356.txt|She is free.
p226_357.txt|I kept going for her.
p226_358.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p226_359.txt|He's very explosive.
p226_360.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p226_361.txt|Our numbers are small.
p226_362.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p226_363.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p226_364.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p226_365.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p226_366.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p226_367.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p226_368.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p226_369.txt|He took over our lives.
p226_370.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p227_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p227_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p227_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p227_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p227_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p227_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p227_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p227_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p227_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p227_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p227_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p227_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p227_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p227_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p227_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p227_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p227_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p227_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p227_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p227_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p227_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p227_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p227_025.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p227_026.txt|Movement has to take place.
p227_027.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p227_028.txt|We will look into it.
p227_029.txt|This is a central issue.
p227_030.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p227_031.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p227_032.txt|There, you were just a body.
p227_033.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p227_034.txt|President Bush is at war.
p227_035.txt|I became a widow overnight.
p227_036.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p227_037.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p227_038.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p227_039.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p227_040.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227_041.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p227_042.txt|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p227_043.txt|I'd come back from London.
p227_044.txt|If I was a woman.
p227_045.txt|He was a home referee.
p227_046.txt|There was no safety net.
p227_047.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_048.txt|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_049.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p227_050.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p227_051.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_052.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p227_053.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p227_054.txt|I could not do it.
p227_055.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p227_056.txt|How are you, sir ?
p227_057.txt|So is that it, then ?
p227_058.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p227_059.txt|What do we do ?
p227_060.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_061.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p227_062.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p227_063.txt|We will pay their bills.
p227_064.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_065.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p227_066.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_067.txt|I have proved that in the past.
p227_068.txt|He had been a singer.
p227_069.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_070.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p227_071.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_072.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_073.txt|It is a terrible place.
p227_074.txt|Even the one she loved.
p227_075.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_076.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p227_077.txt|I first met him last summer.
p227_078.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p227_079.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227_080.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p227_081.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p227_082.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p227_083.txt|They lived for their children.
p227_084.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p227_085.txt|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p227_086.txt|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227_087.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p227_088.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p227_089.txt|You might not make it.
p227_090.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p227_091.txt|That is the important thing.
p227_092.txt|For once, you should believe the hype.
p227_093.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p227_094.txt|Their attitude is all wrong.
p227_095.txt|You are like an animal.
p227_096.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p227_097.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p227_098.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227_099.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p227_100.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p227_101.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227_102.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p227_103.txt|It was never a starter.
p227_104.txt|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227_105.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p227_106.txt|It is safe in our hands.
p227_107.txt|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p227_108.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p227_109.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p227_110.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p227_111.txt|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_112.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p227_113.txt|However, we have to be cautious.
p227_114.txt|But we could only help a handful of people.
p227_116.txt|It is just a tax on employment.
p227_117.txt|This should begin in October.
p227_118.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p227_119.txt|We did what we had to do.
p227_120.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p227_121.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p227_122.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p227_123.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p227_124.txt|And does it ?
p227_125.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p227_126.txt|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_127.txt|Any success would have been an improvement.
p227_128.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227_129.txt|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p227_130.txt|He is a great addition to our team.
p227_131.txt|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227_132.txt|I felt he was excellent.
p227_133.txt|They could use a boost.
p227_134.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p227_135.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p227_136.txt|This is a limited market.
p227_137.txt|Our position is quite simple.
p227_138.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p227_139.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227_140.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_141.txt|He's not a Celtic man.
p227_142.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p227_143.txt|So I got a blood test.
p227_144.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p227_145.txt|These men are a part of India.
p227_146.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p227_147.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p227_148.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p227_149.txt|That was the difference between the sides.
p227_150.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p227_151.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p227_152.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p227_153.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p227_154.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227_155.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p227_156.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p227_157.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p227_158.txt|It is difficult to say.
p227_159.txt|He was in great spirits.
p227_160.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p227_161.txt|They want to see him.
p227_162.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p227_163.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p227_164.txt|There is no signature on this document.
p227_165.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p227_166.txt|What happened in that game ?
p227_167.txt|Are you going to win ?
p227_168.txt|Was it the wife ?
p227_169.txt|Why change it ?
p227_170.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p227_171.txt|The people are the hero.
p227_172.txt|One season, they might do well.
p227_173.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p227_174.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227_175.txt|The jury is still out.
p227_176.txt|But he has a lifeline.
p227_177.txt|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227_178.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p227_179.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p227_180.txt|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_181.txt|I think it's a good sign.
p227_183.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p227_184.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p227_186.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p227_187.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p227_188.txt|We've just had it confirmed.
p227_189.txt|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_190.txt|This is the time to use it.
p227_191.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p227_192.txt|They were seriously after him.
p227_193.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227_194.txt|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227_195.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p227_196.txt|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p227_197.txt|The force is with them.
p227_198.txt|If the director is with you.
p227_199.txt|He made no order on costs.
p227_200.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p227_201.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227_203.txt|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227_204.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p227_205.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p227_206.txt|My heart is with the artist.
p227_207.txt|That might mean another delay.
p227_208.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p227_209.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227_210.txt|This is a holy place.
p227_211.txt|Does the name matter ?
p227_212.txt|how do you get it back ?
p227_213.txt|What are you not good at ?
p227_214.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p227_215.txt|Who was she ?
p227_216.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p227_217.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227_218.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_219.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p227_220.txt|There is no quick fix.
p227_222.txt|They have known the hard times.
p227_223.txt|That might help a bit.
p227_226.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p227_227.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p227_228.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p227_229.txt|It's just a normal life.
p227_230.txt|He must get to know himself.
p227_231.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p227_232.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p227_233.txt|The fight is under way.
p227_235.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p227_236.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p227_237.txt|We can certainly build on this.
p227_238.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p227_239.txt|There is a world of difference.
p227_240.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p227_241.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p227_242.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p227_243.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p227_244.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p227_245.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p227_246.txt|She died in middle age.
p227_247.txt|It is set in Paris.
p227_248.txt|You will have seen the adverts.
p227_249.txt|It is possible to be too good.
p227_250.txt|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227_251.txt|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_252.txt|The irony was not lost.
p227_253.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p227_254.txt|It is a court case.
p227_255.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p227_256.txt|She took them for a term.
p227_257.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227_258.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p227_259.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p227_260.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227_261.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p227_262.txt|Our decision making was poor.
p227_263.txt|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p227_264.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p227_265.txt|And they were being paid ?
p227_266.txt|Was everything done to save people ?
p227_267.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p227_268.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p227_269.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p227_270.txt|Did he trip ?
p227_271.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227_272.txt|I should think so, too.
p227_273.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p227_274.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p227_275.txt|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p227_276.txt|I told you I was ill.
p227_277.txt|I can't get a job.
p227_278.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p227_279.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_280.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p227_281.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227_282.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p227_283.txt|Every one is a winner.
p227_284.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p227_285.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227_286.txt|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227_287.txt|They can leave at any time.
p227_288.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p227_289.txt|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p227_290.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227_291.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p227_292.txt|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227_293.txt|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227_294.txt|But the plot is not the point.
p227_295.txt|It was never a free kick.
p227_296.txt|My body is a wreck.
p227_297.txt|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p227_298.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p227_299.txt|She failed in her action.
p227_300.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p227_301.txt|It's hard to see it.
p227_302.txt|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227_303.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p227_304.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p227_305.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227_306.txt|It is an amazing response.
p227_307.txt|Size is not the issue.
p227_308.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p227_309.txt|We have the easy part.
p227_310.txt|We are not increasing the number.
p227_311.txt|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227_312.txt|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_313.txt|It could well be military.
p227_314.txt|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227_315.txt|His job was not advertised.
p227_316.txt|This is a big step up.
p227_317.txt|It goes back a long way.
p227_318.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p227_319.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p227_320.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p227_321.txt|I have got a victim.
p227_322.txt|The judge was really nice.
p227_323.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p227_324.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p227_326.txt|The dealer is on notice.
p227_327.txt|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_328.txt|The party lasted all night.
p227_329.txt|He would help me with the form.
p227_330.txt|There's still a bit to go.
p227_331.txt|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227_332.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p227_333.txt|It is so easy to be negative.
p227_334.txt|What form did that take ?
p227_335.txt|Are they free ?
p227_336.txt|What are they for ?
p227_337.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p227_338.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339.txt|So what happens next ?
p227_340.txt|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227_341.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p227_342.txt|Have a look at this lot.
p227_343.txt|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_344.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227_345.txt|The king is delighted by the honour.
p227_347.txt|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227_348.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p227_349.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p227_350.txt|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227_351.txt|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_352.txt|There was no time scale.
p227_353.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p227_354.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p227_355.txt|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p227_356.txt|They were the acts of men.
p227_357.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227_358.txt|Of course, we want to go home.
p227_359.txt|I am very interested in the subject.
p227_360.txt|He is not very big, either.
p227_361.txt|A report is expected next month.
p227_363.txt|We are encouraged by the news.
p227_364.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p227_365.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p227_366.txt|Is it worth it ?
p227_367.txt|Does it matter ?
p227_368.txt|A crucial moment has arrived.
p227_369.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p227_370.txt|We need to be prepared.
p227_371.txt|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_372.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p227_373.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227_374.txt|It has been made to entertain.
p227_375.txt|It is a stroke of genius.
p227_376.txt|Italy was just behind the US.
p227_377.txt|It was forced to divert.
p227_378.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p227_379.txt|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227_380.txt|We are still getting over it.
p227_382.txt|This will impact on us.
p227_383.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p227_384.txt|He is in the queue.
p227_385.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p227_386.txt|I do not like to lose.
p227_387.txt|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227_388.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p227_389.txt|In due course the deal was done.
p227_390.txt|Celtic were pleased to help.
p227_391.txt|They will fight for everything.
p227_392.txt|That's not like us at all.
p227_393.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p227_394.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227_395.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p227_396.txt|It is a terrible equation.
p227_397.txt|They have not got anyone.
p227_398.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p227_399.txt|How do you take them away ?
p227_400.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p227_401.txt|After the match, do you ?
p227_402.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p228_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p228_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p228_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p228_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p228_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p228_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p228_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p228_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p228_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p228_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p228_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p228_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p228_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p228_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p228_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p228_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p228_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p228_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p228_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p228_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p228_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p228_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p228_025.txt|It's nice to hear.
p228_026.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p228_027.txt|Because we do not need it.
p228_028.txt|There's a story, too.
p228_029.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p228_030.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p228_031.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p228_032.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p228_033.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p228_034.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p228_035.txt|It was clear.
p228_036.txt|The problem is the pitch.
p228_037.txt|Indeed, he does.
p228_038.txt|President Bush is at war.
p228_039.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p228_040.txt|My whole life has changed.
p228_041.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p228_042.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p228_043.txt|It is urgent.
p228_044.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p228_045.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228_046.txt|We need to chat.
p228_047.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228_048.txt|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228_049.txt|But it might have done.
p228_050.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p228_051.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p228_052.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p228_053.txt|Here's a clue.
p228_054.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p228_055.txt|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228_056.txt|That's the day job.
p228_057.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p228_058.txt|That's the truth.
p228_059.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p228_060.txt|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228_061.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p228_062.txt|They're appalled by that.
p228_063.txt|There was a battle there.
p228_064.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p228_065.txt|It's that kind of place.
p228_066.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p228_067.txt|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228_068.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p228_070.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p228_071.txt|The script was funny.
p228_072.txt|Try to save us.
p228_073.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
p228_074.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p228_075.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p228_076.txt|It's all I can do.
p228_077.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p228_078.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p228_079.txt|I had my suspicions.
p228_081.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p228_082.txt|Today she has been released.
p228_083.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p228_084.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p228_085.txt|But she might be.
p228_086.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p228_087.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p228_088.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p228_089.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p228_090.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p228_091.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p228_092.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p228_093.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p228_094.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p228_095.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p228_096.txt|It is an old family habit.
p228_097.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p228_098.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p228_099.txt|It is annoying.
p228_100.txt|We could not get any possession.
p228_101.txt|I love the Dome.
p228_102.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p228_103.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p228_104.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p228_105.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p228_106.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p228_107.txt|It is a good day for the coalition.
p228_108.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p228_109.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p228_110.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p228_111.txt|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p228_112.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p228_113.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p228_114.txt|They will want to perform well.
p228_115.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p228_116.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p228_117.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p228_118.txt|Further protests are likely.
p228_119.txt|It's in his blood.
p228_120.txt|I don't want to use the term.
p228_121.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p228_122.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228_123.txt|It is so sad.
p228_124.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p228_125.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p228_126.txt|Who would be a referee ?
p228_127.txt|They've got to account for it.
p228_128.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p228_129.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p228_130.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p228_131.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p228_132.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p228_133.txt|This plan is an agenda for action.
p228_134.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p228_135.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p228_136.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p228_137.txt|Who will attend ?
p228_138.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p228_139.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p228_140.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p228_141.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p228_142.txt|He was in a great deal of pain.
p228_143.txt|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p228_144.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p228_145.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p228_146.txt|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p228_147.txt|Who would be right ?
p228_148.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p228_149.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p228_150.txt|Had she enjoyed the experience ?
p228_151.txt|That should do it.
p228_152.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p228_153.txt|It is not just about pay.
p228_154.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p228_155.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p228_156.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p228_157.txt|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p228_158.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p228_159.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p228_160.txt|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p228_161.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228_162.txt|It was by the numbers.
p228_163.txt|I was in daily contact.
p228_164.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p228_165.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p228_166.txt|It was so new, so exciting.
p228_167.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p228_168.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p228_169.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p228_170.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p228_171.txt|We have to move forward.
p228_172.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p228_173.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p228_174.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p228_175.txt|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p228_176.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p228_177.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p228_178.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p228_179.txt|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p228_180.txt|One season, they might do well.
p228_181.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p228_182.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p228_183.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p228_184.txt|I drove the ball well.
p228_185.txt|I took the gun.
p228_186.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p228_187.txt|They will run a mile.
p228_188.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p228_189.txt|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p228_190.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p228_191.txt|I put the drawing down.
p228_192.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p228_193.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p228_194.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p228_195.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p228_196.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p228_197.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p228_198.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p228_199.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228_200.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p228_202.txt|It's the same old story.
p228_203.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p228_204.txt|Is that success ?
p228_205.txt|I have a cold.
p228_206.txt|They are in the euro.
p228_207.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p228_208.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p228_209.txt|Who will pay for this ?
p228_210.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p228_211.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p228_212.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p228_213.txt|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p228_214.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p228_215.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p228_216.txt|That will be vital.
p228_217.txt|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p228_218.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p228_219.txt|She should not be blamed.
p228_220.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p228_221.txt|His third goal was superb.
p228_222.txt|It's been a good year.
p228_223.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p228_224.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p228_225.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p228_226.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p228_227.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p228_228.txt|It is a gamble.
p228_229.txt|It's so special.
p228_230.txt|You take a risk.
p228_231.txt|He is severe.
p228_232.txt|We just had a go.
p228_233.txt|We are in the hat.
p228_234.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p228_235.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p228_236.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p228_237.txt|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p228_238.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p228_239.txt|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228_240.txt|She was well balanced.
p228_241.txt|It's only fair.
p228_242.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p228_243.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p228_244.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p228_245.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p228_246.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p228_247.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p228_248.txt|It was a hit.
p228_249.txt|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p228_250.txt|I can't get a job.
p228_251.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p228_252.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228_253.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p228_254.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p228_255.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p228_256.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p228_257.txt|Is that a serious question ?
p228_258.txt|They are real.
p228_259.txt|They must play for each other.
p228_260.txt|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p228_261.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p228_262.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p228_263.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p228_264.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p228_265.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p228_266.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p228_267.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p228_268.txt|I was rubbish.
p228_269.txt|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p228_270.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p228_271.txt|It's a way of life.
p228_272.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p228_274.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p228_275.txt|They were too hard.
p228_276.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p228_277.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p228_278.txt|All options are open.
p228_279.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p228_280.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p228_281.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p228_282.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p228_283.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p228_284.txt|It changed my life.
p228_285.txt|The songs are just so good.
p228_286.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p228_287.txt|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p228_288.txt|It became a book by itself.
p228_289.txt|The home was now under new management.
p228_290.txt|Graeme was prepared.
p228_291.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p228_292.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p228_293.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p228_294.txt|They are wrong.
p228_295.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p228_296.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p228_297.txt|You are the glory.
p228_298.txt|It's certainly different.
p228_299.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p228_300.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p228_301.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p228_302.txt|Is there on his hands ?
p228_303.txt|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228_304.txt|It's not even finished.
p228_305.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p228_306.txt|Kids are terrible.
p228_307.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p228_308.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p228_309.txt|He said she was mad.
p228_310.txt|There was some merit in that.
p228_311.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p228_312.txt|We do the same.
p228_313.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p228_315.txt|It's not long enough.
p228_316.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p228_317.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p228_318.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p228_319.txt|Is that an issue ?
p228_320.txt|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p228_321.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p228_322.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p228_323.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p228_324.txt|There was no option.
p228_325.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p228_326.txt|It is a sign of hope.
p228_327.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p228_328.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p228_329.txt|The train was on time.
p228_330.txt|It is so unfair.
p228_331.txt|He has to learn.
p228_332.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p228_333.txt|I've got no secret.
p228_334.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p228_335.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p228_336.txt|It was forced to divert.
p228_337.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p228_338.txt|This is a friendly match ?
p228_339.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p228_340.txt|He's a genius.
p228_341.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p228_342.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p228_343.txt|It's the last thing on my mind.
p228_344.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p228_345.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p228_346.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p228_347.txt|She is free.
p228_348.txt|Everyone was in tears.
p228_349.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p228_350.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p228_351.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p228_352.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p228_353.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p228_354.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p228_355.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p228_356.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p228_357.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p228_358.txt|The play is based on a real-life event.
p228_359.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p228_360.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p228_361.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p228_362.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p228_363.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p228_364.txt|It is a simple equation.
p228_365.txt|So there, we won.
p228_366.txt|But I managed.
p228_367.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p228_368.txt|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228_369.txt|There is no signature.
p228_370.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p228_371.txt|It became a national network.
p229_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p229_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p229_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p229_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p229_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p229_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p229_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p229_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p229_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p229_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p229_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p229_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p229_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p229_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p229_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p229_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p229_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p229_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p229_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p229_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p229_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p229_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p229_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p229_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p229_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p229_026.txt|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p229_027.txt|It's nice to hear.
p229_028.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p229_029.txt|I have a theory.
p229_030.txt|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p229_031.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p229_032.txt|Because we do not need it.
p229_033.txt|And we have a singer.
p229_034.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p229_035.txt|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p229_036.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p229_037.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_038.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p229_039.txt|They're just different.
p229_040.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p229_041.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p229_042.txt|He did not know his daughter.
p229_043.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p229_044.txt|I was scared.
p229_045.txt|It will come all right.
p229_046.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p229_047.txt|But it is all by design.
p229_048.txt|I am just going to go for it.
p229_050.txt|We need to chat.
p229_051.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p229_052.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p229_053.txt|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p229_054.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p229_055.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p229_056.txt|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p229_057.txt|She's a spy !
p229_058.txt|What was the main difference ?
p229_059.txt|My mother is a widow.
p229_060.txt|And a film maker was born.
p229_061.txt|Art is extra.
p229_062.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p229_063.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229_064.txt|We should have known.
p229_065.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p229_066.txt|Try to save us.
p229_067.txt|That was the easy election.
p229_068.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p229_069.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p229_070.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229_071.txt|Neither it is.
p229_072.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p229_073.txt|It was chaotic.
p229_074.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p229_075.txt|It works for us.
p229_076.txt|I've not thought about it.
p229_077.txt|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229_078.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p229_079.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p229_080.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229_081.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p229_082.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p229_083.txt|Someone who cares
p229_084.txt|He can do everything.
p229_085.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p229_086.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p229_087.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p229_088.txt|They lived for their children.
p229_089.txt|It is a lifeline.
p229_090.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p229_091.txt|We must look forward.
p229_092.txt|It is an old family habit.
p229_093.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p229_094.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p229_095.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p229_096.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p229_097.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p229_098.txt|She's got to say something.
p229_099.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p229_100.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p229_101.txt|She has so much to offer.
p229_102.txt|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p229_103.txt|It is a good day for the coalition.
p229_104.txt|We work on the same level.
p229_105.txt|They were outside the circle.
p229_106.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p229_108.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p229_109.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p229_110.txt|I'm not depressed.
p229_111.txt|It is normal.
p229_112.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p229_113.txt|I don't have many friends.
p229_114.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p229_115.txt|I came to complete.
p229_116.txt|I was angry.
p229_117.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p229_118.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p229_119.txt|It's not fair.
p229_120.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p229_121.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p229_122.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p229_123.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p229_124.txt|I joined a group.
p229_125.txt|It is rubbish.
p229_126.txt|Who would be a referee ?
p229_127.txt|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
p229_128.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p229_129.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229_130.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p229_131.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p229_132.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p229_133.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p229_134.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p229_135.txt|It's an amazing landscape !
p229_136.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p229_137.txt|He is slightly confused.
p229_138.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p229_139.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p229_140.txt|They took a risk.
p229_141.txt|Government will intervene.
p229_142.txt|What will happen then ?
p229_143.txt|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p229_144.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p229_145.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p229_146.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p229_147.txt|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p229_148.txt|Three penalties were given.
p229_149.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p229_150.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p229_151.txt|Who would be right ?
p229_152.txt|We just had a go.
p229_153.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p229_154.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p229_155.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p229_156.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229_157.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p229_158.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p229_159.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p229_160.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p229_161.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p229_162.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p229_163.txt|It was by the numbers.
p229_164.txt|I knew he was good.
p229_165.txt|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p229_166.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p229_167.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p229_168.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p229_169.txt|Was this element always there ?
p229_170.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p229_171.txt|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p229_172.txt|I will tell you.
p229_173.txt|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p229_174.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p229_175.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p229_176.txt|We have to move forward.
p229_177.txt|It's that sort of night.
p229_178.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p229_179.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p229_180.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p229_181.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p229_182.txt|It is a memorial.
p229_183.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p229_184.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p229_185.txt|One season, they might do well.
p229_186.txt|Is Saddam a threat ?
p229_187.txt|The home was now under new management.
p229_188.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p229_189.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p229_190.txt|I drove the ball well.
p229_191.txt|It is the whole package.
p229_192.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p229_193.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p229_194.txt|It is minute.
p229_195.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p229_196.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p229_197.txt|What has caused the demise of singing ?
p229_198.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p229_199.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p229_200.txt|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p229_201.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p229_202.txt|People will ask about us.
p229_203.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229_204.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p229_205.txt|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p229_206.txt|It wasn't to be.
p229_207.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p229_209.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p229_210.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229_211.txt|It's the same old story.
p229_212.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p229_213.txt|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229_214.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229_215.txt|The procedures were not in place.
p229_216.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p229_217.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p229_218.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p229_219.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p229_220.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p229_221.txt|She should not be blamed.
p229_222.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p229_223.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p229_224.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p229_225.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p229_226.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p229_227.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p229_228.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p229_229.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p229_230.txt|Who was on the panel ?
p229_231.txt|We've got the bronze.
p229_232.txt|Saturday is gone.
p229_233.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p229_234.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p229_235.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p229_236.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p229_237.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p229_238.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p229_239.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p229_240.txt|We are so proud.
p229_241.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p229_242.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p229_243.txt|It's an idea.
p229_244.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p229_245.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p229_246.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p229_247.txt|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p229_248.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p229_249.txt|The letters are going out today.
p229_250.txt|It's only fair.
p229_251.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p229_252.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p229_253.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p229_254.txt|It was a hit.
p229_255.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p229_256.txt|This year I understood.
p229_257.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p229_258.txt|Kirkwood was arrested.
p229_259.txt|This is a big club.
p229_260.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p229_261.txt|I was happily surprised.
p229_262.txt|They must play for each other.
p229_263.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p229_264.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p229_265.txt|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p229_266.txt|That is highly unfair.
p229_267.txt|The warning is timely.
p229_268.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p229_269.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p229_270.txt|They are never here.
p229_271.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p229_272.txt|He was also married with two children.
p229_273.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p229_274.txt|We're in shock.
p229_275.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p229_277.txt|It's a way of life.
p229_278.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p229_279.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p229_280.txt|I am an estate agent.
p229_281.txt|People have no choice.
p229_282.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p229_283.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p229_284.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p229_285.txt|If not, he should go home.
p229_286.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p229_287.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p229_288.txt|I felt like I was a child.
p229_289.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
p229_290.txt|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p229_292.txt|We have other options.
p229_293.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229_294.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p229_295.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p229_296.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p229_297.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p229_298.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p229_300.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p229_301.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p229_302.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p229_303.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p229_304.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p229_305.txt|There is no openness.
p229_306.txt|This is a war over our home.
p229_307.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p229_308.txt|It's just not funny !
p229_309.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p229_310.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p229_311.txt|You are the glory.
p229_312.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p229_313.txt|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p229_314.txt|It's certainly different.
p229_315.txt|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p229_316.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p229_318.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p229_319.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p229_320.txt|It's not even finished.
p229_322.txt|It should be equal.
p229_323.txt|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p229_324.txt|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p229_325.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p229_326.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p229_328.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p229_329.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p229_330.txt|It could have gone either way.
p229_331.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p229_332.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p229_333.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p229_334.txt|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p229_335.txt|He told the court.
p229_336.txt|The team for the first game could be this one.
p229_337.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p229_338.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p229_339.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p229_340.txt|He did a good job.
p229_341.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p229_342.txt|Today she has been released.
p229_343.txt|These days are long gone.
p229_344.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p229_345.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p229_346.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p229_347.txt|I've got no secret.
p229_348.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p229_349.txt|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p229_350.txt|I'm very lucky.
p229_351.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p229_352.txt|Everything was an effort.
p229_353.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p229_354.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p229_355.txt|It is long gone.
p229_356.txt|It's the last thing on my mind.
p229_357.txt|Tell us about it.
p229_358.txt|There is a cup final at stake.
p229_359.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p229_360.txt|It was very formal.
p229_361.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p229_362.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p229_363.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p229_364.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p229_365.txt|We are looking for perfection.
p229_366.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p229_367.txt|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p229_368.txt|I am a star.
p229_369.txt|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p229_370.txt|He could make it.
p229_371.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p229_373.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p229_374.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p229_376.txt|It is a simple equation.
p229_377.txt|Talks are progressing.
p229_378.txt|They play together perfectly.
p229_379.txt|It's a long process.
p229_380.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p229_381.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p229_382.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p229_384.txt|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p229_386.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p229_387.txt|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p229_388.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p229_389.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p229_390.txt|There were no casualties.
p229_391.txt|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p229_392.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p230_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p230_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p230_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p230_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p230_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p230_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p230_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p230_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p230_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p230_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p230_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p230_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p230_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p230_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p230_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p230_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p230_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p230_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p230_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p230_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p230_025.txt|It is on the internet.
p230_026.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p230_027.txt|He has the courage of the unaware.
p230_028.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p230_029.txt|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p230_030.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p230_031.txt|I'm so happy that she did.
p230_032.txt|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
p230_033.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p230_034.txt|He really is a lovely man.
p230_035.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p230_036.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p230_037.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p230_038.txt|They said she was stable.
p230_039.txt|This will save interest charges.
p230_040.txt|Well, he is an artist.
p230_041.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p230_042.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p230_043.txt|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p230_044.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p230_045.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p230_046.txt|If not, he should go home.
p230_047.txt|I must take a seat.
p230_048.txt|It was bound to happen.
p230_049.txt|We have to bring in new players.
p230_050.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p230_051.txt|I have made that offer.
p230_052.txt|None has ever been found.
p230_053.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p230_054.txt|We should be able to cope.
p230_055.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p230_056.txt|We will pay their bills.
p230_057.txt|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p230_058.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p230_059.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p230_060.txt|It's not covered by the insurance.
p230_061.txt|But the challenge is in the US.
p230_062.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p230_063.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p230_064.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230_065.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p230_066.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p230_068.txt|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230_069.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p230_070.txt|It looks like a hit.
p230_071.txt|What do we do ?
p230_072.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p230_073.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p230_074.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230_075.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230_076.txt|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230_077.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p230_078.txt|This is a true story.
p230_079.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p230_080.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p230_081.txt|They lived for their children.
p230_083.txt|It might change your life.
p230_084.txt|You are a great player.
p230_085.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p230_086.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p230_087.txt|It was not an insult.
p230_088.txt|You might not make it.
p230_089.txt|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p230_090.txt|I did not have a bet on myself.
p230_091.txt|The conclusion is the same.
p230_092.txt|He was prepared for this.
p230_093.txt|But I know the course.
p230_094.txt|You are like an animal.
p230_095.txt|We intend to change the model.
p230_096.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p230_097.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p230_099.txt|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p230_100.txt|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p230_101.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p230_102.txt|This was a good move for me.
p230_103.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p230_104.txt|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p230_105.txt|It is close to call.
p230_106.txt|It is an impressive record.
p230_107.txt|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p230_108.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p230_109.txt|Abbey National is an option.
p230_110.txt|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
p230_112.txt|We have the mental strength.
p230_113.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p230_114.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p230_115.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p230_116.txt|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p230_117.txt|Which can happen any time.
p230_118.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p230_119.txt|But this time we can have no excuses.
p230_120.txt|They are very happy with the new settlement.
p230_121.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p230_122.txt|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p230_123.txt|We did what we had to do.
p230_124.txt|She was also very brave.
p230_125.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p230_126.txt|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p230_127.txt|The opposite is the case.
p230_128.txt|He was a home referee.
p230_129.txt|This is a successful outcome.
p230_130.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p230_131.txt|She died at her home.
p230_132.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p230_133.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p230_134.txt|It was a piece of art.
p230_135.txt|I would relish the prospect.
p230_137.txt|These men are a part of India.
p230_138.txt|I was caught out a little bit.
p230_139.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p230_140.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p230_141.txt|It has to be an event.
p230_142.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p230_143.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p230_144.txt|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230_145.txt|She has gone to the Catholic school.
p230_146.txt|It was by the numbers.
p230_147.txt|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
p230_148.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p230_149.txt|However, he was later released without charge.
p230_150.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p230_151.txt|These days are long gone.
p230_152.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p230_153.txt|We are still getting over it.
p230_154.txt|It has to be now.
p230_155.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p230_156.txt|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p230_157.txt|They will do their own thing.
p230_158.txt|You had to go and see him.
p230_159.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p230_160.txt|And does it ?
p230_161.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p230_162.txt|Had I heard ?
p230_163.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p230_164.txt|Our position remains the same.
p230_165.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p230_166.txt|We believe in the medium term.
p230_167.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p230_168.txt|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p230_169.txt|On the month the weakness was across the board.
p230_170.txt|One season, they might do well.
p230_171.txt|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p230_172.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p230_173.txt|But he has a lifeline.
p230_174.txt|Phase one was a shambles.
p230_175.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p230_176.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p230_177.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p230_178.txt|Tomorrow is a new day.
p230_179.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p230_180.txt|She has left the island.
p230_181.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p230_182.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p230_183.txt|They will run a mile.
p230_184.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p230_185.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p230_186.txt|He prefers to play for them.
p230_188.txt|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p230_189.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p230_190.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p230_191.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p230_192.txt|We always felt we could win.
p230_194.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p230_195.txt|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p230_196.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p230_198.txt|I made a terrible start.
p230_199.txt|The result is called a patent.
p230_200.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p230_201.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p230_202.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p230_203.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p230_204.txt|This is a holy place.
p230_205.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p230_206.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p230_207.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p230_208.txt|This will take several weeks.
p230_209.txt|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p230_210.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p230_211.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p230_212.txt|There is no quick fix.
p230_213.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p230_214.txt|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p230_215.txt|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230_216.txt|He has made his base in Spain.
p230_217.txt|My life is in the ballet.
p230_218.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p230_219.txt|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p230_220.txt|His second was a beauty.
p230_221.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p230_222.txt|Does the name matter ?
p230_223.txt|How do you get it back ?
p230_224.txt|What are you not good at ?
p230_225.txt|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p230_226.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p230_227.txt|It was a day for records.
p230_228.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p230_230.txt|That has been the easy part.
p230_231.txt|Things were so intense in the studio.
p230_232.txt|I was not sure whether I had won.
p230_233.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p230_234.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p230_235.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p230_236.txt|It had so much to do with output.
p230_237.txt|Must have been at the bar.
p230_238.txt|She died in middle age.
p230_239.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p230_240.txt|They need to win a trophy.
p230_241.txt|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230_242.txt|It is possible to be too good.
p230_243.txt|In many ways, that is as important.
p230_244.txt|Here is a question for you.
p230_245.txt|I was just a kid.
p230_246.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p230_247.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p230_248.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p230_249.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p230_250.txt|We have to compete at our own level.
p230_251.txt|They showed a lot of heart.
p230_252.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p230_253.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p230_254.txt|She took them for a term.
p230_255.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p230_257.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p230_258.txt|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p230_259.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p230_260.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p230_261.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p230_262.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p230_263.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p230_264.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p230_265.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p230_266.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p230_267.txt|I should think so, too.
p230_268.txt|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p230_269.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230_270.txt|I was ready for this.
p230_271.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p230_272.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p230_273.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p230_274.txt|We feel very good about it.
p230_276.txt|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p230_277.txt|It is also very valuable.
p230_278.txt|None of this work is guaranteed.
p230_279.txt|There is a case to answer.
p230_280.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p230_281.txt|They can leave at any time.
p230_282.txt|And they were being paid ?
p230_283.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p230_284.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p230_285.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p230_286.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p230_287.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p230_288.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p230_289.txt|In that moment, I was happy.
p230_290.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p230_291.txt|It was never a free kick.
p230_292.txt|It is a recipe for success.
p230_293.txt|I would rather look at him.
p230_295.txt|It's got to come from me.
p230_296.txt|It took a month and a half to film.
p230_297.txt|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p230_298.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p230_299.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p230_300.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p230_302.txt|He is at war with his knee.
p230_303.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230_304.txt|I was there five months ago.
p230_305.txt|You have to see it like this.
p230_306.txt|Rugby is now just like football.
p230_307.txt|It could well be military.
p230_308.txt|His job was not advertised.
p230_309.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p230_310.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p230_311.txt|And we can do it.
p230_312.txt|The songs are just so good.
p230_313.txt|The casting is as perfect.
p230_314.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p230_315.txt|I must do something about it.
p230_316.txt|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p230_317.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p230_318.txt|They are not left wing.
p230_319.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p230_321.txt|It is a road of death.
p230_322.txt|The party lasted all night.
p230_323.txt|The group is not paying a dividend.
p230_324.txt|We were on our way.
p230_325.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p230_326.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p230_327.txt|We have a good healthy debate.
p230_328.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p230_329.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p230_330.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p230_331.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p230_332.txt|I can see their argument.
p230_333.txt|After some discussion they did.
p230_334.txt|It was always an option.
p230_335.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p230_336.txt|Did it work ?
p230_337.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p230_338.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p230_339.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p230_340.txt|You may have a short memory.
p230_341.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p230_342.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p230_343.txt|There was some merit in that.
p230_344.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p230_345.txt|The airport was even different.
p230_346.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p230_347.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p230_348.txt|There was no time scale.
p230_349.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p230_350.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p230_351.txt|He is not very big, either.
p230_352.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p230_353.txt|Even the one she loved.
p230_354.txt|You have no chance of planning permission.
p230_355.txt|We are encouraged by the news.
p230_356.txt|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
p230_357.txt|The professor said the results were positive.
p230_358.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p230_359.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p230_360.txt|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p230_361.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p230_362.txt|I am a lucky man.
p230_363.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p230_364.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p230_365.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p230_366.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p230_367.txt|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p230_368.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p230_369.txt|They have broken the promise.
p230_370.txt|We are really good friends.
p230_371.txt|My goal is quite simple.
p230_372.txt|This is a major championship.
p230_373.txt|It's going to be fun.
p230_374.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p230_375.txt|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
p230_376.txt|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p230_377.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p230_378.txt|We are a Scottish company.
p230_379.txt|We will win the argument.
p230_380.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p230_381.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p230_382.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p230_383.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p230_384.txt|The marshall at the turn was great.
p230_385.txt|If you can get it.
p230_386.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p230_387.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p230_388.txt|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p230_389.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p230_390.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p230_391.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p230_392.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p230_393.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p230_394.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p230_395.txt|Are they free ?
p230_396.txt|What are they for ?
p230_397.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p230_398.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p230_399.txt|That investment has now been secured.
p230_400.txt|It is a large number.
p230_401.txt|You will not feel a thing.
p230_402.txt|I've never seen a game like it.
p230_404.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p230_405.txt|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p230_406.txt|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
p230_407.txt|The casualties were not named.
p230_408.txt|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p230_409.txt|It had been on the cards.
p230_410.txt|The second goal was superb.
p230_411.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p230_413.txt|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p230_414.txt|It is the old story.
p230_415.txt|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p230_416.txt|No date has been set for a meeting.
p230_417.txt|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p231_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p231_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p231_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p231_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p231_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p231_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p231_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p231_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p231_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p231_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p231_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p231_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p231_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p231_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p231_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p231_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p231_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p231_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p231_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p231_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p231_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p231_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p231_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p231_025.txt|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p231_026.txt|I'd just like to play.
p231_027.txt|Because we do not need it.
p231_028.txt|There was a rush of water.
p231_029.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p231_030.txt|That deal is a joke.
p231_031.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p231_032.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p231_033.txt|It carried a double message.
p231_034.txt|That means an extra two years.
p231_035.txt|I became a widow overnight.
p231_036.txt|But he can turn on the charm.
p231_037.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p231_038.txt|The man became a reporter.
p231_039.txt|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
p231_040.txt|Last year, I was pretty bad.
p231_041.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p231_042.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p231_043.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p231_044.txt|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p231_045.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p231_046.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p231_047.txt|A win is a win.
p231_048.txt|There was no safety net.
p231_049.txt|There's nothing we could do about this.
p231_050.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p231_051.txt|We keep an eye on it.
p231_052.txt|We have not given up hope.
p231_053.txt|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231_054.txt|She said she was really sorry.
p231_055.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p231_056.txt|Italy is a beautiful place.
p231_057.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p231_058.txt|We should be able to cope.
p231_059.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p231_061.txt|So is that it, then ?
p231_062.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p231_063.txt|What do we do ?
p231_064.txt|It was a lovely experience.
p231_065.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231_066.txt|We will pay their bills.
p231_067.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p231_068.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p231_069.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p231_070.txt|This is an exciting new venture.
p231_071.txt|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p231_072.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p231_073.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p231_074.txt|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p231_076.txt|That would be too easy.
p231_078.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231_079.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p231_080.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p231_081.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p231_082.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p231_083.txt|They lived for their children.
p231_085.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p231_086.txt|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p231_087.txt|It is an old family habit.
p231_088.txt|He's been hit by it.
p231_089.txt|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p231_090.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p231_091.txt|But I know the course.
p231_092.txt|Their attitude is all wrong.
p231_093.txt|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p231_094.txt|You are like an animal.
p231_095.txt|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231_097.txt|We should recognise others have done a good job.
p231_098.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p231_099.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p231_100.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p231_101.txt|That time is not now, however.
p231_102.txt|It's not a quick fix.
p231_103.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p231_104.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p231_105.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p231_106.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p231_107.txt|And does it ?
p231_108.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p231_109.txt|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p231_110.txt|You'd better believe it.
p231_111.txt|New Year will be very busy.
p231_112.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p231_113.txt|It proved a good decision.
p231_114.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p231_115.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p231_116.txt|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p231_117.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p231_118.txt|Then again, we could have.
p231_119.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p231_120.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p231_121.txt|I was just a child.
p231_122.txt|We should not be surprised.
p231_123.txt|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p231_124.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p231_125.txt|That period was a struggle.
p231_126.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p231_127.txt|This should begin in October.
p231_128.txt|That is far too high.
p231_129.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p231_130.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p231_131.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p231_132.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p231_133.txt|It is a common problem.
p231_134.txt|You're a gambling man.
p231_135.txt|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p231_136.txt|He is a great addition to our team.
p231_137.txt|This is a successful outcome.
p231_138.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p231_139.txt|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231_140.txt|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p231_141.txt|I miss the freedom that I had.
p231_142.txt|It only increased the support for him.
p231_143.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p231_144.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p231_145.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p231_146.txt|It has become a way of life.
p231_147.txt|The whole industry is a shambles.
p231_148.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p231_149.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p231_150.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p231_151.txt|It is not normal practice.
p231_152.txt|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p231_153.txt|He was asked to quit.
p231_154.txt|A new school will be built.
p231_155.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p231_156.txt|It is a terrible tragedy.
p231_157.txt|He was right into football from an early age.
p231_158.txt|It is not like us.
p231_159.txt|What happened in that game ?
p231_160.txt|Are you going to win ?
p231_161.txt|Was it the wife ?
p231_162.txt|Why change it ?
p231_163.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p231_164.txt|He was in great spirits.
p231_165.txt|We have a budget in March.
p231_166.txt|You've been a great audience.
p231_167.txt|It is simply not true.
p231_168.txt|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p231_169.txt|It is really good news.
p231_170.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p231_171.txt|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p231_172.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p231_173.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p231_174.txt|One season, they might do well.
p231_175.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p231_176.txt|This much I can tell you.
p231_177.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p231_178.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p231_179.txt|But one was not enough.
p231_180.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p231_181.txt|I am not ready to walk away.
p231_183.txt|The shooting created panic in the street.
p231_184.txt|So many people will be affected by this.
p231_185.txt|As many as the market will support.
p231_186.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p231_188.txt|This is the time to use it.
p231_189.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p231_190.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p231_191.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p231_192.txt|People will ask about us.
p231_193.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p231_194.txt|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p231_195.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p231_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p231_197.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p231_198.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p231_199.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p231_200.txt|Libya is an easy target.
p231_201.txt|Does the name matter ?
p231_202.txt|how do you get it back ?
p231_203.txt|What are you no good at ?
p231_205.txt|Who was she ?
p231_206.txt|It gave no further details.
p231_207.txt|You've caught a serial killer.
p231_208.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p231_209.txt|We are a new department.
p231_210.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p231_211.txt|They are looking at flotation.
p231_212.txt|Which isn't a bad idea.
p231_213.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p231_214.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p231_215.txt|That might help a bit.
p231_216.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p231_217.txt|He has a lot of skill.
p231_218.txt|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p231_219.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p231_220.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p231_221.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p231_222.txt|That you can do it.
p231_223.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p231_224.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p231_225.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p231_226.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p231_228.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p231_229.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p231_230.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p231_231.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p231_232.txt|She died in middle age.
p231_233.txt|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p231_234.txt|It is set in Paris.
p231_235.txt|The irony was not lost.
p231_236.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p231_237.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p231_238.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p231_239.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p231_240.txt|It is now the big brother.
p231_241.txt|The parties have no contact.
p231_242.txt|She took them for a term.
p231_243.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p231_244.txt|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p231_245.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p231_246.txt|His is a global perspective.
p231_247.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p231_248.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p231_249.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p231_250.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p231_251.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p231_252.txt|But they were never expected to last.
p231_253.txt|It was a cry for help.
p231_254.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p231_255.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p231_256.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p231_257.txt|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p231_258.txt|It seems a shame to leave it.
p231_259.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p231_260.txt|The concerns are the same.
p231_261.txt|I can't get a job.
p231_262.txt|And they were being paid ?
p231_263.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p231_264.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p231_265.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p231_266.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p231_267.txt|Did he trip ?
p231_268.txt|I've had the time of my life.
p231_269.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p231_270.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p231_271.txt|I thought he might have been a bit.
p231_272.txt|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p231_273.txt|I'd never run for them.
p231_274.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p231_275.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p231_276.txt|These figures are truly terrible.
p231_277.txt|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231_278.txt|The joint bid is still on course.
p231_279.txt|At first I thought I was gone.
p231_280.txt|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p231_281.txt|They can leave at any time.
p231_282.txt|That view has not altered.
p231_283.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p231_284.txt|Blair also had a penalty.
p231_285.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p231_286.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p231_288.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p231_289.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p231_290.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p231_291.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p231_292.txt|I've lost all confidence.
p231_293.txt|This could be a mistake.
p231_294.txt|Once again, they would be wrong.
p231_295.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p231_296.txt|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p231_297.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p231_298.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p231_299.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p231_300.txt|But it is up again.
p231_301.txt|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p231_302.txt|It could well be military.
p231_303.txt|I was just so determined.
p231_304.txt|That was the difference between the sides.
p231_305.txt|The judge was really nice.
p231_307.txt|You are a different people.
p231_308.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p231_309.txt|He is still in shock.
p231_310.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p231_312.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p231_313.txt|I thought he did very well.
p231_314.txt|I'm not making any comment at all.
p231_315.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p231_316.txt|We're on our way.
p231_317.txt|They come to enjoy themselves.
p231_318.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p231_319.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p231_320.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p231_322.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p231_323.txt|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p231_324.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p231_325.txt|Have a look at this lot.
p231_326.txt|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p231_327.txt|The king is delighted by the honour.
p231_328.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p231_329.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p231_330.txt|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231_331.txt|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p231_332.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p231_333.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p231_334.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p231_336.txt|I think it's about time.
p231_337.txt|The airport was even different.
p231_338.txt|There was no time scale.
p231_339.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p231_340.txt|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p231_341.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p231_342.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p231_343.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p231_344.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p231_345.txt|Finally came the moment of truth.
p231_346.txt|We are encouraged by the news.
p231_347.txt|What form did that take ?
p231_348.txt|Are they free ?
p231_349.txt|What are they for ?
p231_350.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p231_351.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p231_352.txt|So what happens next ?
p231_353.txt|The units will not be replaced.
p231_354.txt|Neither man has been charged.
p231_355.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p231_357.txt|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p231_358.txt|I am a lucky man.
p231_359.txt|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p231_360.txt|I've always been a sensitive.
p231_361.txt|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p231_362.txt|You did not see it.
p231_363.txt|We live on an island.
p231_364.txt|It is not real life.
p231_365.txt|Neither woman has been named.
p231_366.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p231_367.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p231_368.txt|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231_369.txt|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p231_370.txt|This is a major championship.
p231_371.txt|The result is called a patent.
p231_372.txt|But we finished the show.
p231_373.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p231_374.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p231_375.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p231_376.txt|We were given a break.
p231_377.txt|In due course the deal was done.
p231_378.txt|to have products for their needs.
p231_379.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p231_380.txt|We will win the argument.
p231_381.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p231_382.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p231_383.txt|Is it worth it ?
p231_384.txt|Does it matter ?
p231_385.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p231_386.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p231_387.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p231_388.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p231_389.txt|That time may never be broken.
p231_390.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p231_391.txt|The response from them was good.
p231_392.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p231_393.txt|But we are very near.
p231_394.txt|That's as good as it gets.
p231_395.txt|A review is under way.
p231_396.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p231_397.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p231_398.txt|They have failed to deliver.
p231_399.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p231_400.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p231_401.txt|She is in their hands.
p231_402.txt|It is a large number.
p231_403.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p231_404.txt|It is hard to understand.
p231_405.txt|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p231_406.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p231_407.txt|There was an element of frustration.
p231_408.txt|I should think so, too.
p231_409.txt|How do you take them away ?
p231_411.txt|After the match, do you ?
p231_412.txt|I will always remember the horrible images.
p231_414.txt|They are looking for profit.
p231_415.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p231_416.txt|There is some light in the tunnel.
p231_417.txt|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p231_418.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p231_419.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p231_420.txt|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p231_421.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p231_422.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p231_423.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p231_424.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p231_426.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p231_427.txt|I would love to think that she could win.
p231_428.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p231_429.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p231_430.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p231_431.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p231_432.txt|I never had a childhood.
p231_433.txt|It is based on a true story.
p231_434.txt|But it can be done.
p231_435.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p231_436.txt|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p231_437.txt|The growth potential is enormous.
p231_438.txt|They are not left wing.
p231_439.txt|The British government does not want to know.
p231_440.txt|They said they were only young men.
p231_441.txt|We shall not forget him.
p231_442.txt|The people are the hero.
p231_443.txt|They made a huge impression on me.
p231_444.txt|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p231_445.txt|It sounded like a bomb.
p231_446.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p231_447.txt|We've got a good management record.
p231_448.txt|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p231_449.txt|And we might go back.
p231_450.txt|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p231_451.txt|We went straight into the bedroom.
p231_452.txt|Its future is no longer in question.
p231_453.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p231_454.txt|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p231_456.txt|They have to be met.
p231_457.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p231_458.txt|She has reached the top of her profession.
p231_459.txt|But he has a lifeline.
p231_460.txt|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p231_461.txt|They were good years for him.
p231_462.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p231_463.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p231_464.txt|Driving has been the key.
p231_465.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p231_466.txt|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p231_467.txt|Classes must be reduced by half.
p231_468.txt|War is not the action.
p231_469.txt|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p231_470.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p231_471.txt|Dennis was not so sure.
p231_472.txt|He felt it was the right time.
p231_473.txt|It was clear on Thursday.
p231_474.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p231_475.txt|It was all in a short period of time.
p231_476.txt|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p232_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p232_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p232_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p232_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p232_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p232_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p232_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p232_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p232_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p232_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p232_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p232_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p232_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p232_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p232_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p232_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p232_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p232_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p232_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p232_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p232_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p232_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p232_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p232_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p232_026.txt|But it failed.
p232_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232_028.txt|They should be so lucky.
p232_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p232_030.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232_031.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p232_032.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232_033.txt|I would love it.
p232_034.txt|It is marvellous.
p232_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_036.txt|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232_037.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p232_038.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p232_039.txt|I was scared.
p232_040.txt|Dancing was her life.
p232_041.txt|I suspect the latter.
p232_042.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_043.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p232_044.txt|We will push.
p232_045.txt|It is urgent.
p232_046.txt|The judge said.
p232_047.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p232_048.txt|But it might have done.
p232_049.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p232_050.txt|They had to explain it.
p232_051.txt|Here's a clue.
p232_052.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_053.txt|It's the big omission.
p232_054.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055.txt|It's very odd.
p232_056.txt|Because we do not need it.
p232_057.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p232_058.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059.txt|That's the truth.
p232_060.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p232_061.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232_062.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063.txt|You do not change overnight.
p232_064.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p232_065.txt|He was popular.
p232_066.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p232_067.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_068.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p232_069.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p232_070.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p232_071.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232_072.txt|That was the easy election.
p232_073.txt|There could be a way back.
p232_074.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p232_075.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p232_076.txt|I had my suspicions.
p232_077.txt|It was chaotic.
p232_078.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p232_079.txt|He is now resident in England.
p232_080.txt|I've got the shirt.
p232_081.txt|Today she has been released.
p232_082.txt|What has changed ?
p232_083.txt|That is bound to happen.
p232_084.txt|I will miss him.
p232_085.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p232_086.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p232_087.txt|No progress has been made.
p232_088.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p232_089.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p232_090.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p232_091.txt|It is a lifeline.
p232_092.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p232_093.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p232_094.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232_095.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p232_096.txt|Then came the crunch.
p232_097.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232_098.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p232_099.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232_100.txt|It was mayhem.
p232_101.txt|They were outside the circle.
p232_102.txt|It was a good performance.
p232_103.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p232_104.txt|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p232_105.txt|That is no use.
p232_106.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p232_107.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p232_108.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p232_109.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p232_110.txt|I don't have many friends.
p232_111.txt|He was jailed for a year.
p232_112.txt|You had better believe it.
p232_113.txt|It's not fair.
p232_114.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232_115.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p232_116.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p232_117.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232_118.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232_119.txt|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232_120.txt|It is rubbish.
p232_121.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p232_122.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232_123.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232_124.txt|That's all right then.
p232_125.txt|I'm so angry.
p232_126.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232_127.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p232_128.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p232_129.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232_130.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p232_131.txt|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232_132.txt|I am now unemployed.
p232_133.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p232_134.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p232_135.txt|Our intentions are real.
p232_136.txt|They took a risk.
p232_137.txt|The goals were good.
p232_138.txt|What will happen then ?
p232_139.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p232_140.txt|He is severe.
p232_141.txt|She died at her home.
p232_142.txt|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p232_143.txt|They did very well.
p232_144.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p232_145.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p232_146.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p232_147.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p232_148.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p232_149.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232_150.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p232_151.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232_152.txt|It was by the numbers.
p232_153.txt|I was in daily contact.
p232_154.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p232_155.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p232_156.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p232_158.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232_159.txt|We have to move forward.
p232_160.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232_161.txt|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232_162.txt|Tell it like it was ?
p232_163.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p232_164.txt|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p232_165.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p232_166.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p232_167.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p232_168.txt|That will do for me.
p232_169.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232_170.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p232_171.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p232_172.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p232_173.txt|It became a book by itself.
p232_174.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p232_175.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232_176.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p232_177.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p232_178.txt|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232_179.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p232_180.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p232_181.txt|The clarity is vital.
p232_182.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p232_183.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p232_184.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p232_185.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232_186.txt|It is the whole package.
p232_187.txt|I've been there.
p232_188.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232_189.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p232_190.txt|We did everything by the book.
p232_191.txt|I wish I could say something.
p232_192.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p232_193.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p232_194.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232_195.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p232_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p232_197.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232_198.txt|The conference is the first test.
p232_199.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p232_200.txt|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_201.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p232_202.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232_203.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p232_204.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232_205.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p232_206.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p232_207.txt|I don't want to use it.
p232_208.txt|Now, it's all right.
p232_209.txt|There was an e-mail.
p232_210.txt|That's the day job.
p232_211.txt|Feel the heat ?
p232_212.txt|He knows a lot.
p232_213.txt|He is slightly confused.
p232_214.txt|She should not be blamed.
p232_215.txt|His third goal was superb.
p232_216.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p232_217.txt|It's not ideal.
p232_218.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p232_219.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232_220.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232_221.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232_223.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p232_224.txt|That has been the easy part.
p232_225.txt|We've got the bronze.
p232_226.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p232_227.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232_228.txt|It was good fun.
p232_229.txt|What was the main difference ?
p232_230.txt|I am immensely sad.
p232_231.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p232_232.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232_233.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p232_234.txt|But she was.
p232_235.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p232_236.txt|We were awful.
p232_237.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p232_238.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p232_239.txt|It is set in Paris.
p232_240.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232_241.txt|It's quite nice.
p232_242.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p232_243.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p232_244.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p232_245.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p232_246.txt|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232_247.txt|She is well balanced.
p232_248.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232_249.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p232_250.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_251.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p232_252.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232_253.txt|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_254.txt|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232_255.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p232_256.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p232_257.txt|I can't get a job.
p232_258.txt|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232_259.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232_260.txt|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232_261.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232_262.txt|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232_263.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232_264.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232_265.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p232_266.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p232_267.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232_268.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p232_269.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232_270.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p232_271.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p232_272.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p232_273.txt|He was also married with two children.
p232_274.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p232_275.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232_276.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p232_277.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232_278.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p232_279.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p232_280.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p232_281.txt|It's a way of life.
p232_282.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p232_283.txt|I am an estate agent.
p232_284.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p232_285.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p232_286.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p232_287.txt|It happens from time to time.
p232_288.txt|He looked very sharp.
p232_289.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232_290.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p232_291.txt|They were also beside themselves.
p232_292.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p232_293.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232_294.txt|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232_295.txt|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p232_296.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p232_297.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p232_298.txt|He should have won.
p232_299.txt|He has retired.
p232_300.txt|What has altered ?
p232_301.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p232_302.txt|Nothing is safe.
p232_303.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232_305.txt|They are wrong.
p232_306.txt|It is a road of death.
p232_307.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232_308.txt|We are in the end game.
p232_309.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232_310.txt|He was solid.
p232_311.txt|Special measures were needed.
p232_312.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p232_313.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p232_314.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p232_315.txt|Kids are terrible.
p232_316.txt|It should be equal.
p232_317.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p232_318.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p232_319.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p232_320.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p232_321.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p232_322.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p232_323.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p232_324.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232_325.txt|Off with their heads.
p232_326.txt|It's not long enough.
p232_327.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p232_328.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p232_329.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p232_330.txt|It could have gone either way.
p232_331.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p232_332.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p232_333.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p232_334.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232_335.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p232_336.txt|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232_337.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232_338.txt|The team for the first game could be this one.
p232_339.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p232_340.txt|Who will do it ?
p232_341.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232_342.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232_343.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p232_344.txt|He has to learn.
p232_345.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p232_346.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p232_347.txt|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232_348.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232_349.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232_350.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p232_351.txt|Everything was an effort.
p232_352.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p232_353.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p232_354.txt|It is long gone.
p232_355.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232_356.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232_357.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p232_358.txt|It's not that clear-cut.
p232_359.txt|She is free.
p232_360.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232_361.txt|I kept going for her.
p232_362.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p232_363.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232_364.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232_365.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p232_366.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p232_367.txt|He has seen the past.
p232_368.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p232_369.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232_370.txt|We will be homeless.
p232_371.txt|The scene is about this ?
p232_372.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p232_373.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232_374.txt|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232_375.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p232_376.txt|He could make it.
p232_377.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p232_378.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p232_379.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p232_380.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232_381.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p232_382.txt|Five members were disciplined.
p232_383.txt|Talks are progressing.
p232_384.txt|There is no signature.
p232_385.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p232_386.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232_387.txt|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232_388.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p232_389.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p232_390.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p232_391.txt|You thought it was a headache.
p232_392.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p232_393.txt|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232_394.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p232_395.txt|We're looking for justice.
p232_396.txt|I can lead by example.
p232_397.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232_398.txt|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_399.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232_400.txt|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232_401.txt|It is legally binding.
p232_402.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p232_403.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p232_404.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p232_405.txt|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p232_406.txt|He was a crazy man.
p232_407.txt|We should have known.
p232_408.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p232_409.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232_410.txt|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232_411.txt|You wanted the evidence.
p232_412.txt|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232_413.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p232_414.txt|I was very young.
p232_415.txt|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p233_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p233_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p233_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p233_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p233_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p233_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p233_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p233_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p233_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p233_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p233_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p233_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p233_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p233_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p233_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p233_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p233_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p233_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p233_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p233_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p233_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p233_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p233_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p233_025.txt|We are a service industry.
p233_026.txt|But we will have to wait.
p233_027.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p233_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p233_029.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p233_030.txt|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p233_032.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p233_033.txt|This is a central issue.
p233_037.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233_038.txt|Victory was never in doubt.
p233_039.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p233_040.txt|We are the party of the future.
p233_041.txt|I have never been a member of the council.
p233_042.txt|He was in his element.
p233_043.txt|That means an extra two years.
p233_044.txt|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_045.txt|All businesses continue to trade.
p233_046.txt|The man became a reporter.
p233_047.txt|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_048.txt|It is all starting to come together.
p233_049.txt|Part of the complex is historic.
p233_050.txt|The strategy is not without risk.
p233_051.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p233_052.txt|I was released after six days.
p233_053.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p233_054.txt|We are working on it.
p233_055.txt|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_056.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_057.txt|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p233_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p233_059.txt|There was no safety net.
p233_060.txt|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_061.txt|You have to be patient.
p233_062.txt|That is all in the past.
p233_063.txt|That could be a mistake.
p233_064.txt|It was an amazing result.
p233_065.txt|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p233_066.txt|He has not been dropped.
p233_067.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p233_068.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_070.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p233_071.txt|She did that for the rest of her life.
p233_072.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p233_073.txt|It starts with the script.
p233_074.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p233_075.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p233_076.txt|We can all make a mistake.
p233_077.txt|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p233_079.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_080.txt|On the night, it was not enough.
p233_081.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p233_082.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p233_083.txt|They were badly prepared for it.
p233_084.txt|It is not a story.
p233_085.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p233_086.txt|How are you, sir ?
p233_087.txt|So is that it, then ?
p233_088.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p233_089.txt|What do we do ?
p233_090.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p233_091.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233_092.txt|They have a further report to make in March.
p233_093.txt|He is in the US.
p233_094.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233_095.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p233_096.txt|I had a bit in hand.
p233_097.txt|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p233_098.txt|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p233_099.txt|That is the fact of the matter.
p233_100.txt|It should be a condition of employment.
p233_101.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_102.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p233_103.txt|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_104.txt|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p233_105.txt|He has become a monster.
p233_106.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p233_107.txt|Everyone had to play the game.
p233_108.txt|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233_109.txt|It is not affected by the sale.
p233_110.txt|We are currently working on the details.
p233_111.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p233_112.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p233_113.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p233_114.txt|It was the eighties.
p233_115.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p233_116.txt|You had better believe it.
p233_117.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233_118.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p233_119.txt|My office is bare.
p233_120.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p233_121.txt|I joined a group.
p233_122.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233_123.txt|Who would be a referee?
p233_125.txt|That's all right then.
p233_126.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p233_127.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233_128.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233_129.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p233_130.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233_131.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233_132.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p233_133.txt|It's an amazing landscape!
p233_134.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233_135.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233_136.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p233_137.txt|I am now unemployed.
p233_138.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p233_139.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p233_140.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233_141.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233_142.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233_143.txt|Is that it ?
p233_144.txt|I saw some terrible things.
p233_146.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p233_147.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p233_148.txt|Who would be right ?
p233_149.txt|She died at her home.
p233_150.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233_151.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233_152.txt|It is like a football team.
p233_153.txt|It would be a last resort.
p233_154.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233_155.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p233_156.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p233_157.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p233_158.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p233_159.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233_160.txt|I was so nervous.
p233_161.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p233_162.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p233_163.txt|It is not normal practice.
p233_164.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233_165.txt|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p233_166.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p233_167.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p233_168.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233_169.txt|It is so unfair.
p233_170.txt|I will tell you.
p233_171.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233_172.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233_173.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p233_174.txt|It's that sort of night.
p233_175.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p233_176.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p233_177.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p233_178.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p233_179.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233_180.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p233_181.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p233_182.txt|He will feel the pain again.
p233_183.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p233_184.txt|Is Saddam a threat ?
p233_185.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p233_186.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p233_187.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p233_188.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p233_189.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233_190.txt|I was totally wrong.
p233_191.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p233_192.txt|I've been there.
p233_193.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p233_194.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p233_195.txt|It's a joke.
p233_196.txt|I had a train to catch.
p233_197.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233_198.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233_199.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p233_200.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233_201.txt|He may need it.
p233_203.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p233_204.txt|It wasn't to be.
p233_208.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p233_209.txt|I have a cold.
p233_210.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p233_211.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p233_212.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p233_213.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p233_214.txt|That will be vital.
p233_215.txt|We need to handle it.
p233_216.txt|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233_217.txt|I had relied on him.
p233_218.txt|His third goal was superb.
p233_220.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p233_221.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p233_222.txt|Work has started.
p233_223.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233_224.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233_225.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p233_226.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p233_228.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p233_229.txt|You have to do your research.
p233_230.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p233_231.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233_232.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p233_233.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233_234.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p233_235.txt|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p233_236.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p233_237.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p233_238.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233_239.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p233_240.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233_241.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233_242.txt|We were extremely poor.
p233_243.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p233_244.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p233_245.txt|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233_246.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233_247.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p233_248.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p233_249.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233_250.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p233_251.txt|It was a cry for help.
p233_252.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p233_253.txt|This year I understood.
p233_254.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p233_255.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233_256.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233_257.txt|I watched a game.
p233_258.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p233_259.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233_260.txt|I was happily surprised.
p233_261.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233_262.txt|It is also very valuable.
p233_263.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233_264.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233_265.txt|It is not just about pay.
p233_266.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p233_267.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233_268.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p233_269.txt|They are never here.
p233_270.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233_271.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p233_272.txt|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233_273.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p233_274.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p233_275.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p233_276.txt|It is the same in Sweden.
p233_277.txt|And Michael was just great.
p233_278.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233_279.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p233_280.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233_281.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233_282.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233_283.txt|I feel pretty good.
p233_284.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p233_285.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p233_286.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p233_288.txt|They were too hard.
p233_289.txt|He looked very sharp.
p233_290.txt|All options are open.
p233_291.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p233_292.txt|It was a virus.
p233_294.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233_295.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p233_296.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_297.txt|Who can predict ?
p233_298.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p233_299.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p233_300.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p233_301.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233_302.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p233_303.txt|One was a lawyer.
p233_304.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p233_305.txt|They should be swept away.
p233_306.txt|This is a war over our home.
p233_307.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233_308.txt|I was in daily contact.
p233_309.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p233_310.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p233_311.txt|Is there on his hands ?
p233_312.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p233_313.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p233_314.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233_315.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p233_316.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p233_317.txt|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p233_319.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p233_320.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p233_321.txt|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233_322.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p233_323.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p233_324.txt|I saw some good things.
p233_325.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233_326.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p233_327.txt|It added to the spectacle.
p233_328.txt|Who was the mystery MP ?
p233_329.txt|He told the court.
p233_330.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p233_331.txt|Who will do it ?
p233_332.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p233_333.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233_334.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p233_335.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233_336.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233_337.txt|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233_338.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p233_339.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p233_340.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233_341.txt|The composer will conduct.
p233_342.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p233_343.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233_344.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p233_345.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p233_346.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233_347.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p233_348.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233_349.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p233_350.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p233_351.txt|He agreed with my proposal.
p233_352.txt|Hartley should know.
p233_353.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233_354.txt|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233_355.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233_356.txt|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p233_357.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p233_358.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_359.txt|He could make it.
p233_360.txt|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233_361.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p233_362.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233_363.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p233_364.txt|They received a reply from their own managers.
p233_365.txt|But I managed.
p233_366.txt|They play together perfectly.
p233_367.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233_368.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p233_369.txt|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_370.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p233_371.txt|We shall not be moved.
p233_373.txt|It was a hit.
p233_374.txt|He's a nice guy.
p233_375.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233_376.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p233_377.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233_378.txt|The mood was defiant.
p233_379.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p233_381.txt|It's just outrageous.
p233_382.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p233_383.txt|It is unusual.
p233_384.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p233_385.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233_386.txt|That set the tone.
p233_387.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p233_388.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p233_389.txt|What happened in the summer ?
p233_390.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233_391.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233_392.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p234_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p234_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p234_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p234_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p234_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p234_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p234_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p234_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p234_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p234_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p234_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p234_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p234_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p234_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p234_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p234_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p234_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p234_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p234_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p234_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p234_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p234_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p234_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p234_025.txt|We are a service industry.
p234_026.txt|But we will have to wait.
p234_027.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p234_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p234_029.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p234_030.txt|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p234_031.txt|It is on the internet.
p234_032.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p234_033.txt|This is a central issue.
p234_034.txt|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p234_035.txt|History is in the making.
p234_036.txt|It was sold at a loss.
p234_037.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234_038.txt|Victory was never in doubt.
p234_039.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p234_040.txt|We are the party of the future.
p234_041.txt|I have never been a member of the council.
p234_042.txt|He was in his element.
p234_043.txt|That means an extra two years.
p234_044.txt|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234_045.txt|All businesses continue to trade.
p234_046.txt|The man became a reporter.
p234_047.txt|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234_048.txt|It is all starting to come together.
p234_049.txt|Part of the complex is historic.
p234_050.txt|The strategy is not without risk.
p234_051.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p234_052.txt|I was released after six days.
p234_053.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p234_054.txt|We are working on it.
p234_055.txt|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234_056.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p234_057.txt|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p234_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p234_059.txt|There was no safety net.
p234_060.txt|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234_061.txt|You have to be patient.
p234_062.txt|That is all in the past.
p234_063.txt|That could be a mistake.
p234_064.txt|It was an amazing result.
p234_065.txt|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p234_066.txt|He has not been dropped.
p234_067.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p234_068.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p234_069.txt|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234_070.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p234_071.txt|She did that for the rest of her life.
p234_072.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p234_073.txt|It starts with the script.
p234_074.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p234_075.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p234_076.txt|We can all make a mistake.
p234_077.txt|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p234_079.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p234_080.txt|On the night, it was not enough.
p234_081.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p234_082.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p234_083.txt|They were badly prepared for it.
p234_084.txt|It is not a story.
p234_085.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p234_086.txt|How are you, sir ?
p234_087.txt|So is that it, then ?
p234_088.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p234_089.txt|What do we do ?
p234_090.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p234_091.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p234_092.txt|They have a further report to make in March.
p234_093.txt|He is in the US.
p234_094.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p234_095.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p234_096.txt|I had a bit in hand.
p234_097.txt|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p234_098.txt|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p234_099.txt|That is the fact of the matter.
p234_100.txt|It should be a condition of employment.
p234_101.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p234_102.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p234_103.txt|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p234_104.txt|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p234_105.txt|He has become a monster.
p234_106.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p234_107.txt|Everyone had to play the game.
p234_108.txt|In London today, it was business as usual.
p234_109.txt|It is not affected by the sale.
p234_110.txt|We are currently working on the details.
p234_111.txt|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p234_112.txt|That would be a serious problem.
p234_113.txt|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
p234_114.txt|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234_115.txt|She is not a victim.
p234_116.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p234_117.txt|And we had a good response.
p234_118.txt|When we looked at the company.
p234_119.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p234_120.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p234_121.txt|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234_122.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p234_123.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p234_124.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p234_125.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p234_126.txt|He wanted to record the group.
p234_127.txt|However, it was a different story in the final.
p234_128.txt|The end result is the same.
p234_129.txt|Three days later, he was killed.
p234_130.txt|We are committed to the ban.
p234_131.txt|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234_132.txt|The problem was a social problem.
p234_133.txt|He had no money left to run the club.
p234_134.txt|It is not so simple.
p234_135.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p234_136.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p234_137.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p234_138.txt|And does it ?
p234_139.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p234_140.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p234_141.txt|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p234_142.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p234_143.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p234_144.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p234_145.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p234_146.txt|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p234_147.txt|She does not want to speak.
p234_148.txt|It is expected to last a week.
p234_149.txt|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234_150.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p234_151.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p234_152.txt|But it is different in different regions.
p234_153.txt|That is the nature of the game.
p234_154.txt|There is a spring in the step.
p234_155.txt|We want to get there.
p234_156.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p234_157.txt|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234_158.txt|The players were under pressure.
p234_159.txt|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234_160.txt|There is no common ground.
p234_161.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p234_162.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p234_163.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p234_164.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p234_165.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p234_166.txt|At the moment we do not understand it.
p234_167.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p234_168.txt|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p234_169.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p234_170.txt|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p234_171.txt|Much of the equipment was new.
p234_172.txt|I have had a good life.
p234_173.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p234_174.txt|That was the difference between the sides.
p234_175.txt|They have not been named.
p234_176.txt|I was in a hole.
p234_177.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p234_178.txt|I was always in control.
p234_179.txt|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p234_180.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p234_181.txt|He was asked to quit.
p234_182.txt|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p234_183.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p234_184.txt|They were not seeking the right to strike.
p234_185.txt|He called for a public inquiry.
p234_186.txt|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
p234_187.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p234_188.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p234_189.txt|It is simply not true.
p234_190.txt|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
p234_191.txt|It is not in the public interest.
p234_192.txt|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p234_193.txt|The performance is not there.
p234_194.txt|It would make a lot of sense.
p234_195.txt|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p234_196.txt|Clearly, they had other problems.
p234_197.txt|He has defended the system.
p234_198.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p234_199.txt|I could not sit in the stands.
p234_200.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p234_201.txt|They have to get that sorted.
p234_202.txt|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234_203.txt|We can take the city.
p234_204.txt|Are you going to win ?
p234_205.txt|Was it the wife ?
p234_207.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p234_208.txt|Does the name matter ?
p234_209.txt|I will be in Scotland.
p234_210.txt|It was the story of the second half.
p234_211.txt|The trading conditions are not good.
p234_212.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p234_213.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p234_214.txt|This is an interesting link.
p234_216.txt|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p234_217.txt|Being investor ready is a good start.
p234_218.txt|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p234_219.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p234_220.txt|This conference was never confirmed.
p234_221.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p234_222.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p234_223.txt|He must have a crack at it.
p234_224.txt|The force is with them.
p234_225.txt|Her experience is certainly limited.
p234_226.txt|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p234_227.txt|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p234_228.txt|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p234_229.txt|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p234_230.txt|He intends to restart in the spring.
p234_231.txt|He is a good friend.
p234_232.txt|It is the strength of the school.
p234_233.txt|But it may not be all bad news.
p234_234.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p234_235.txt|The conference is the first test.
p234_236.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p234_237.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p234_238.txt|I was not overly concerned about this.
p234_239.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p234_240.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p234_241.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p234_242.txt|And they were being paid ?
p234_243.txt|Was everything done to save people ?
p234_244.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p234_245.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p234_246.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p234_247.txt|Did he trip ?
p234_248.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p234_249.txt|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
p234_250.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p234_251.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p234_252.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p234_253.txt|It was just another play.
p234_254.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p234_255.txt|The world is a good place.
p234_256.txt|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234_257.txt|The matter is under appeal.
p234_258.txt|I am delighted for them.
p234_259.txt|It was a great experience.
p234_260.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p234_261.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p234_262.txt|His second was a beauty.
p234_263.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p234_264.txt|Scotland played a major part in the project.
p234_265.txt|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p234_266.txt|Not in this production he doesn't.
p234_267.txt|We can certainly build on this.
p234_268.txt|Then was the summer of their discontent.
p234_269.txt|There is a world of difference.
p234_270.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p234_271.txt|Well, it was certainly different.
p234_272.txt|We want this place to work.
p234_273.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p234_274.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p234_275.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p234_276.txt|The performance continues to improve.
p234_277.txt|That would be a danger.
p234_278.txt|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p234_279.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p234_280.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p234_281.txt|I had to be into it.
p234_282.txt|My view has always been the same.
p234_283.txt|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p234_284.txt|It is set in Paris.
p234_285.txt|Do you think we're a top nation ?
p234_286.txt|Is our children learning ?
p234_287.txt|How independent is that ?
p234_288.txt|What form did that take ?
p234_289.txt|Are they free ?
p234_290.txt|The party has never fully recovered.
p234_291.txt|In many ways, that is as important.
p234_292.txt|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p234_293.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p234_294.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p234_295.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p234_296.txt|The results are expected within days.
p234_297.txt|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p234_298.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p234_299.txt|We were well worth the win.
p234_300.txt|And it was this one.
p234_301.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p234_302.txt|But it was also hard.
p234_303.txt|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234_304.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p234_305.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p234_306.txt|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p234_307.txt|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p234_308.txt|The concerns are the same.
p234_309.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p234_310.txt|Scotland won by six wickets.
p234_311.txt|It has to be enforced.
p234_312.txt|And we can do it.
p234_313.txt|Every one is a winner.
p234_314.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p234_315.txt|They have set the standard.
p234_316.txt|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p234_317.txt|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p234_318.txt|The existing structure is in trouble.
p234_319.txt|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p234_320.txt|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234_321.txt|You have to count on other people.
p234_322.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p234_323.txt|And he's the real thing.
p234_324.txt|What are they for ?
p234_325.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p234_326.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p234_327.txt|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p234_328.txt|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p234_329.txt|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234_330.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p234_331.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p234_332.txt|But it can be done.
p234_333.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p234_334.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p234_335.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p234_336.txt|This could be a mistake.
p234_337.txt|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p234_338.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p234_339.txt|I think the overall picture is still strong.
p234_340.txt|That is always a problem.
p234_341.txt|We will deliver at director level.
p234_342.txt|We did something about it.
p234_343.txt|The market is the market.
p234_344.txt|We do not have the papers.
p234_345.txt|However, the devil is in the detail.
p234_346.txt|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p234_347.txt|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p234_348.txt|The answer was in space.
p234_349.txt|We are not interested in dividends.
p234_350.txt|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234_351.txt|His concern is only for the future.
p234_352.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p234_353.txt|They have to be addressed.
p234_354.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p234_355.txt|However, a bid was never made.
p234_356.txt|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234_357.txt|The City welcomed the numbers.
p234_358.txt|Something is going to have to give.
p234_359.txt|There's still a bit to go.
p234_360.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p234_361.txt|We never played at all.
p236_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p236_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p236_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p236_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p236_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p236_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p236_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p236_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p236_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p236_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p236_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p236_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p236_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p236_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p236_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p236_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p236_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p236_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p236_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p236_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p236_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p236_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236_026.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p236_027.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p236_028.txt|Because we do not need it.
p236_029.txt|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_030.txt|And we have a singer.
p236_031.txt|He was jailed for four years.
p236_032.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p236_033.txt|This is a central issue.
p236_034.txt|He works at the airport.
p236_035.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p236_036.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p236_037.txt|It carried a double message.
p236_038.txt|That means an extra two years.
p236_039.txt|That was the case with David.
p236_040.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236_041.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p236_042.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p236_043.txt|Their campaign is in disarray.
p236_044.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p236_045.txt|We are working on it.
p236_046.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p236_047.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p236_048.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236_049.txt|This is the interesting part.
p236_050.txt|I haven't been ill at all.
p236_051.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236_052.txt|That was the difference today.
p236_053.txt|We keep an eye on it.
p236_054.txt|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_055.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p236_056.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_057.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_058.txt|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_059.txt|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p236_060.txt|I have proved that in the past.
p236_061.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_062.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p236_063.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p236_064.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p236_065.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p236_066.txt|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p236_068.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_069.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p236_070.txt|He was seen as the enemy.
p236_071.txt|It looks like a hit.
p236_072.txt|These people are not big names.
p236_073.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p236_074.txt|We did it for the jersey.
p236_075.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p236_076.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p236_077.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p236_078.txt|He was just a journalist.
p236_079.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p236_080.txt|They lived for their children.
p236_081.txt|We have turned the corner.
p236_083.txt|The Queen Mother is dead.
p236_084.txt|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_085.txt|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236_086.txt|It was a big departure.
p236_087.txt|Does it matter ?
p236_088.txt|How do you take them away ?
p236_089.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p236_090.txt|After the match, do you ?
p236_091.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_092.txt|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p236_093.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p236_094.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_095.txt|I had a ball today.
p236_096.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p236_097.txt|That time is not now, however.
p236_098.txt|We created so many chances.
p236_099.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p236_100.txt|Our house was very small.
p236_101.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_102.txt|It became difficult for me.
p236_103.txt|It's not a lack of effort.
p236_104.txt|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p236_105.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p236_107.txt|They will notice a difference.
p236_108.txt|Football is a passion for many.
p236_109.txt|New Year will be very busy.
p236_110.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p236_111.txt|The result is a vacuum.
p236_112.txt|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236_113.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p236_114.txt|The hearing was due to continue today.
p236_115.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p236_116.txt|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p236_117.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236_118.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p236_119.txt|Which can happen any time.
p236_120.txt|The colours are very pretty.
p236_121.txt|He is a lovely man.
p236_122.txt|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p236_123.txt|I was on a roll.
p236_124.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236_125.txt|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236_126.txt|He said to give a local injection.
p236_127.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p236_128.txt|You are a gambling man.
p236_129.txt|Before it was an ordeal.
p236_130.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p236_131.txt|We will try to find someone.
p236_132.txt|They could use a boost.
p236_133.txt|She died at her home.
p236_134.txt|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p236_135.txt|I enjoy the creative process.
p236_136.txt|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236_137.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p236_138.txt|It was a piece of art.
p236_139.txt|That view has not altered.
p236_140.txt|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p236_141.txt|So I got a blood test.
p236_142.txt|It has become a way of life.
p236_143.txt|The whole industry is a shambles.
p236_144.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p236_145.txt|We will provide immediate access.
p236_146.txt|He could do nothing about it.
p236_147.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p236_148.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p236_149.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p236_151.txt|It was by the numbers.
p236_152.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p236_153.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236_154.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236_155.txt|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236_156.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p236_157.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p236_158.txt|We did what we had to do.
p236_159.txt|It's not like us.
p236_161.txt|It is not a financial issue.
p236_162.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p236_163.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p236_164.txt|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236_165.txt|We have a budget in March.
p236_166.txt|He is not a team captain.
p236_167.txt|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_168.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p236_169.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p236_170.txt|That is not the case.
p236_172.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p236_173.txt|They could not match it.
p236_174.txt|Are they free ?
p236_175.txt|What are they for ?
p236_176.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p236_177.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178.txt|So what happens next ?
p236_179.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p236_180.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p236_181.txt|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p236_182.txt|One season, they might do well.
p236_183.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p236_184.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236_185.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p236_186.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p236_187.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p236_188.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p236_189.txt|Tomorrow is a new day.
p236_190.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p236_191.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p236_192.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p236_193.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p236_194.txt|I had too much to drink.
p236_195.txt|As many as the market will support.
p236_196.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p236_197.txt|That is a waste of energy.
p236_198.txt|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236_199.txt|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_200.txt|I had a train to catch.
p236_201.txt|It shows the strength of the roots.
p236_202.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p236_203.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p236_204.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p236_205.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p236_206.txt|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236_207.txt|My duty is to win.
p236_208.txt|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p236_209.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236_210.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p236_211.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p236_212.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p236_213.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p236_214.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p236_215.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p236_216.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236_217.txt|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p236_218.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p236_219.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p236_220.txt|You are a great player.
p236_221.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p236_222.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p236_223.txt|They are looking at a flotation.
p236_224.txt|Which isn't a bad idea.
p236_225.txt|There is no quick fix.
p236_226.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p236_227.txt|That might help a bit.
p236_228.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p236_229.txt|Death is outside the language.
p236_230.txt|I had relied on him.
p236_231.txt|The course has helped a lot.
p236_232.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p236_233.txt|It had all been arranged.
p236_234.txt|His third goal was superb.
p236_235.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p236_236.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p236_237.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p236_238.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p236_239.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236_240.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p236_241.txt|They said that they stood by their statement.
p236_242.txt|You have to do your research.
p236_243.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p236_244.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p236_245.txt|Truth is the child of time.
p236_246.txt|And they were being paid ?
p236_247.txt|Was everything done to save people ?
p236_249.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p236_250.txt|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p236_251.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236_252.txt|It's important to get it right.
p236_253.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p236_254.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p236_255.txt|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p236_256.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236_257.txt|I was just a kid.
p236_258.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p236_259.txt|It was quite a new prescription.
p236_260.txt|It is very hard for her.
p236_261.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236_262.txt|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236_263.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p236_264.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236_265.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p236_266.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p236_267.txt|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p236_268.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236_269.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p236_270.txt|But they were never expected to last.
p236_271.txt|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236_272.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p236_273.txt|I told you I was ill.
p236_274.txt|He will go on the bench.
p236_275.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p236_276.txt|We accept the new rules.
p236_277.txt|We run within the law.
p236_278.txt|We have the moral high ground.
p236_279.txt|He took over our lives.
p236_280.txt|It has all been done in secret.
p236_281.txt|They must play for each other.
p236_282.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p236_283.txt|She always wanted her own way.
p236_284.txt|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p236_285.txt|They can leave at any time.
p236_286.txt|Much of the equipment was new.
p236_287.txt|Blair also had a penalty.
p236_288.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p236_289.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p236_290.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p236_291.txt|My body is a wreck.
p236_292.txt|She failed in her action.
p236_293.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p236_294.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p236_295.txt|And that match was played in June.
p236_296.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p236_297.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p236_298.txt|Does the name matter ?
p236_299.txt|how do you get it back ?
p236_300.txt|What are you not good at ?
p236_301.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p236_302.txt|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p236_303.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236_304.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p236_305.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236_306.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p236_307.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p236_308.txt|I was there five months ago.
p236_309.txt|I am a retailer by nature.
p236_310.txt|His job was not advertised.
p236_311.txt|We can work all night.
p236_312.txt|It was really very frightening.
p236_313.txt|It was an excellent performance.
p236_314.txt|The answer is with ourselves.
p236_315.txt|And we can do it.
p236_316.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p236_317.txt|That is the real test.
p236_318.txt|They have to be addressed.
p236_319.txt|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236_320.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p236_321.txt|All winners should be tested.
p236_322.txt|I can live with it.
p236_323.txt|A lot has been written.
p236_324.txt|And he goes with it.
p236_325.txt|The law will take its course.
p236_326.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p236_327.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p236_328.txt|After some discussion they did.
p236_329.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p236_330.txt|I didn't have the reply.
p236_331.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236_332.txt|These days will be back.
p236_333.txt|You may have a short memory.
p236_335.txt|There was no time scale.
p236_336.txt|That decision has already been made.
p236_337.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p236_338.txt|The game is now open.
p236_339.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236_340.txt|Even the one she loved.
p236_341.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p236_342.txt|It was almost too much.
p236_343.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p236_344.txt|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236_345.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p236_346.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p236_347.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p236_348.txt|The confidence isn't there now.
p236_349.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p236_350.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p236_351.txt|He had no previous convictions.
p236_352.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p236_353.txt|What do we do ?
p236_354.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p236_355.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p236_356.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p236_357.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236_358.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p236_359.txt|Scotland is the home of golf.
p236_360.txt|They have broken that promise.
p236_361.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p236_362.txt|It's only a matter of scale.
p236_363.txt|We must put a marker down.
p236_364.txt|She said they would appeal.
p236_365.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p236_366.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p236_367.txt|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p236_368.txt|It was like a weekly wage.
p236_369.txt|We are a Scottish company.
p236_370.txt|They will fight for everything.
p236_371.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p236_372.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p236_373.txt|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p236_374.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236_375.txt|Everyone could see the joke.
p236_376.txt|All would be under threat.
p236_377.txt|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_378.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p236_379.txt|The seller was not revealed.
p236_380.txt|People are on the alert.
p236_381.txt|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_382.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p236_383.txt|A review is under way.
p236_384.txt|They know it'll be fantastic.
p236_385.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236_386.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p236_387.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p236_388.txt|It brought in new management.
p236_389.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p236_390.txt|She is in their hands.
p236_391.txt|The following day I used the story.
p236_392.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236_393.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p236_394.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p236_395.txt|I should think so, too.
p236_396.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p236_397.txt|How are you, sir ?
p236_398.txt|So is that it, then ?
p236_399.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p236_400.txt|It certainly appeared that way.
p236_401.txt|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p236_402.txt|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236_403.txt|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_404.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p236_405.txt|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p236_406.txt|It had been on the cards.
p236_407.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p236_408.txt|The trick is to try it.
p236_409.txt|I would love to think that she could win.
p236_410.txt|He may have a point.
p236_411.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236_412.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236_413.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p236_414.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p236_415.txt|I've got my own ideas.
p236_416.txt|I never had a childhood.
p236_417.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236_418.txt|I think it's a miracle.
p236_419.txt|They were not complacent in any way.
p236_420.txt|They did the right thing.
p236_421.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p236_422.txt|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_423.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p236_424.txt|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_425.txt|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236_426.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p236_427.txt|It is a case of pity for us.
p236_428.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p236_429.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p236_430.txt|We've got a good management record.
p236_431.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p236_432.txt|Paris is not only young.
p236_433.txt|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_434.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p236_435.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p236_436.txt|It looked like a war zone.
p236_437.txt|He said current trading was strong.
p236_438.txt|I chose to make a film.
p236_439.txt|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236_440.txt|But by that time, it was too late.
p236_441.txt|The damage is all inside.
p236_442.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p236_443.txt|We would have concerns about that.
p236_444.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p236_445.txt|Taxes may need to rise.
p236_446.txt|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236_447.txt|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p236_448.txt|No options are excluded at all.
p236_449.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p236_450.txt|We are going for it.
p236_451.txt|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_452.txt|It is a cause for concern.
p236_453.txt|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236_454.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p236_455.txt|He deserved a red card.
p236_456.txt|They were not even allowed to see them.
p236_457.txt|And she is very clear on this.
p236_458.txt|And it covers the spectrum.
p236_459.txt|Dennis was not so sure.
p236_460.txt|The chief constable has retired.
p236_461.txt|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236_462.txt|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236_463.txt|Not if you know the person.
p236_464.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236_465.txt|I was all image and no substance.
p236_466.txt|The boys are mentally focused.
p236_467.txt|It can all be done over the phone.
p236_468.txt|The bill would be massive.
p236_469.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p236_470.txt|Neither woman has been named.
p236_471.txt|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236_472.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p236_473.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p236_474.txt|He was a shooting star.
p236_475.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p236_476.txt|I am a committed European.
p236_477.txt|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_478.txt|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236_479.txt|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236_480.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p236_481.txt|He will be advised by me.
p236_482.txt|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236_483.txt|We had to add value.
p236_484.txt|That is the bottom line.
p236_485.txt|It happens on an annual basis.
p236_486.txt|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_487.txt|We have to go for a win.
p236_488.txt|It worked well in Monaco.
p236_489.txt|Something has got to change.
p236_490.txt|I had it before the final.
p236_491.txt|Our fans have been marvellous.
p236_492.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p236_493.txt|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p236_494.txt|It was still there, but right at the end.
p236_495.txt|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236_496.txt|They never gave up hope.
p236_497.txt|He had planned to sell it.
p236_498.txt|I was ready for this.
p236_499.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p236_500.txt|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236_501.txt|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236_502.txt|I stayed away from the defence.
p236_503.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p237_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p237_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p237_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p237_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p237_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p237_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p237_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p237_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p237_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p237_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p237_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p237_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p237_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p237_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p237_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p237_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p237_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p237_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p237_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p237_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p237_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p237_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p237_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p237_025.txt|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p237_026.txt|They should be so lucky.
p237_027.txt|I have a theory.
p237_028.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p237_029.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p237_030.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p237_031.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p237_032.txt|There's a story, too.
p237_033.txt|This is the window.
p237_034.txt|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p237_035.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p237_036.txt|They're just different.
p237_037.txt|It was clear.
p237_038.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p237_039.txt|The problem is the pitch.
p237_040.txt|It's a great thing.
p237_041.txt|He did not know his daughter.
p237_042.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p237_043.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p237_044.txt|It's the only thing.
p237_045.txt|It is so sad.
p237_046.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p237_047.txt|It is urgent.
p237_048.txt|I feel pretty good.
p237_049.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237_050.txt|It is bizarre.
p237_051.txt|That should do it.
p237_052.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p237_053.txt|She looked so young.
p237_054.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p237_055.txt|Life is good.
p237_056.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p237_057.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p237_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p237_059.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p237_060.txt|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p237_061.txt|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p237_062.txt|None has ever been found.
p237_063.txt|It's a real challenge.
p237_064.txt|You do not change overnight.
p237_065.txt|Art is extra.
p237_066.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237_067.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p237_068.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p237_069.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p237_070.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p237_071.txt|Try to save us.
p237_072.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p237_073.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p237_074.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p237_075.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p237_076.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p237_077.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p237_078.txt|It is a terrible place.
p237_079.txt|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p237_080.txt|It may well have been.
p237_081.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p237_082.txt|I first met him last summer.
p237_083.txt|He is driven.
p237_084.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p237_085.txt|Someone who cares
p237_086.txt|It's never too late.
p237_087.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p237_088.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p237_089.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p237_090.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p237_091.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p237_092.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p237_093.txt|We must look forward.
p237_094.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p237_095.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p237_096.txt|We could not get any possession.
p237_097.txt|I love the Dome.
p237_098.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p237_099.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p237_100.txt|They were outside the circle.
p237_101.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p237_102.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p237_103.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p237_104.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p237_105.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p237_106.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p237_107.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p237_108.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p237_109.txt|It is normal.
p237_110.txt|Further protests are likely.
p237_111.txt|It's in his blood.
p237_112.txt|Who would be right ?
p237_113.txt|It's a shame.
p237_114.txt|I came to complete.
p237_117.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p237_118.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p237_119.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p237_120.txt|Does this mean.
p237_121.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p237_122.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p237_123.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p237_124.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p237_125.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p237_126.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p237_127.txt|I'm so angry.
p237_128.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p237_129.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p237_130.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p237_131.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p237_132.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p237_133.txt|Who will attend ?
p237_134.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p237_135.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p237_136.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p237_137.txt|It's perfectly feasible.
p237_138.txt|They took a risk.
p237_139.txt|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p237_140.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p237_141.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p237_142.txt|He has the edge.
p237_143.txt|Three penalties were given.
p237_144.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p237_145.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p237_146.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p237_147.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p237_148.txt|He is severe.
p237_149.txt|She died at her home.
p237_150.txt|Is that Titanic ?
p237_151.txt|The idea is simple.
p237_153.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p237_154.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p237_155.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p237_156.txt|It is huge.
p237_157.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p237_159.txt|It is not normal practice.
p237_160.txt|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p237_161.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p237_162.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p237_163.txt|We are now up against it.
p237_164.txt|I was in daily contact.
p237_165.txt|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p237_166.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p237_167.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p237_168.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p237_169.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p237_170.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p237_171.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p237_172.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p237_173.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p237_174.txt|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p237_175.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p237_176.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p237_177.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p237_178.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p237_179.txt|He was a crazy man.
p237_180.txt|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p237_181.txt|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p237_182.txt|One season, they might do well.
p237_183.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p237_184.txt|This is a sad day.
p237_185.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p237_186.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p237_187.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p237_188.txt|Government will intervene.
p237_189.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p237_190.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p237_191.txt|It's a joke.
p237_192.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p237_193.txt|I wish I could say something.
p237_194.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p237_195.txt|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p237_196.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p237_198.txt|If the director is with you.
p237_199.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p237_200.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p237_201.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p237_202.txt|Our strategy is straightforward.
p237_203.txt|Is that success ?
p237_204.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p237_205.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p237_206.txt|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p237_207.txt|He was also married with two children.
p237_208.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p237_210.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p237_211.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p237_212.txt|I don't want to use it.
p237_213.txt|Now, it's all right.
p237_214.txt|There was an e-mail.
p237_215.txt|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p237_216.txt|It is a gamble.
p237_217.txt|He is slightly confused.
p237_218.txt|She should not be blamed.
p237_219.txt|I began to pray.
p237_220.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p237_221.txt|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p237_222.txt|By hard work, is the answer.
p237_223.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p237_224.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p237_225.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p237_226.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p237_227.txt|You have to do your research.
p237_228.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p237_229.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p237_230.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p237_231.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p237_232.txt|I am immensely sad.
p237_233.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p237_234.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p237_235.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p237_236.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237_237.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p237_238.txt|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p237_239.txt|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p237_240.txt|You take a risk.
p237_241.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p237_242.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p237_243.txt|It's a dead end.
p237_244.txt|We are in the hat.
p237_245.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p237_246.txt|They should come forward.
p237_247.txt|It is not the message alone.
p237_248.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p237_249.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p237_250.txt|It's quite a line-up !
p237_251.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p237_252.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p237_253.txt|We were extremely poor.
p237_254.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p237_255.txt|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p237_256.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p237_257.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p237_258.txt|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
p237_259.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p237_260.txt|Our decision making was poor.
p237_262.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p237_263.txt|They are different types.
p237_264.txt|There's the mix.
p237_265.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p237_266.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p237_267.txt|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p237_268.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p237_270.txt|Special measures were needed.
p237_271.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p237_272.txt|This is a big club.
p237_273.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p237_274.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p237_275.txt|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p237_276.txt|It is also very valuable.
p237_277.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p237_278.txt|The warning is timely.
p237_279.txt|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p237_280.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p237_281.txt|There is no link.
p237_282.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p237_283.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p237_284.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p237_285.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p237_286.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p237_287.txt|We're in shock.
p237_288.txt|You know the type.
p237_289.txt|She failed in her action.
p237_290.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p237_291.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p237_292.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p237_293.txt|People have no choice.
p237_294.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p237_295.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p237_296.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p237_297.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p237_298.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p237_299.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p237_300.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p237_301.txt|That could change.
p237_302.txt|He should have won.
p237_303.txt|Who can predict ?
p237_304.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p237_305.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p237_306.txt|I was the sheep.
p237_307.txt|Graeme was prepared.
p237_308.txt|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p237_309.txt|It is a road of death.
p237_310.txt|This is a war over our home.
p237_311.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p237_312.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p237_313.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p237_314.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p237_315.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p237_316.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p237_317.txt|It is no surprise.
p237_318.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p237_320.txt|They were fantastic.
p237_321.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p237_322.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p237_323.txt|It should be equal.
p237_325.txt|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p237_326.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p237_327.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p237_328.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p237_329.txt|I am so upset.
p237_330.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p237_331.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p237_332.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p237_333.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p237_334.txt|I saw some good things.
p237_335.txt|He can do no wrong.
p237_337.txt|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p237_338.txt|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237_339.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p237_340.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p237_341.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p237_342.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p237_343.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p237_344.txt|The train was on time.
p237_345.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p237_346.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p237_347.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p237_348.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p237_349.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p237_350.txt|The composer will conduct.
p237_351.txt|It should be scrapped.
p238_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p238_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p238_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p238_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p238_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p238_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p238_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p238_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p238_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p238_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p238_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p238_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p238_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p238_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p238_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p238_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p238_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p238_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p238_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p238_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p238_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p238_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p238_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p238_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p238_025.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p238_026.txt|The first appeared to be successful.
p238_027.txt|We must convince the citizens.
p238_028.txt|There was a rush of water.
p238_029.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p238_030.txt|Further management changes are planned.
p238_031.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p238_032.txt|The staff are very good.
p238_033.txt|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p238_034.txt|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p238_035.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p238_036.txt|Let there be no doubt about that.
p238_037.txt|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p238_038.txt|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p238_039.txt|And so was a photograph.
p238_040.txt|I remember that day well.
p238_041.txt|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p238_042.txt|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p238_043.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p238_044.txt|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238_045.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p238_046.txt|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238_047.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238_048.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p238_049.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p238_050.txt|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p238_051.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p238_052.txt|He is too weak to move.
p238_053.txt|Does it matter ?
p238_054.txt|How do you take them away ?
p238_055.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p238_056.txt|After the match, do you ?
p238_057.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p238_058.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p238_059.txt|They desperately want some stability.
p238_060.txt|Well, he is an artist.
p238_061.txt|We work for the athlete.
p238_062.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p238_063.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p238_064.txt|He will need that machine.
p238_065.txt|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238_066.txt|It's the performance we want.
p238_067.txt|Then they scored two goals to win.
p238_068.txt|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p238_069.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p238_070.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p238_071.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p238_072.txt|I had relied on him.
p238_073.txt|And then there's the racial hassle.
p238_074.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p238_075.txt|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p238_076.txt|I am relishing the challenge.
p238_077.txt|I have made that offer.
p238_078.txt|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p238_079.txt|But the organisers refused to worry.
p238_080.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p238_081.txt|We should be able to cope.
p238_082.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238_083.txt|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238_084.txt|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p238_085.txt|It is somewhere to be.
p238_086.txt|We should all be grateful.
p238_087.txt|We will pay their bills.
p238_088.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p238_089.txt|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238_090.txt|He thought she was amazing.
p238_091.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p238_092.txt|Final proposals will be published in February.
p238_093.txt|He seems to have everything.
p238_094.txt|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p238_095.txt|It wasn't possible to relax.
p238_096.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p238_097.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p238_098.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p238_099.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p238_100.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p238_101.txt|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238_102.txt|It's very dangerous for markets.
p238_103.txt|The fans would love it.
p238_104.txt|That would be the case with Dundee.
p238_105.txt|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p238_106.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p238_107.txt|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p238_108.txt|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p238_109.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238_110.txt|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p238_111.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p238_112.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p238_113.txt|Those people must be accountable.
p238_114.txt|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p238_115.txt|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p238_116.txt|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p238_117.txt|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p238_118.txt|It's going to be epic.
p238_119.txt|What form did that take ?
p238_120.txt|Are they free ?
p238_121.txt|What are they for ?
p238_122.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p238_123.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p238_124.txt|So what happens next ?
p238_125.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p238_126.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p238_127.txt|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p238_128.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p238_129.txt|They lived for their children.
p238_130.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p238_131.txt|This is a sizeable part of our business.
p238_132.txt|Diversions were put in place.
p238_133.txt|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
p238_134.txt|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p238_135.txt|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p238_136.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p238_137.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p238_138.txt|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p238_139.txt|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p238_140.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p238_141.txt|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p238_142.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p238_143.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p238_144.txt|All the employees are redundant.
p238_145.txt|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
p238_146.txt|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p238_147.txt|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p238_148.txt|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p238_149.txt|And they all have a vote.
p238_150.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p238_151.txt|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p238_152.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p238_154.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p238_155.txt|That's what happened against Ayr.
p238_156.txt|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p238_157.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p238_158.txt|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p238_159.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p238_160.txt|His job was not advertised.
p238_161.txt|He was just like a godfather to it.
p238_162.txt|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p238_163.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p238_164.txt|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p238_165.txt|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p238_166.txt|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p238_167.txt|We can't get over it.
p238_168.txt|They almost achieved a draw.
p238_169.txt|I can see it now.
p238_170.txt|This is a step backwards.
p238_171.txt|I've no idea how it works.
p238_172.txt|We continue to hold the shares.
p238_173.txt|The festivals will be about having fun.
p238_174.txt|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p238_175.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p238_176.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p238_177.txt|The changes took effect from June.
p238_178.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p238_179.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p238_180.txt|Since then, things have improved.
p238_181.txt|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
p238_182.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p238_183.txt|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p238_184.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p238_185.txt|But we could only help a handful of people.
p238_186.txt|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238_187.txt|This is a frightening development.
p238_188.txt|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
p238_189.txt|This should begin in October.
p238_190.txt|You just have to accept.
p238_191.txt|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p238_192.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p238_193.txt|The squad is too small.
p238_194.txt|He has had success at every level.
p238_195.txt|This Patton will also return.
p238_196.txt|Tiger is not the norm.
p238_197.txt|His words were not audible.
p238_198.txt|You are a gambling man.
p238_199.txt|Did he trip ?
p238_200.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p238_201.txt|Did it work ?
p238_202.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p238_203.txt|Is our children learning ?
p238_204.txt|How independent is that ?
p238_206.txt|Truth is the child of time.
p238_207.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p238_208.txt|The refund is fully justified.
p238_209.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p238_211.txt|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p238_212.txt|It is time for confession.
p238_213.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p238_214.txt|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238_215.txt|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p238_216.txt|It was started almost by accident.
p238_217.txt|I will not take part in Edmonton.
p238_218.txt|We will try to find someone.
p238_219.txt|Bottling is now the core business.
p238_220.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p238_221.txt|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238_222.txt|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p238_223.txt|We were right to be afraid.
p238_224.txt|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238_225.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p238_226.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p238_227.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p238_228.txt|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238_229.txt|That view has not altered.
p238_230.txt|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
p238_231.txt|So I got a blood test.
p238_232.txt|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p238_233.txt|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p238_234.txt|There's always the next century.
p238_235.txt|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p238_236.txt|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238_237.txt|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
p238_238.txt|Five years later, the deception continued.
p238_239.txt|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p238_240.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p238_241.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p238_242.txt|It is not normal practice.
p238_243.txt|It is crucial for both teams.
p238_244.txt|Mr Blair had done well.
p238_245.txt|I was a lucky man tonight.
p238_246.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p238_247.txt|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p238_248.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p238_249.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p238_250.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p238_251.txt|And they were being paid ?
p238_252.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p238_253.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p238_254.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p238_255.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p238_256.txt|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p238_257.txt|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p238_258.txt|This is absolutely not true.
p238_259.txt|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238_260.txt|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p238_261.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p238_262.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p238_263.txt|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p238_264.txt|It is a terrible tragedy.
p238_265.txt|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p238_266.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238_267.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p238_268.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p238_269.txt|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p238_270.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p238_271.txt|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p238_272.txt|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p238_273.txt|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p238_274.txt|He is a right bastard.
p238_275.txt|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p238_276.txt|They could not match it.
p238_277.txt|He is not a pathetic figure.
p238_278.txt|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p238_279.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p238_280.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p238_281.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p238_282.txt|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p238_283.txt|Phase one was a shambles.
p238_284.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p238_285.txt|But I was glad to see these interviews.
p238_286.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p238_287.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p238_288.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p238_289.txt|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
p238_290.txt|We've just had it confirmed.
p238_291.txt|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p238_292.txt|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p238_293.txt|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p238_294.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p238_295.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p238_296.txt|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p238_297.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p238_298.txt|They will probably come back.
p238_299.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p238_300.txt|Does the name matter ?
p238_301.txt|how do you get it back ?
p238_302.txt|What are you not good at ?
p238_303.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p238_304.txt|Who was she ?
p238_305.txt|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p238_306.txt|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238_307.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p238_308.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238_309.txt|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p238_310.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p238_311.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p238_312.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p238_313.txt|Movie stars are public property.
p238_314.txt|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p238_315.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p238_316.txt|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p238_317.txt|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p238_318.txt|Sadly, it does not end there.
p238_319.txt|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p238_320.txt|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p238_321.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p238_322.txt|And we have the experience.
p238_323.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p238_324.txt|Celtic were the losers then.
p238_325.txt|Their conclusions were never published.
p238_326.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p238_327.txt|Little is known about them.
p238_328.txt|Margins are also in retreat.
p238_329.txt|Golf is not like that.
p238_330.txt|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p238_331.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p238_332.txt|Which isn't a bad idea.
p238_333.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p238_334.txt|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238_335.txt|He was admitted to hospital.
p238_336.txt|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238_337.txt|Abbey National is an option.
p238_338.txt|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238_339.txt|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p238_340.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p238_341.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p238_342.txt|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
p238_343.txt|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238_344.txt|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p238_345.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p238_346.txt|His third goal was superb.
p238_347.txt|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p238_349.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p238_350.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p238_351.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p238_352.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p238_353.txt|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p238_354.txt|They're going to open in early summer.
p238_355.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p238_356.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p238_357.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p238_358.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p238_359.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p238_360.txt|I saw them last week.
p238_361.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p238_362.txt|It was a good workout.
p238_363.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p238_364.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p238_365.txt|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p238_366.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p238_368.txt|We can have no complaints.
p238_369.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p238_370.txt|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
p238_371.txt|We will likely look for new investors.
p238_372.txt|But the rally was short-lived.
p238_373.txt|But you never won any games.
p238_374.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p238_375.txt|And he goes with it.
p238_376.txt|I have little time for analysts.
p238_377.txt|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p238_378.txt|It was really quite amazing.
p238_379.txt|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238_380.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p238_381.txt|It was cynical and callous.
p238_382.txt|He did not say that.
p238_383.txt|So is that it, then ?
p238_384.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p238_385.txt|What do we do ?
p238_386.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p238_387.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p238_388.txt|His successor was only appointed last month.
p238_389.txt|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238_390.txt|It's difficult to put a date on.
p238_391.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p238_392.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p238_393.txt|You will have seen the adverts.
p238_394.txt|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p238_395.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p238_396.txt|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p238_397.txt|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238_398.txt|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238_399.txt|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238_400.txt|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p238_401.txt|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238_402.txt|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238_403.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p238_404.txt|Everything has its place and purpose.
p238_405.txt|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p238_406.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p238_407.txt|And it had two seats.
p238_408.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p238_409.txt|How are you, sir ?
p238_410.txt|But nothing could be done.
p238_411.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p238_412.txt|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p238_413.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p238_414.txt|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p238_415.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p238_416.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p238_417.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p238_418.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p238_419.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p238_420.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p238_421.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p238_422.txt|The company declined to comment.
p238_423.txt|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238_424.txt|Got to get my sunglasses.
p238_425.txt|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p238_426.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p238_427.txt|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p238_428.txt|Messages have to be reinforced.
p238_429.txt|Not many people like to do that.
p238_430.txt|We accept the new rules.
p238_431.txt|We go there with confidence.
p238_432.txt|It was like the old days.
p238_433.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p238_434.txt|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p238_435.txt|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p238_436.txt|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p238_437.txt|We are aiming for early March.
p238_438.txt|We discovered that for ourselves.
p238_439.txt|It is also very valuable.
p238_440.txt|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p238_441.txt|None of this work is guaranteed.
p238_442.txt|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p238_443.txt|Still, some additions are inspired.
p238_444.txt|I believe we can handle this okay.
p238_445.txt|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238_446.txt|Hard cash is needed now.
p238_447.txt|I stayed away from the defence.
p238_448.txt|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
p238_449.txt|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p238_450.txt|Either way, it's very funny.
p238_451.txt|It has become a way of life.
p238_452.txt|We didn't want any trouble.
p238_453.txt|It seemed a logical expansion.
p238_454.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p238_455.txt|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p238_456.txt|Now it has doubled in size.
p238_458.txt|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
p238_459.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p238_460.txt|It is business as usual.
p239_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p239_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p239_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p239_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p239_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p239_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p239_025.txt|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p239_026.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p239_027.txt|And so was a photograph.
p239_028.txt|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239_029.txt|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239_030.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p239_031.txt|There was a rush of water.
p239_032.txt|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239_033.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p239_034.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239_035.txt|I might well have done so already.
p239_036.txt|That can cost him a fortune.
p239_037.txt|He works at the airport.
p239_038.txt|How do you take them away ?
p239_039.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p239_040.txt|After the match, do you ?
p239_041.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p239_042.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p239_043.txt|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239_044.txt|It carried a double message.
p239_045.txt|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239_046.txt|But not a penny has been paid.
p239_047.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p239_048.txt|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p239_049.txt|We must learn to finish.
p239_050.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239_051.txt|New York is my home.
p239_052.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239_053.txt|I remember that day well.
p239_054.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p239_055.txt|He is too weak to move.
p239_056.txt|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239_057.txt|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239_058.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p239_059.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p239_060.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p239_061.txt|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239_062.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p239_063.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239_064.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p239_065.txt|They desperately want some stability.
p239_066.txt|Everything is possible in football.
p239_067.txt|Everyone could see the joke.
p239_068.txt|I'm pleased with the horse.
p239_069.txt|He will need that machine.
p239_070.txt|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239_071.txt|Then they scored two goals to win.
p239_072.txt|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p239_073.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239_074.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p239_075.txt|Let's not be too despondent.
p239_076.txt|The Government does not go far enough.
p239_077.txt|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p239_078.txt|I haven't got there yet.
p239_079.txt|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239_080.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p239_081.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p239_082.txt|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239_083.txt|But the organisers refused to worry.
p239_084.txt|And it had two seats.
p239_085.txt|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p239_086.txt|Or so the theory goes.
p239_087.txt|He has really done well.
p239_088.txt|So what happens next ?
p239_089.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p239_090.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p239_091.txt|Is it worth it ?
p239_092.txt|Does it matter ?
p239_093.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239_094.txt|But I had never been in a theatre.
p239_095.txt|It was fun, but not a living.
p239_096.txt|Kenny Miller might come through.
p239_097.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p239_098.txt|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239_099.txt|We will pay their bills.
p239_100.txt|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239_101.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p239_102.txt|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239_103.txt|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239_104.txt|I am so proud of him.
p239_105.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p239_106.txt|He will be kept informed.
p239_107.txt|There could be a way back.
p239_108.txt|He was a lovely man.
p239_109.txt|People will have to be patient.
p239_110.txt|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239_111.txt|Instead, another depression came in.
p239_112.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239_113.txt|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p239_114.txt|It is sometimes like that.
p239_115.txt|The partners are looking for answers.
p239_116.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p239_117.txt|Those people must be accountable.
p239_118.txt|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239_119.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p239_120.txt|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p239_121.txt|The error appeared in a warrant.
p239_122.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p239_123.txt|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239_124.txt|He was just a journalist.
p239_125.txt|They lived for their children.
p239_126.txt|Their season has been consigned to history.
p239_127.txt|Diversions were put in place.
p239_128.txt|How independent is that ?
p239_129.txt|What form did that take ?
p239_130.txt|Are they free ?
p239_131.txt|What are they for ?
p239_132.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p239_133.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p239_134.txt|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239_135.txt|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239_136.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239_137.txt|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p239_138.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p239_139.txt|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239_140.txt|So it was at Easter Road.
p239_141.txt|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239_142.txt|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p239_143.txt|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239_144.txt|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239_145.txt|We just have to adapt.
p239_146.txt|He was forced to quit.
p239_147.txt|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p239_148.txt|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239_149.txt|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239_150.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239_151.txt|Which isn't a bad idea.
p239_152.txt|Since then, things have improved.
p239_153.txt|That's what happened against Ayr.
p239_154.txt|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p239_155.txt|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239_156.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p239_157.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p239_158.txt|Our relationship has been very good.
p239_159.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p239_160.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p239_161.txt|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239_162.txt|I think the referee was good.
p239_163.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p239_164.txt|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p239_165.txt|This was a unique election.
p239_166.txt|They exist in name alone.
p239_167.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p239_168.txt|I can see it now.
p239_169.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239_170.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p239_171.txt|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239_172.txt|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p239_173.txt|She is in good spirits.
p239_174.txt|As if that is an achievement.
p239_175.txt|Mr Blair should be warned.
p239_176.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239_177.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p239_178.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p239_179.txt|Did he trip ?
p239_180.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p239_181.txt|Did it work ?
p239_182.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_183.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p239_184.txt|Structural changes were also required.
p239_185.txt|His job was not advertised.
p239_186.txt|That was just one night.
p239_187.txt|This is a frightening development.
p239_188.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239_189.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p239_190.txt|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239_191.txt|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239_192.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p239_193.txt|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239_194.txt|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239_195.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p239_196.txt|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239_197.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p239_198.txt|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239_199.txt|Tiger is not the norm.
p239_200.txt|It's been a humbling year.
p239_201.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p239_202.txt|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239_203.txt|It is all to do with the coaching.
p239_204.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p239_205.txt|The refund is fully justified.
p239_206.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p239_207.txt|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239_208.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p239_209.txt|He is a very talented player.
p239_210.txt|Bottling is now the core business.
p239_211.txt|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239_212.txt|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p239_213.txt|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239_214.txt|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239_215.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p239_216.txt|We had to add value.
p239_217.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239_218.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p239_219.txt|So I got a blood test.
p239_220.txt|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239_221.txt|I was caught out a little bit.
p239_222.txt|There's always the next century.
p239_223.txt|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p239_224.txt|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239_225.txt|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239_226.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p239_227.txt|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239_228.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p239_229.txt|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239_230.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239_231.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p239_232.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p239_233.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p239_234.txt|We will turn the corner.
p239_235.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p239_236.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p239_237.txt|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239_238.txt|Further details are expected later.
p239_239.txt|This is absolutely not true.
p239_240.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p239_241.txt|These days are long gone.
p239_242.txt|And they were being paid ?
p239_243.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p239_244.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p239_245.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p239_246.txt|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239_247.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p239_248.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p239_249.txt|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239_250.txt|I've come here for the jersey.
p239_251.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239_252.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p239_253.txt|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239_254.txt|She replied, It could be.
p239_255.txt|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239_256.txt|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p239_257.txt|We have a budget in March.
p239_258.txt|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p239_259.txt|We have expanded too quickly.
p239_260.txt|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239_261.txt|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239_262.txt|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239_263.txt|Our position remains the same.
p239_264.txt|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239_265.txt|They could not match it.
p239_266.txt|He is not a pathetic figure.
p239_267.txt|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239_268.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p239_269.txt|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239_270.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239_271.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p239_272.txt|A winter of discontent awaits.
p239_273.txt|I thought we were fantastic.
p239_274.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239_275.txt|It's going to be very closely watched.
p239_276.txt|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239_277.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p239_278.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p239_279.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p239_280.txt|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239_281.txt|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239_282.txt|There is no internal damage.
p239_283.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p239_284.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239_285.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p239_286.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p239_287.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p239_288.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239_289.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p239_290.txt|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p239_291.txt|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p239_292.txt|They will probably come back.
p239_293.txt|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239_294.txt|I saw them last week.
p239_295.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p239_296.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239_297.txt|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239_298.txt|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239_299.txt|Everyone can have their opinion.
p239_300.txt|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239_301.txt|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239_302.txt|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239_303.txt|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p239_304.txt|That should give me a chance.
p239_305.txt|They have played their part.
p239_306.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p239_307.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p239_308.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239_309.txt|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p239_310.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p239_311.txt|Celtic were the losers then.
p239_312.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p239_313.txt|Does the name matter ?
p239_314.txt|how do you get it back ?
p239_315.txt|What are you not good at ?
p239_316.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p239_317.txt|Who was she ?
p239_318.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p239_319.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p239_320.txt|I have been very nervous.
p239_321.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239_322.txt|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239_323.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p239_324.txt|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p239_325.txt|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p239_326.txt|They are looking at a flotation.
p239_327.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p239_328.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p239_329.txt|He was admitted to hospital.
p239_330.txt|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p239_331.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239_332.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p239_333.txt|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p239_334.txt|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239_335.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p239_336.txt|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p239_337.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p239_338.txt|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p239_339.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p239_340.txt|It will affect their work.
p239_341.txt|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p239_342.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p239_343.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p239_344.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p239_345.txt|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239_346.txt|I just felt that I was broken down.
p239_347.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p239_348.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p239_349.txt|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p239_350.txt|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239_351.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p239_352.txt|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p239_353.txt|What happened in that game ?
p239_354.txt|Are you going to win ?
p239_355.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p239_356.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p239_357.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p239_358.txt|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p239_359.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p239_360.txt|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p239_361.txt|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p239_362.txt|Walker plans to return indoors.
p239_363.txt|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239_364.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p239_365.txt|The scientific debate is dead.
p239_366.txt|This would include the GM food industry.
p239_367.txt|But the rally was short-lived.
p239_368.txt|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p239_369.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p239_370.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p239_371.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p239_372.txt|That took about two years.
p239_373.txt|He is obviously very dangerous.
p239_374.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p239_375.txt|This should come as no surprise.
p239_376.txt|It was launched in February last year.
p239_377.txt|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239_378.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p239_379.txt|He did not say that.
p239_380.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p239_381.txt|We have not been approached.
p239_382.txt|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239_383.txt|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p239_384.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p239_385.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p239_386.txt|Well, that's just a third district.
p239_387.txt|She asked for the appointment with me.
p239_388.txt|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p239_389.txt|A new school will be built.
p239_390.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p239_391.txt|How are you, sir ?
p239_392.txt|So is that it, then ?
p239_393.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p239_394.txt|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p239_395.txt|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p239_396.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p239_397.txt|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239_398.txt|We were beaten by the better team.
p239_399.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p239_400.txt|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239_401.txt|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239_402.txt|I have received no explanation.

p239_407.txt|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p239_408.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p239_409.txt|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p239_410.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p239_411.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p239_412.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p239_413.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p239_414.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p239_415.txt|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p239_416.txt|You're not getting any goodwill.
p239_417.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p239_418.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p239_419.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p239_420.txt|I should think so, too.
p239_421.txt|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p239_422.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p239_423.txt|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p239_424.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p239_425.txt|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p239_426.txt|It certainly feels that way.
p239_427.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p239_428.txt|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239_429.txt|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239_430.txt|We accept the new rules.
p239_431.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p239_432.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p239_433.txt|He was released after treatment.
p239_434.txt|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239_435.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p239_436.txt|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p239_437.txt|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239_438.txt|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p239_439.txt|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239_440.txt|It is also very valuable.
p239_441.txt|The stage was set for a showdown.
p239_442.txt|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p239_443.txt|They should not feel under threat.
p239_444.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p239_445.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p239_446.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p239_447.txt|Hard cash is needed now.
p239_448.txt|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239_449.txt|Blair also had a penalty.
p239_450.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p239_451.txt|Either way, it's very funny.
p239_452.txt|We didn't want any trouble.
p239_453.txt|It seemed a logical expansion.
p239_454.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p239_455.txt|And Michael was just great.
p239_456.txt|Now it has doubled in size.
p239_457.txt|It was never a free kick.
p239_458.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p239_459.txt|This is a great opportunity for us.
p239_460.txt|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239_461.txt|Inventories are coming under control.
p239_462.txt|She failed in her action.
p239_463.txt|We will provide immediate access.
p239_464.txt|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239_465.txt|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p239_466.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p239_467.txt|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239_468.txt|The money is within the total allocation.
p239_469.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p239_470.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p239_471.txt|There's nothing I can say.
p239_472.txt|We need a visionary producer.
p239_473.txt|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p239_474.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p239_475.txt|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239_476.txt|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239_477.txt|We did something about it.
p239_478.txt|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p239_479.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p239_480.txt|Five years later, the deception continued.
p239_481.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p239_482.txt|The death toll included five children.
p239_483.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p239_484.txt|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239_485.txt|I was there five months ago.
p239_486.txt|It happened again, and again, and again.
p239_487.txt|It could well be military.
p239_488.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p239_489.txt|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239_490.txt|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239_491.txt|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p239_492.txt|MOVIE stars are public property.
p239_493.txt|I first met him last summer.
p239_494.txt|The songs are just so good.
p239_495.txt|The whole thing was just unreal.
p239_496.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p239_497.txt|They haven't been thought through.
p239_498.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p239_499.txt|I am not unduly surprised.
p239_500.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p239_501.txt|You are a different people.
p239_502.txt|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p239_503.txt|The world record is suspicious.
p240_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p240_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p240_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p240_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p240_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p240_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p240_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p240_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p240_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p240_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p240_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p240_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p240_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p240_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p240_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p240_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p240_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p240_018.txt|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p240_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p240_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p240_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p240_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p240_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p240_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p240_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p240_026.txt|But it failed.
p240_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p240_028.txt|Is this accurate?
p240_029.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p240_030.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p240_031.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p240_032.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p240_033.txt|This is the window.
p240_034.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p240_035.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p240_036.txt|It is marvellous.
p240_037.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p240_038.txt|It has failed.
p240_039.txt|They're just different.
p240_040.txt|It's a real threat.
p240_041.txt|It was the eighties.
p240_042.txt|Indeed, he does.
p240_043.txt|President Bush is at war.
p240_044.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p240_045.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p240_046.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p240_047.txt|It is so sad.
p240_048.txt|That period was a struggle.
p240_049.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p240_050.txt|Who can say?
p240_051.txt|It's a blessing.
p240_052.txt|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p240_053.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p240_054.txt|He is too weak to move.
p240_055.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p240_056.txt|He had no enemies.
p240_057.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p240_058.txt|However the drama was still not at an end.
p240_059.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p240_060.txt|That's the truth.
p240_061.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p240_062.txt|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p240_063.txt|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p240_064.txt|Art is extra.
p240_065.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p240_066.txt|They are real.
p240_067.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p240_068.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p240_069.txt|It should be devolved.
p240_070.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p240_071.txt|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p240_072.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p240_073.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p240_074.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p240_075.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p240_076.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p240_077.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p240_078.txt|I've got the shirt.
p240_079.txt|Today she has been released.
p240_080.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p240_081.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p240_082.txt|What has changed?
p240_083.txt|He is in the queue.
p240_084.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p240_085.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p240_086.txt|Someone who cares
p240_087.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p240_088.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p240_089.txt|They lived for their children.
p240_090.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p240_091.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p240_092.txt|She told The Herald.
p240_093.txt|We could not get any possession.
p240_094.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p240_095.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p240_096.txt|They were outside the circle.
p240_097.txt|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
p240_098.txt|It was a good performance.
p240_099.txt|I see no need for change.
p240_100.txt|We have every respect for Michelle.
p240_101.txt|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p240_102.txt|He takes the job.
p240_103.txt|They will want to perform well.
p240_104.txt|That all hope is never lost.
p240_105.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p240_106.txt|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
p240_107.txt|It's in his blood.
p240_108.txt|It's a shame.
p240_109.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p240_110.txt|I came to complete.
p240_111.txt|It's a question of perception.
p240_112.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p240_113.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p240_114.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p240_115.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p240_116.txt|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p240_117.txt|I joined a group.
p240_118.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p240_119.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p240_120.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p240_121.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p240_122.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p240_123.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p240_124.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p240_125.txt|I was furious.
p240_126.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p240_127.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p240_128.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p240_129.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p240_130.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p240_131.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p240_132.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p240_133.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p240_134.txt|It is also well received.
p240_135.txt|Government will intervene.
p240_136.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p240_137.txt|He was in a great deal of pain.
p240_138.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p240_139.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p240_140.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p240_141.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p240_142.txt|Who would be right?
p240_143.txt|She died at her home.
p240_144.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p240_145.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p240_146.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p240_147.txt|They did very well.
p240_148.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p240_149.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p240_150.txt|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p240_151.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p240_152.txt|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p240_153.txt|Mr Blair had done well.
p240_154.txt|I was in daily contact.
p240_155.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p240_156.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p240_157.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p240_158.txt|Was this element always there?
p240_159.txt|These days are long gone.
p240_160.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p240_161.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p240_162.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p240_163.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p240_164.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p240_165.txt|Tell it like it was?
p240_166.txt|We have a budget in March.
p240_167.txt|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p240_168.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p240_169.txt|They will do their own thing.
p240_170.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p240_171.txt|It's quite a routine.
p240_172.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p240_173.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p240_174.txt|I drove the ball well.
p240_175.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p240_176.txt|They know no other way.
p240_177.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p240_178.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p240_179.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p240_180.txt|They will run a mile.
p240_181.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p240_182.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p240_183.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p240_184.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p240_185.txt|We want to help them through it.
p240_186.txt|They really did a great job.
p240_187.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p240_188.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p240_189.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p240_190.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p240_191.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p240_192.txt|People will ask about us.
p240_193.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p240_194.txt|It is a farce.
p240_195.txt|I am totally surprised.
p240_196.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p240_197.txt|It wasn't to be.
p240_198.txt|There was no option.
p240_199.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p240_200.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p240_201.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p240_202.txt|Who will pay for this?
p240_203.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p240_204.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p240_205.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p240_206.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p240_207.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p240_208.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p240_209.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p240_210.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p240_211.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p240_212.txt|She should not be blamed.
p240_213.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p240_214.txt|It had all been arranged.
p240_215.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p240_216.txt|His third goal was superb.
p240_217.txt|I was so nervous.
p240_218.txt|Work has started.
p240_219.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p240_220.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p240_221.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p240_222.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p240_223.txt|That has been the easy part.
p240_224.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p240_225.txt|But it will be sorted out this week.
p240_226.txt|What was the main difference?
p240_227.txt|I am immensely sad.
p240_228.txt|It is a gamble.
p240_229.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p240_230.txt|It's so special.
p240_231.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p240_232.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p240_233.txt|The body follows the mind.
p240_234.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p240_235.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p240_236.txt|Jobs could go.
p240_237.txt|It is not the message alone.
p240_238.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p240_239.txt|It's very safe.
p240_240.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p240_241.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p240_242.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p240_243.txt|We were extremely poor.
p240_244.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p240_245.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p240_246.txt|It is hard won.
p240_247.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p240_248.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p240_249.txt|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
p240_250.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p240_251.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p240_252.txt|He got the same story.
p240_253.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p240_254.txt|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p240_255.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p240_256.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p240_257.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p240_258.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p240_259.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p240_260.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p240_261.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p240_262.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p240_263.txt|I was happily surprised.
p240_264.txt|They must play for each other.
p240_265.txt|It is also very valuable.
p240_266.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p240_267.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p240_268.txt|There is no link.
p240_269.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p240_270.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p240_271.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p240_272.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p240_273.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p240_274.txt|He was also married with two children.
p240_275.txt|And Michael was just great.
p240_276.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p240_277.txt|Access has been a nightmare.
p240_278.txt|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p240_279.txt|It's a way of life.
p240_280.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p240_281.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p240_282.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p240_283.txt|People have no choice.
p240_284.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p240_285.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p240_286.txt|If not, he should go home.
p240_288.txt|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p240_289.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p240_290.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p240_291.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p240_292.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p240_293.txt|It was a virus.
p240_294.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p240_295.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p240_296.txt|It's like a high school play.
p240_297.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p240_298.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p240_299.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p240_300.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p240_301.txt|A new school will be built.
p240_302.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p240_303.txt|He said she was mad.
p240_304.txt|I was the sheep.
p240_305.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p240_306.txt|The home was now under new management.
p240_307.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p240_308.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p240_309.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p240_310.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p240_311.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p240_312.txt|The plot is minimal.
p240_313.txt|And he goes with it.
p240_314.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p240_315.txt|It is no surprise.
p240_316.txt|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p240_317.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p240_318.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p240_319.txt|They were fantastic.
p240_320.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p240_321.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p240_322.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p240_323.txt|Henman has been warned.
p240_324.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p240_325.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p240_326.txt|It is out there.
p240_327.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p240_328.txt|They had a confession.
p240_329.txt|We do the same.
p240_330.txt|That's the law of the land.
p240_331.txt|Donald was his friend.
p240_332.txt|I am so upset.
p240_333.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p240_334.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p240_335.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p240_336.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p240_337.txt|It could have gone either way.
p240_338.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p240_339.txt|I saw some good things.
p240_340.txt|I've not thought about it.
p240_341.txt|Who was the mystery MP?
p240_342.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p240_343.txt|It is a sign of hope.
p240_344.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p240_345.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p240_346.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p240_347.txt|It is so unfair.
p240_348.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p240_349.txt|He has to learn.
p240_351.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p240_352.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p240_353.txt|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p240_354.txt|The composer will conduct.
p240_355.txt|This is a friendly match?
p240_357.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p240_358.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p240_359.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p240_360.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p240_361.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p240_362.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p240_363.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p240_364.txt|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240_365.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p240_366.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p240_367.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p240_368.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p240_369.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p240_370.txt|Hartley should know.
p240_371.txt|That would help.
p240_372.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p240_373.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p240_374.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p240_375.txt|We are looking for perfection.
p240_376.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p240_377.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p240_378.txt|It's been hard.
p240_379.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p240_380.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p241_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p241_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p241_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p241_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p241_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p241_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p241_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p241_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p241_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p241_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p241_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p241_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p241_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p241_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p241_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p241_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p241_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p241_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p241_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p241_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p241_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p241_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p241_026.txt|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p241_027.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p241_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p241_029.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p241_030.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p241_031.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p241_032.txt|This is the window.
p241_033.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p241_034.txt|And we have a singer.
p241_035.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p241_036.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p241_037.txt|It's nice to hear.
p241_038.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p241_039.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p241_040.txt|President Bush is at war.
p241_041.txt|It was ugly.
p241_042.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241_043.txt|That period was a struggle.
p241_044.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p241_045.txt|We need to chat.
p241_046.txt|That time has passed.
p241_047.txt|As she explains.
p241_048.txt|He is too weak to move.
p241_049.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241_050.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p241_051.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p241_052.txt|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p241_053.txt|However the drama was still not at an end.
p241_055.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p241_056.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p241_057.txt|What was the main difference?
p241_058.txt|I was an athlete.
p241_059.txt|There was a battle there.
p241_061.txt|It was all in a short period of time.
p241_062.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p241_063.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p241_064.txt|The script was funny.
p241_065.txt|He could make it.
p241_066.txt|Try to save us.
p241_067.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p241_068.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p241_069.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241_070.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p241_071.txt|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p241_072.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p241_073.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p241_074.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241_075.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p241_076.txt|He is now resident in England.
p241_077.txt|Even the one she loved.
p241_078.txt|I've got the shirt.
p241_079.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p241_080.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p241_081.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p241_082.txt|I first met him last summer.
p241_083.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p241_084.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p241_085.txt|Someone who cares
p241_087.txt|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p241_088.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p241_089.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p241_090.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p241_091.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p241_092.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p241_093.txt|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p241_094.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p241_095.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p241_096.txt|The peace process will be buried!
p241_098.txt|I love the Dome.
p241_099.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p241_100.txt|It was mayhem.
p241_101.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p241_102.txt|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p241_103.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p241_104.txt|They will want to perform well.
p241_105.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p241_106.txt|I'm not depressed.
p241_107.txt|It was his job to check.
p241_108.txt|Is that right?
p241_109.txt|You had better believe it.
p241_110.txt|We want to help them through it.
p241_111.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p241_112.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p241_113.txt|It's not fair.
p241_114.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p241_115.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p241_116.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p241_117.txt|I joined a group.
p241_118.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p241_119.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p241_120.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p241_121.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p241_122.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p241_123.txt|I'm so angry.
p241_124.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p241_125.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p241_126.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p241_127.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p241_128.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p241_129.txt|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p241_130.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p241_132.txt|What will happen then?
p241_133.txt|It's not true.
p241_134.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p241_135.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p241_136.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p241_137.txt|It was typical.
p241_138.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p241_139.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p241_140.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p241_141.txt|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p241_142.txt|He is severe.
p241_143.txt|Is that Titanic?
p241_144.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p241_145.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p241_146.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p241_147.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p241_148.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p241_149.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p241_150.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p241_151.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p241_152.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p241_153.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p241_154.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p241_155.txt|Was this element always there?
p241_157.txt|It was so new, so exciting.
p241_158.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p241_159.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p241_160.txt|We do not get that impression now.
p241_161.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p241_162.txt|We have to move forward.
p241_163.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p241_164.txt|We have a budget in March.
p241_165.txt|There was no respite.
p241_166.txt|They will do their own thing.
p241_167.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p241_168.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p241_169.txt|It is too much for me.
p241_170.txt|He was a crazy man.
p241_171.txt|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p241_172.txt|It became a book by itself.
p241_173.txt|One season, they might do well.
p241_174.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p241_175.txt|And I saw the light!
p241_176.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p241_177.txt|The clarity is vital.
p241_178.txt|I drove the ball well.
p241_179.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p241_180.txt|They know no other way.
p241_181.txt|It is minute.
p241_182.txt|They will run a mile.
p241_183.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p241_184.txt|We did everything by the book.
p241_185.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p241_186.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p241_187.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p241_188.txt|I wish I could say something.
p241_189.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p241_190.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p241_191.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p241_192.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p241_193.txt|Off I went.
p241_195.txt|It's the same old story.
p241_196.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p241_197.txt|Is that success?
p241_198.txt|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p241_199.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p241_200.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p241_202.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p241_203.txt|He's not perfect.
p241_204.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p241_205.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p241_206.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p241_207.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p241_208.txt|I don't want to use it.
p241_209.txt|But I am a worried man.
p241_210.txt|He knows a lot.
p241_211.txt|It had all been arranged.
p241_212.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p241_213.txt|His third goal was superb.
p241_214.txt|It's been a good year.
p241_215.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p241_216.txt|I was so nervous.
p241_217.txt|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p241_218.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p241_219.txt|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p241_220.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p241_221.txt|You have to do your research.
p241_222.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p241_223.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p241_224.txt|But it will be sorted out this week.
p241_225.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p241_226.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p241_227.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p241_228.txt|Who would be right?
p241_229.txt|It is set in Paris.
p241_230.txt|It is not the message alone.
p241_231.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p241_232.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p241_233.txt|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p241_234.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p241_235.txt|We were extremely poor.
p241_236.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p241_237.txt|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p241_238.txt|It is hard won.
p241_239.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241_240.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p241_241.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p241_242.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p241_243.txt|The scene is about this?
p241_244.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p241_245.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p241_246.txt|They are different types.
p241_247.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p241_248.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p241_249.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p241_250.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p241_251.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p241_252.txt|Special measures were needed.
p241_253.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p241_254.txt|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p241_255.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p241_256.txt|They are real.
p241_257.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p241_258.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p241_259.txt|That's the only thing I will say.
p241_260.txt|It was good fun.
p241_261.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p241_262.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p241_264.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p241_265.txt|It's very nice.
p241_266.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p241_267.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p241_268.txt|And Michael was just great.
p241_269.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p241_270.txt|Access has been a nightmare.
p241_271.txt|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p241_272.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p241_273.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p241_274.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p241_275.txt|It's so awful.
p241_276.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p241_277.txt|We are a grandmother.
p241_278.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p241_279.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p241_280.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p241_281.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p241_282.txt|Yet, it worked.
p241_283.txt|I should think so, too.
p241_284.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p241_285.txt|The death toll included five children.
p241_286.txt|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p241_287.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p241_288.txt|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p241_289.txt|It changed my life.
p241_290.txt|A new school will be built.
p241_291.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p241_292.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p241_293.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p241_294.txt|What has altered?
p241_295.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p241_296.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p241_297.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p241_298.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p241_299.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p241_300.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p241_301.txt|This is a war over our home.
p241_302.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p241_303.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p241_304.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p241_305.txt|And he goes with it.
p241_306.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p241_307.txt|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p241_308.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p241_309.txt|Is there on his hands?
p241_310.txt|It was a question of patience.
p241_311.txt|I was rubbish.
p241_312.txt|Kids are terrible.
p241_313.txt|It should be equal.
p241_314.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p241_315.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p241_317.txt|It is out there.
p241_319.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p241_320.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p241_321.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p241_322.txt|It is a strong case.
p241_323.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p241_324.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p241_325.txt|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p241_326.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p241_327.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p241_328.txt|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p241_329.txt|I've not thought about it.
p241_330.txt|Who was the mystery MP?
p241_331.txt|It's been hard.
p241_332.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p241_333.txt|Who will do it?
p241_334.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p241_336.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p241_337.txt|I must make that clear.
p241_338.txt|The train was on time.
p241_340.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p241_342.txt|I would miss him.
p241_343.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p241_344.txt|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p241_345.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p241_346.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p241_347.txt|I got a yellow card.
p241_349.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p241_350.txt|There is a cup final at stake.
p241_351.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p241_352.txt|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p241_353.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p241_354.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p241_356.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p241_357.txt|Our numbers are small.
p241_358.txt|That would help.
p241_359.txt|So I left.
p241_360.txt|We are looking for perfection.
p241_362.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p241_363.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p241_364.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p241_365.txt|The play is based on a real-life event.
p241_366.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p241_368.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p241_369.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p241_370.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p241_371.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p241_372.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p241_373.txt|Talks are progressing.
p241_374.txt|There is no signature.
p243_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p243_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p243_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p243_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p243_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p243_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p243_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p243_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p243_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p243_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p243_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p243_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p243_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p243_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p243_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p243_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p243_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p243_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p243_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p243_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p243_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p243_025.txt|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243_026.txt|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p243_027.txt|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p243_028.txt|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p243_029.txt|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p243_030.txt|She brought a lot to my life.
p243_031.txt|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243_032.txt|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_033.txt|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243_034.txt|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p243_035.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p243_036.txt|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p243_037.txt|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p243_038.txt|He added that her comments were noted.
p243_039.txt|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243_040.txt|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_041.txt|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_042.txt|He does not even trust his own members.
p243_043.txt|He too started on the subs seats.
p243_044.txt|Is it worth it ?
p243_045.txt|Does it matter ?
p243_046.txt|How do you take them away ?
p243_047.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p243_048.txt|After the match, do you ?
p243_049.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p243_050.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p243_051.txt|I'm as fit as I can get.
p243_052.txt|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p243_053.txt|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_054.txt|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243_055.txt|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_056.txt|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_057.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_058.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_059.txt|We just want this season to end.
p243_060.txt|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_061.txt|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_062.txt|The referee is there to decide these things.
p243_063.txt|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243_064.txt|It also has a good labour supply.
p243_065.txt|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_066.txt|Do not give your details to anyone.
p243_067.txt|He was failed by his health authority.
p243_068.txt|But it was not all bad news.
p243_069.txt|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_070.txt|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p243_071.txt|It turned me against the whole system.
p243_072.txt|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_073.txt|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_074.txt|But two groups refused to sign up.
p243_075.txt|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_076.txt|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243_077.txt|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_078.txt|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_079.txt|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243_080.txt|They said our costs were too high.
p243_081.txt|I do not attempt to answer that.
p243_082.txt|It's been a great evening for us.
p243_083.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_084.txt|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243_085.txt|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p243_086.txt|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p243_087.txt|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_088.txt|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_089.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p243_090.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p243_091.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_092.txt|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p243_093.txt|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p243_094.txt|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p243_095.txt|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_096.txt|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243_097.txt|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243_098.txt|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243_099.txt|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243_100.txt|I am delighted to hear this news.
p243_101.txt|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243_102.txt|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243_103.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p243_104.txt|They won't actually make any money from it.
p243_105.txt|I bought a flat six years ago.
p243_106.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243_107.txt|They are a different team at home.
p243_108.txt|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243_109.txt|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243_110.txt|Some young girls also came by last night.
p243_111.txt|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243_112.txt|What are they for ?
p243_113.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p243_114.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115.txt|So what happens next ?
p243_116.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p243_117.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p243_118.txt|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p243_119.txt|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243_120.txt|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243_121.txt|They have no real friends in the region.
p243_122.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243_123.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243_125.txt|I think there's not much between them.
p243_126.txt|So I am going in the right direction.
p243_127.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243_128.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p243_129.txt|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243_130.txt|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p243_131.txt|He's got to look after himself now.
p243_132.txt|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243_133.txt|No country has a similar training programme.
p243_134.txt|There is no future in rock music.
p243_135.txt|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243_136.txt|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p243_137.txt|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243_138.txt|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_139.txt|The programme has been made with great care.
p243_140.txt|There was only one living room, you see.
p243_141.txt|I am not under any new pressure.
p243_142.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p243_143.txt|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243_144.txt|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_145.txt|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243_146.txt|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p243_147.txt|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243_148.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243_149.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p243_150.txt|Did he trip ?
p243_151.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152.txt|Did it work ?
p243_153.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154.txt|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_155.txt|Time may already have run out for this option.
p243_156.txt|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_157.txt|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243_158.txt|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243_159.txt|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243_160.txt|A progress report will be published in October.
p243_161.txt|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p243_162.txt|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p243_163.txt|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_164.txt|Surely it can't run for two years.
p243_165.txt|But the game is still wide open.
p243_166.txt|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p243_167.txt|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p243_168.txt|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_169.txt|We had to work very hard for our points.
p243_170.txt|That is a big risk at any price.
p243_171.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243_172.txt|He said some things which were better left alone.
p243_173.txt|If successful, several records will be made.
p243_174.txt|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243_175.txt|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p243_176.txt|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_177.txt|It's just a different way of life.
p243_178.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243_179.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p243_180.txt|I am secure in my own position.
p243_181.txt|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p243_182.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p243_183.txt|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p243_184.txt|We have come a long way since then.
p243_185.txt|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243_186.txt|A great player has to win major championships.
p243_187.txt|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243_188.txt|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p243_189.txt|The story was not made public by this club.
p243_190.txt|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243_191.txt|You are not long home from work.
p243_192.txt|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243_193.txt|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243_194.txt|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_195.txt|And they were being paid ?
p243_196.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p243_197.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p243_198.txt|But they had to be paid for.
p243_199.txt|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243_200.txt|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243_201.txt|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243_202.txt|I've never had a year like this.
p243_203.txt|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243_204.txt|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243_205.txt|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243_206.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243_207.txt|I want an answer from the British Government.
p243_208.txt|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243_209.txt|They are a victim of their own success.
p243_210.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243_211.txt|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_212.txt|It is going to change the world.
p243_213.txt|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243_214.txt|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243_215.txt|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243_216.txt|I am not going to judge them.
p243_217.txt|I do not see this so much as failure.
p243_218.txt|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243_219.txt|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p243_220.txt|I was independent but I am not now.
p243_221.txt|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p243_222.txt|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_223.txt|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243_224.txt|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p243_225.txt|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p243_227.txt|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243_228.txt|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243_229.txt|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p243_230.txt|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243_231.txt|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_232.txt|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243_233.txt|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243_234.txt|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p243_235.txt|You are not allowed to do that.
p243_236.txt|That is the last thing they need.
p243_237.txt|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243_238.txt|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p243_239.txt|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243_240.txt|Was it the wife ?
p243_241.txt|Why change it ?
p243_242.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p243_243.txt|Does the name matter ?
p243_244.txt|how do you get it back ?
p243_245.txt|What are you not good at ?
p243_246.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p243_247.txt|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243_248.txt|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p243_249.txt|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_250.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243_251.txt|However, the figures tell a different story.
p243_252.txt|The rise has come too late for some.
p243_253.txt|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243_254.txt|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p243_255.txt|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p243_256.txt|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243_257.txt|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243_258.txt|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p243_259.txt|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_260.txt|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p243_261.txt|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_262.txt|There would be a north and south division.
p243_263.txt|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p243_264.txt|The two companies were not for sale.
p243_265.txt|His condition was described as serious last night.
p243_266.txt|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243_267.txt|The board do not own the company.
p243_268.txt|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p243_269.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p243_270.txt|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p243_271.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p243_272.txt|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_273.txt|I think I was about four years old.
p243_274.txt|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243_275.txt|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_276.txt|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243_277.txt|I think the shares are good value.
p243_278.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p243_279.txt|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p243_280.txt|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p243_281.txt|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243_282.txt|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p243_283.txt|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243_284.txt|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p243_286.txt|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243_287.txt|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p243_288.txt|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_289.txt|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p243_290.txt|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243_291.txt|He would get into any world team.
p243_292.txt|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243_293.txt|They first met during a Step in London.
p243_294.txt|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_295.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243_296.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p243_297.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243_298.txt|It is based on population rather than need.
p243_299.txt|He could understand both points of view.
p243_300.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p243_301.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p243_302.txt|And does it ?
p243_303.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p243_304.txt|Had I heard ?
p243_305.txt|What happened in that game ?
p243_306.txt|Are you going to win ?
p243_308.txt|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_309.txt|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243_310.txt|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243_311.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p243_312.txt|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243_313.txt|For that reason cover should not be given.
p243_314.txt|He felt too close to head office.
p243_315.txt|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243_316.txt|A report on their property is due within days.
p243_317.txt|He will just go on doing his job.
p243_318.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p243_319.txt|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_320.txt|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243_321.txt|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243_322.txt|We will not simply hit these people.
p243_323.txt|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_324.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p243_325.txt|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p243_326.txt|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p243_327.txt|I try to be open to experience.
p243_328.txt|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p243_329.txt|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_330.txt|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p243_331.txt|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243_332.txt|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_333.txt|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243_334.txt|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p243_335.txt|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243_336.txt|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_337.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p243_338.txt|How are you, sir ?
p243_339.txt|So is that it, then ?
p243_340.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p243_341.txt|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p243_342.txt|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p243_343.txt|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243_344.txt|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243_345.txt|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_346.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p243_347.txt|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243_348.txt|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p243_349.txt|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_350.txt|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_352.txt|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p243_353.txt|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243_354.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p243_355.txt|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_356.txt|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p243_357.txt|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243_358.txt|His style was direct and very human.
p243_359.txt|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243_360.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p243_361.txt|The institute board will take the decision.
p243_362.txt|He's young enough and he must learn.
p243_363.txt|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p243_364.txt|Both players gave so much to the side.
p243_365.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243_366.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p243_367.txt|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243_368.txt|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_369.txt|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_370.txt|I have come here to show support for the families.
p243_371.txt|We have been going for three years.
p243_372.txt|He really played us into a corner.
p243_373.txt|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243_374.txt|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243_375.txt|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p243_376.txt|It used to be all hard sell.
p243_377.txt|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243_378.txt|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243_379.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p243_380.txt|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_381.txt|This is not a small amount of money.
p243_382.txt|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_383.txt|I just felt that I was broken down.
p243_384.txt|What do we do ?
p243_385.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p243_386.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p243_387.txt|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p243_388.txt|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243_389.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p243_390.txt|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243_391.txt|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p243_392.txt|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p243_393.txt|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243_394.txt|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_395.txt|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p243_396.txt|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_397.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p243_398.txt|People have a wish to charge twice.
p244_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p244_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p244_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p244_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p244_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p244_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p244_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p244_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p244_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p244_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p244_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p244_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p244_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p244_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p244_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p244_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p244_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p244_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p244_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p244_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p244_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p244_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p244_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p244_025.txt|We are a service industry.
p244_026.txt|It may be good for the soul.
p244_027.txt|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p244_029.txt|It is about investing in the future.
p244_030.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p244_031.txt|They were in good humour, too.
p244_032.txt|The end result is the same.
p244_033.txt|It is on the internet.
p244_034.txt|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244_035.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p244_036.txt|This is a central issue.
p244_037.txt|History is in the making.
p244_038.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p244_039.txt|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p244_040.txt|She was at the top.
p244_041.txt|In London today, it was business as usual.
p244_042.txt|And they had a case.
p244_043.txt|Something has to be put in place.
p244_044.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p244_045.txt|They are going after them.
p244_046.txt|It is all about the story.
p244_047.txt|The whole thing is the music.
p244_048.txt|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p244_049.txt|That is still the case.
p244_050.txt|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_051.txt|In my view, it has to be done.
p244_052.txt|The pressure on the players will build.
p244_053.txt|Their campaign is in disarray.
p244_054.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p244_055.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p244_056.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p244_057.txt|Clearly, they had other problems.
p244_058.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_059.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p244_060.txt|We have got to deliver.
p244_061.txt|That was the difference today.
p244_062.txt|The company continues to grow.
p244_063.txt|He said it was for sale.
p244_064.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p244_065.txt|That is all in the past.
p244_066.txt|There is a lot to be done.
p244_067.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p244_068.txt|He has not been dropped.
p244_069.txt|It was an outstanding performance.
p244_070.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_071.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_072.txt|It is only the beginning.
p244_073.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p244_074.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p244_075.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p244_076.txt|She did that for the rest of her life.
p244_077.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p244_078.txt|That will be the office.
p244_079.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p244_080.txt|How are you, sir ?
p244_081.txt|So is that it, then ?
p244_082.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p244_083.txt|What do we do ?
p244_084.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p244_085.txt|It starts with the script.
p244_086.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244_087.txt|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_088.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p244_089.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p244_090.txt|It seems a good thing to try.
p244_091.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244_092.txt|It sounds a lot of money.
p244_093.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p244_094.txt|It is not a story.
p244_095.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244_096.txt|He is in the US.
p244_097.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p244_098.txt|It took an option on the process.
p244_099.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p244_100.txt|This is a game of confidence.
p244_101.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p244_102.txt|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p244_103.txt|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244_104.txt|The trick is to try it.
p244_105.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244_106.txt|Victory was never in doubt.
p244_107.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244_108.txt|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_109.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p244_110.txt|Then again, we could have.
p244_111.txt|There, you were just a body.
p244_112.txt|But he has not become a monster.
p244_113.txt|He is not a dancer.
p244_114.txt|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_115.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p244_116.txt|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244_117.txt|This is a sea change in approach.
p244_118.txt|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p244_119.txt|The procedures were not in place.
p244_120.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p244_121.txt|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p244_122.txt|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_123.txt|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244_124.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p244_125.txt|We had a great time.
p244_126.txt|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_127.txt|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244_128.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p244_129.txt|He wanted to record the group.
p244_130.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p244_131.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244_132.txt|It is hard to believe.
p244_133.txt|Or it would have been.
p244_134.txt|Three days later, he was killed.
p244_135.txt|Football is a passion for many.
p244_136.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p244_137.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p244_138.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p244_139.txt|And does it ?
p244_140.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p244_141.txt|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244_142.txt|That was the first step.
p244_143.txt|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244_144.txt|I have been in contact with him.
p244_145.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p244_146.txt|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p244_147.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p244_148.txt|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244_149.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p244_150.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p244_151.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p244_152.txt|It starts at the top.
p244_153.txt|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_154.txt|She does not want to speak.
p244_155.txt|It was all for good reason as well.
p244_156.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p244_157.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244_158.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p244_159.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p244_160.txt|We want to get there.
p244_161.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244_162.txt|There is a lack of staff.
p244_163.txt|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244_164.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p244_165.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244_166.txt|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p244_167.txt|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244_168.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244_169.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p244_170.txt|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244_171.txt|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p244_172.txt|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p244_173.txt|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244_174.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p244_175.txt|All the pressure was on him.
p244_176.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p244_177.txt|They have not been named.
p244_178.txt|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p244_179.txt|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244_180.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p244_181.txt|I was always in control.
p244_182.txt|It was by the numbers.
p244_183.txt|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p244_184.txt|It should never have happened.
p244_185.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p244_186.txt|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244_187.txt|It is difficult to say.
p244_188.txt|That is a question for the next manager.
p244_189.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p244_190.txt|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244_191.txt|It is simply not true.
p244_192.txt|Are you going to win ?
p244_193.txt|Was it the wife ?
p244_194.txt|Why change it ?
p244_195.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p244_196.txt|Does the name matter ?
p244_197.txt|That you can do it.
p244_198.txt|I would like to continue to develop.
p244_199.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p244_200.txt|He has defended the system.
p244_201.txt|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244_203.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p244_204.txt|It is not an issue.
p244_205.txt|They have to get that sorted.
p244_206.txt|We can take the city.
p244_207.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p244_208.txt|It was the story of the second half.
p244_209.txt|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244_210.txt|As many as the market will support.
p244_211.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p244_212.txt|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p244_213.txt|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p244_214.txt|This conference was never confirmed.
p244_215.txt|A team is a team.
p244_216.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p244_217.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p244_218.txt|It decided to blame the media.
p244_219.txt|THE force is with them.
p244_220.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244_221.txt|It was important to win today.
p244_222.txt|He was not injured in the attack.
p244_223.txt|Because he was born in England.
p244_224.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244_225.txt|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244_226.txt|I was not overly concerned about this.
p244_227.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p244_228.txt|We want this place to work.
p244_229.txt|It still has an effect.
p244_230.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244_231.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p244_232.txt|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244_233.txt|There is a lot of concern.
p244_234.txt|It will be decided in the next month.
p244_235.txt|We have to win the group.
p244_236.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244_237.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p244_238.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p244_239.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p244_240.txt|This is a fight to the death.
p244_241.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p244_242.txt|He is a man of the people.
p244_243.txt|The matter is under appeal.
p244_244.txt|And they were being paid ?
p244_245.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p244_246.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p244_247.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p244_248.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p244_249.txt|Did he trip ?
p244_250.txt|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244_251.txt|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244_252.txt|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244_253.txt|Instead, he missed the lot.
p244_254.txt|I was never in danger.
p244_255.txt|A lot has been written.
p244_256.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p244_257.txt|It was really good in the first week.
p244_258.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p244_259.txt|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244_260.txt|That is not the case in Europe.
p244_261.txt|But it was a loss.
p244_262.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p244_263.txt|The performance continues to improve.
p244_264.txt|It expected this trend to continue.
p244_265.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p244_266.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p244_267.txt|But we were in control at that point.
p244_268.txt|It has to be enforced.
p244_269.txt|The party has never fully recovered.
p244_270.txt|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p244_271.txt|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_272.txt|He must have a crack at it.
p244_273.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p244_274.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p244_275.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p244_276.txt|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p244_277.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p244_278.txt|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244_279.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p244_280.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p244_281.txt|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p244_282.txt|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p244_283.txt|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244_284.txt|It is important that he is involved.
p244_285.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p244_286.txt|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_287.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244_288.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p244_290.txt|I should think so, too.
p244_291.txt|None of the agencies was able to help.
p244_292.txt|I didn't see the point.
p244_293.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p244_294.txt|We are in a war.
p244_295.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296.txt|Is our children learning ?
p244_297.txt|How independent is that ?
p244_298.txt|What form did that take ?
p244_299.txt|Are they free ?
p244_300.txt|Scotland won by six wickets.
p244_301.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244_302.txt|This is a historic agreement.
p244_303.txt|We have to be realistic.
p244_304.txt|Every one is a winner.
p244_305.txt|There was a hole in it.
p244_306.txt|It will be done in stages.
p244_307.txt|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244_308.txt|Every character was completely different.
p244_309.txt|But it is a similar problem.
p244_310.txt|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_311.txt|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p244_312.txt|In that moment, I was happy.
p244_313.txt|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p244_314.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p244_315.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p244_316.txt|It involved the same people.
p244_317.txt|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p244_318.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p244_319.txt|Look at the potential of this club.
p244_320.txt|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p244_321.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p244_322.txt|We did something about it.
p244_323.txt|But it is up again.
p244_324.txt|However, the devil is in the detail.
p244_325.txt|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p244_326.txt|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244_327.txt|He is already in place.
p244_328.txt|Another difference is the cost.
p244_329.txt|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244_330.txt|And we can do it.
p244_331.txt|What are they for ?
p244_333.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p244_335.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p244_336.txt|It is a sensitive issue.
p244_337.txt|They have to be addressed.
p244_338.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p244_339.txt|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p244_340.txt|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244_341.txt|However, a bid was never made.
p244_342.txt|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244_343.txt|Something is going to have to give.
p244_344.txt|And the context is also completely different.
p244_345.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p244_346.txt|The banking sector was weak.
p244_347.txt|But the New Year was special.
p244_348.txt|We never played at all.
p244_349.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p244_350.txt|This isn't the end of story.
p244_351.txt|He is a great prospect.
p244_352.txt|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244_353.txt|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244_354.txt|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244_355.txt|This latter suggestion is very important.
p244_356.txt|However, it does not tell the full story.
p244_357.txt|They were impressive against France.
p244_358.txt|The challenge is to win a cup.
p244_359.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p244_360.txt|It was a test in itself.
p244_361.txt|Either team will be hard.
p244_362.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p244_363.txt|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p244_364.txt|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_365.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p244_366.txt|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p244_367.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p244_368.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244_369.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p244_370.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p244_371.txt|I have a good feeling about this.
p244_372.txt|The news is not all bad.
p244_373.txt|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_374.txt|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244_375.txt|It is almost certain to be the last.
p244_376.txt|You have to be patient.
p244_377.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244_378.txt|I was delighted to accept.
p244_379.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p244_380.txt|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244_381.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p244_382.txt|It's fantastic to win again.
p244_383.txt|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p244_384.txt|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_385.txt|Everything is in the mix.
p244_386.txt|An announcement is expected this week.
p244_387.txt|He will be difficult to replace.
p244_388.txt|I would be interested in another attempt.
p244_389.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p244_390.txt|He was on a mission.
p244_391.txt|Does it matter ?
p244_392.txt|How do you take them away ?
p244_393.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p244_394.txt|After the match, do you ?
p244_395.txt|One-third of the places are already taken.
p244_396.txt|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p244_397.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p244_398.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p244_399.txt|I want this one to be different.
p244_400.txt|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244_401.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p244_402.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p244_403.txt|He is a quality player.
p244_404.txt|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p244_405.txt|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_406.txt|There is a demand for it.
p244_407.txt|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244_408.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p244_409.txt|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p244_410.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244_411.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244_412.txt|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244_413.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p244_414.txt|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p244_415.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p244_416.txt|There is no need to panic.
p244_417.txt|It had been on the cards.
p244_418.txt|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_419.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p244_420.txt|That might mean another delay.
p244_421.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p244_422.txt|I am delighted for them.
p244_423.txt|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244_424.txt|But it was a struggle.
p245_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p245_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p245_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p245_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p245_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p245_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p245_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p245_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p245_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p245_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p245_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p245_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p245_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p245_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p245_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p245_016.txt|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p245_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p245_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p245_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p245_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p245_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p245_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p245_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p245_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p245_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p245_026.txt|But it failed.
p245_027.txt|It's nice to hear.
p245_028.txt|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p245_029.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p245_030.txt|They should be so lucky.
p245_031.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p245_032.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p245_033.txt|I was an athlete.
p245_034.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p245_035.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p245_036.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245_037.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245_038.txt|It has failed.
p245_039.txt|It was clear.
p245_040.txt|It's a great thing.
p245_041.txt|Indeed, he does.
p245_042.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p245_043.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p245_044.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p245_045.txt|Sure, it's funny.
p245_046.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p245_047.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p245_048.txt|We need to chat.
p245_049.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p245_050.txt|Who can say?
p245_051.txt|It's a blessing.
p245_053.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p245_054.txt|They had to explain it.
p245_055.txt|He had no enemies.
p245_056.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p245_057.txt|None has ever been found.
p245_058.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p245_059.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p245_060.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p245_061.txt|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p245_062.txt|He should have asked for a second opinion.
p245_063.txt|He was popular.
p245_064.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p245_065.txt|The script was funny.
p245_066.txt|You need a trademark.
p245_067.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p245_068.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p245_069.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p245_070.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p245_071.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p245_072.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p245_073.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p245_074.txt|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p245_075.txt|What has changed?
p245_076.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p245_077.txt|That is bound to happen.
p245_078.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p245_079.txt|We have other options.
p245_080.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p245_081.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p245_082.txt|It's never too late.
p245_083.txt|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p245_084.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p245_085.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p245_086.txt|It is a lifeline.
p245_087.txt|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p245_088.txt|Then came the crunch.
p245_089.txt|If you could find it.
p245_090.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p245_091.txt|They were outside the circle.
p245_092.txt|He's a star.
p245_093.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p245_094.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p245_095.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p245_096.txt|No date has been set for the appeal.
p245_097.txt|It was an adventure.
p245_098.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p245_099.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p245_100.txt|I was angry.
p245_101.txt|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p245_102.txt|I have had no social life at all.
p245_103.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p245_104.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p245_105.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p245_106.txt|Who would be a referee?
p245_107.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p245_108.txt|Who would have?
p245_109.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p245_110.txt|We work on the same level.
p245_111.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p245_112.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p245_113.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p245_114.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p245_115.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p245_116.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p245_117.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p245_118.txt|He has been under great pressure.
p245_119.txt|Who will attend?
p245_120.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p245_121.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p245_122.txt|What will happen then?
p245_123.txt|Is that it?
p245_124.txt|He was in a great deal of pain.
p245_125.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p245_126.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p245_127.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p245_128.txt|I was awful.
p245_129.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p245_130.txt|It is not just about pay.
p245_131.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p245_132.txt|They did very well.
p245_133.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p245_134.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p245_135.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p245_136.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p245_137.txt|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p245_138.txt|Mr Blair had done well.
p245_139.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245_140.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p245_141.txt|He can do no wrong.
p245_142.txt|Was this element always there?
p245_143.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p245_144.txt|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p245_145.txt|It has to be now.
p245_146.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p245_147.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p245_148.txt|That will do for me.
p245_149.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p245_150.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p245_151.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p245_152.txt|It became a book by itself.
p245_154.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p245_155.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p245_156.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p245_157.txt|I drove the ball well.
p245_158.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p245_160.txt|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p245_161.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p245_162.txt|They will run a mile.
p245_163.txt|We did everything by the book.
p245_164.txt|It is not fair.
p245_165.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p245_166.txt|I had a train to catch.
p245_167.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p245_168.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p245_170.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p245_171.txt|People will ask about us.
p245_172.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p245_173.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p245_174.txt|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p245_175.txt|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p245_176.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p245_177.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p245_178.txt|It was still there, but right at the end.
p245_179.txt|The conference is the first test.
p245_180.txt|Is that success?
p245_181.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p245_182.txt|The red card was okay.
p245_183.txt|I have a cold.
p245_184.txt|They are in the euro.
p245_185.txt|He's not perfect.
p245_186.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p245_187.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p245_188.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p245_189.txt|That will be vital.
p245_190.txt|Now, it's all right.
p245_191.txt|It's like a garage.
p245_192.txt|We don't even know his name.
p245_193.txt|Feel the heat?
p245_194.txt|He knows a lot.
p245_195.txt|I began to pray.
p245_196.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p245_197.txt|His third goal was superb.
p245_198.txt|It's been a good year.
p245_199.txt|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p245_200.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p245_201.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p245_202.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p245_203.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p245_204.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p245_205.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p245_206.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p245_207.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p245_208.txt|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p245_209.txt|You have to do your research.
p245_210.txt|Saturday is gone.
p245_211.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p245_212.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p245_213.txt|It was good fun.
p245_214.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p245_215.txt|It's so special.
p245_216.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p245_217.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p245_218.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p245_219.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p245_220.txt|They had no children.
p245_221.txt|We are in the hat.
p245_222.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p245_223.txt|They should come forward.
p245_224.txt|It is not the message alone.
p245_225.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p245_226.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p245_227.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p245_228.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p245_229.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p245_230.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p245_231.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p245_232.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p245_233.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p245_234.txt|It's only fair.
p245_235.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p245_236.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p245_237.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p245_238.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p245_239.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p245_240.txt|I was shocked.
p245_241.txt|They are different types.
p245_242.txt|It was a hit.
p245_243.txt|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p245_244.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p245_245.txt|This year I understood.
p245_246.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p245_247.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p245_248.txt|Is there on his hands?
p245_249.txt|I can't get a job.
p245_250.txt|It is nearly there.
p245_251.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p245_252.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p245_253.txt|It's that kind of place.
p245_254.txt|they fail to engage.
p245_256.txt|I was happily surprised.
p245_257.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p245_258.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p245_259.txt|I HAVE a dream.
p245_260.txt|It is set in Paris.
p245_261.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p245_262.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p245_263.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p245_264.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p245_265.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p245_266.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p245_267.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p245_268.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p245_269.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p245_270.txt|People have no choice.
p245_271.txt|She looked so young.
p245_272.txt|It happens from time to time.
p245_273.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p245_274.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p245_275.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p245_276.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p245_277.txt|It was a virus.
p245_278.txt|Yet, it worked.
p245_279.txt|It's very safe.
p245_280.txt|Well, he can do it.
p245_281.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p245_282.txt|It goes back a long way.
p245_283.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p245_284.txt|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p245_285.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p245_286.txt|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p245_287.txt|That could change.
p245_288.txt|The goals will come.
p245_289.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p245_290.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p245_291.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p245_292.txt|He has retired.
p245_293.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p245_294.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p245_295.txt|Nothing is safe.
p245_296.txt|They are wrong.
p245_297.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p245_298.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p245_299.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p245_300.txt|It's just not funny!
p245_301.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p245_302.txt|And he goes with it.
p245_303.txt|You are the glory.
p245_304.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p245_305.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p245_306.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p245_307.txt|He was solid.
p245_308.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p245_309.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p245_310.txt|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p245_311.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p245_312.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p245_313.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p245_314.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p245_315.txt|They had a confession.
p245_316.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p245_317.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p245_318.txt|There was no time scale.
p245_319.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p245_320.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p245_321.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p245_322.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p245_323.txt|I saw some good things.
p245_324.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p245_325.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p245_326.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p245_327.txt|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p245_328.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p245_329.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p245_330.txt|Who will do it?
p245_331.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p245_332.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p245_333.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p245_334.txt|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p245_335.txt|The train was on time.
p245_336.txt|Action is needed now.
p245_337.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p245_338.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p245_339.txt|I would miss him.
p245_340.txt|There's no place to hide.
p245_341.txt|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p245_342.txt|I'm very lucky.
p245_343.txt|It was forced to divert.
p245_344.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p245_345.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p245_346.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p245_347.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p245_348.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p245_349.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p245_350.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p245_351.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p245_352.txt|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p245_353.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p245_354.txt|It was very formal.
p245_355.txt|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p245_356.txt|It's not that clear-cut.
p245_357.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p245_358.txt|He's very explosive.
p245_359.txt|But nothing happened.
p246_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p246_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p246_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p246_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p246_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p246_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p246_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p246_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p246_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p246_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p246_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p246_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p246_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p246_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p246_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p246_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p246_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p246_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p246_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p246_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p246_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p246_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p246_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p246_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p246_025.txt|He has not been named.
p246_026.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p246_027.txt|Is this accurate?
p246_028.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p246_029.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246_030.txt|There's a story, too.
p246_031.txt|This is the window.
p246_032.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p246_033.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p246_034.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p246_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p246_036.txt|It has failed.
p246_037.txt|They're just different.
p246_038.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p246_039.txt|Indeed, he does.
p246_040.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p246_041.txt|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246_042.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246_043.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246_044.txt|We will push.
p246_045.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246_046.txt|They said she was stable.
p246_047.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p246_048.txt|There is no reason at all.
p246_049.txt|The State would provide.
p246_050.txt|She looked so young.
p246_051.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p246_052.txt|Here's a clue.
p246_053.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246_054.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p246_055.txt|It is unique.
p246_056.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246_057.txt|That's the truth.
p246_058.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p246_059.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246_060.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p246_061.txt|It's that kind of place.
p246_062.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246_063.txt|He could make it.
p246_064.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p246_065.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p246_066.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p246_067.txt|There could be a way back.
p246_068.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p246_069.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246_070.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p246_071.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246_072.txt|Even the one she loved.
p246_073.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p246_074.txt|Today she has been released.
p246_075.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p246_076.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p246_077.txt|He is in the queue.
p246_078.txt|I first met him last summer.
p246_079.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p246_080.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p246_081.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p246_082.txt|It is a blow.
p246_083.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p246_084.txt|They lived for their children.
p246_085.txt|It will be tight.
p246_086.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p246_087.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p246_088.txt|Tony Blair said as little.
p246_089.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p246_090.txt|This one did.
p246_091.txt|It was clear.
p246_092.txt|But I was wrong.
p246_093.txt|It is home-grown.
p246_094.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p246_095.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p246_096.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p246_097.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p246_098.txt|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p246_099.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p246_100.txt|That would be unlawful.
p246_101.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p246_102.txt|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p246_103.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p246_104.txt|It was an adventure.
p246_105.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p246_106.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p246_107.txt|Is that right?
p246_108.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p246_109.txt|It was the eighties.
p246_110.txt|It is so sad.
p246_111.txt|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p246_112.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p246_113.txt|Who would be a referee?
p246_114.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p246_115.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p246_116.txt|Who would have?
p246_117.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p246_118.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p246_119.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p246_120.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p246_121.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p246_122.txt|It is not a U-turn.
p246_123.txt|I just wanted a break.
p246_124.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p246_125.txt|I am now unemployed.
p246_126.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p246_127.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p246_128.txt|It's perfectly feasible.
p246_129.txt|We work well together.
p246_130.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p246_131.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p246_132.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p246_133.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p246_134.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p246_135.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p246_136.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p246_137.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p246_138.txt|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p246_139.txt|She died at her home.
p246_140.txt|He realises his mistake.
p246_141.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p246_142.txt|I was awful.
p246_143.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p246_144.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p246_145.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p246_146.txt|It is not just about pay.
p246_147.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p246_148.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p246_149.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p246_150.txt|I was stunned.
p246_151.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p246_152.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p246_153.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p246_154.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p246_155.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p246_156.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p246_157.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p246_158.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p246_159.txt|I will tell you.
p246_160.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p246_161.txt|It is not like us.
p246_162.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p246_163.txt|We have a budget in March.
p246_164.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p246_165.txt|We should do everything at a stroke.
p246_166.txt|You had to go and see him.
p246_167.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p246_168.txt|He was a crazy man.
p246_169.txt|As we worked.
p246_170.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p246_171.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p246_172.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p246_173.txt|I drove the ball well.
p246_174.txt|Tony had arrived.
p246_175.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p246_176.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p246_177.txt|The goals were good.
p246_178.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p246_179.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p246_180.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p246_181.txt|It's to do with context.
p246_182.txt|Does this matter?
p246_183.txt|One was a lawyer.
p246_184.txt|There is no openness.
p246_185.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p246_186.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p246_187.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p246_188.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p246_189.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p246_190.txt|The concerns are the same.
p246_191.txt|Is that success?
p246_192.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p246_193.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p246_194.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p246_195.txt|Who will pay for this?
p246_196.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p246_197.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p246_198.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p246_199.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p246_200.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p246_201.txt|I will win.
p246_202.txt|Feel the heat?
p246_203.txt|He knows a lot.
p246_204.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p246_205.txt|It had all been arranged.
p246_206.txt|I have decided to quit the show.
p246_207.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p246_208.txt|It's not ideal.
p246_209.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p246_210.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p246_211.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p246_212.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p246_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p246_214.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p246_215.txt|The report is due out next month.
p246_216.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p246_217.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p246_218.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p246_219.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p246_220.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p246_221.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p246_222.txt|It's not before time.
p246_223.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p246_224.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p246_225.txt|But she was.
p246_226.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p246_227.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p246_228.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p246_229.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p246_230.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p246_231.txt|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p246_232.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p246_233.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p246_234.txt|You should be.
p246_235.txt|It's quite nice.
p246_236.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p246_237.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p246_238.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p246_239.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p246_240.txt|It is hard won.
p246_241.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p246_242.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p246_243.txt|The scene is about this?
p246_244.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p246_245.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p246_246.txt|I should think so, too.
p246_247.txt|It was a hit.
p246_248.txt|There's the mix.
p246_249.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p246_250.txt|Is there on his hands?
p246_251.txt|I can't get a job.
p246_252.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p246_253.txt|they fail to engage.
p246_254.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p246_255.txt|Is that a serious question?
p246_256.txt|They must play for each other.
p246_257.txt|I could have got out a long time ago.
p246_258.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p246_259.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p246_260.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p246_261.txt|Souter will be back.
p246_262.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p246_263.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p246_264.txt|It will be done in stages.
p246_265.txt|There is no link.
p246_266.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p246_267.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p246_268.txt|We are happy.
p246_270.txt|We're in shock.
p246_271.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p246_272.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p246_273.txt|It's a way of life.
p246_274.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p246_275.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p246_276.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p246_277.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p246_278.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p246_279.txt|It is so very obvious.
p246_280.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p246_281.txt|It's so awful.
p246_282.txt|If not, he should go home.
p246_283.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p246_284.txt|We are a grandmother.
p246_285.txt|But I've won both ways.
p246_286.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p246_287.txt|You feel very helpless.
p246_288.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p246_289.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p246_290.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p246_291.txt|It was a virus.
p246_292.txt|Yet, it worked.
p246_293.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p246_294.txt|It was good.
p246_295.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p246_296.txt|We are not going to forget.
p246_297.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p246_298.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p246_299.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p246_300.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p246_301.txt|What has altered?
p246_302.txt|She is really magic.
p246_303.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p246_304.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p246_305.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p246_306.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p246_307.txt|The plot is minimal.
p246_308.txt|You are the glory.
p246_309.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p246_310.txt|The letters are going out today.
p246_311.txt|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p246_312.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p246_313.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p246_314.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p246_315.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p246_316.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p246_318.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p246_319.txt|They had a confession.
p246_320.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p246_321.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p246_322.txt|Off with their heads.
p246_323.txt|There was no time scale.
p246_324.txt|Either team will be hard.
p246_325.txt|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p246_326.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p246_327.txt|Is that an issue?
p246_328.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p246_329.txt|Who will do it?
p246_330.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p246_331.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p246_332.txt|This is the last straw.
p246_333.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p246_334.txt|I've got no secret.
p246_335.txt|He loved the moment.
p246_336.txt|I'm very lucky.
p246_337.txt|Our policy is clear.
p246_338.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p246_339.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p246_340.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p246_341.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p246_342.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p246_343.txt|I got a yellow card.
p246_344.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p246_345.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p246_346.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p246_347.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p246_348.txt|Until they came to do it.
p246_349.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p246_350.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p246_351.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p246_352.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246_353.txt|Hartley should know.
p246_354.txt|That would help.
p246_355.txt|It is a memorial.
p246_357.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p246_358.txt|Their time has gone.
p246_359.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p246_360.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p246_361.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p247p248_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p248_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p248_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p248_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p248_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p248_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p248_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p248_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p248_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p248_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p248_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p248_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p248_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p248_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p248_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p248_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p248_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p248_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p248_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p248_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p248_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p248_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p248_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p248_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p248_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p248_026.txt|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p248_027.txt|But it failed.
p248_028.txt|That's no bad thing.
p248_029.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p248_030.txt|I have a theory.
p248_031.txt|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p248_032.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p248_033.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p248_034.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p248_035.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p248_036.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p248_037.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p248_038.txt|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248_039.txt|It was clear.
p248_040.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p248_041.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p248_042.txt|I was scared.
p248_043.txt|It was ugly.
p248_044.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p248_045.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248_046.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p248_047.txt|It is urgent.
p248_048.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248_049.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p248_050.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248_051.txt|But it might have done.
p248_052.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p248_053.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p248_054.txt|They had to explain it.
p248_055.txt|Here's a clue.
p248_056.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p248_057.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p248_058.txt|It's very odd.
p248_059.txt|It will take time.
p248_060.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248_061.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248_062.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p248_063.txt|It is not great art.
p248_064.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248_065.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p248_066.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p248_067.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p248_068.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p248_069.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p248_070.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p248_071.txt|There was an e-mail.
p248_072.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p248_073.txt|Neither it is.
p248_074.txt|I had my suspicions.
p248_075.txt|He got the same story.
p248_076.txt|It works for us.
p248_077.txt|It is a time bomb.
p248_078.txt|Today she has been released.
p248_079.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p248_080.txt|It may well have been.
p248_081.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p248_082.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p248_083.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p248_084.txt|We have other options.
p248_085.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p248_086.txt|It's never too late.
p248_087.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p248_088.txt|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p248_089.txt|They lived for their children.
p248_090.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p248_091.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p248_092.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p248_093.txt|He was possessed
p248_094.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p248_095.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p248_096.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p248_097.txt|I had a ball today.
p248_098.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p248_099.txt|That's all right then.
p248_100.txt|That would be unlawful.
p248_101.txt|That time is not now, however.
p248_102.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p248_103.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p248_104.txt|That is no use.
p248_105.txt|That all hope is never lost.
p248_106.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p248_107.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p248_108.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p248_109.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p248_110.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p248_111.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p248_112.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p248_113.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p248_114.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p248_115.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p248_116.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p248_117.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p248_118.txt|But the fans deserve to know!
p248_119.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p248_120.txt|They've got to account for it.
p248_121.txt|She's got to say something.
p248_122.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p248_123.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p248_124.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p248_125.txt|She does not want to speak.
p248_126.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p248_127.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p248_128.txt|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p248_129.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p248_130.txt|I had relied on him.
p248_131.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p248_132.txt|It's the big omission.
p248_133.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p248_134.txt|Our intentions are real.
p248_135.txt|Government will intervene.
p248_136.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p248_137.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p248_138.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p248_139.txt|It was typical.
p248_140.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p248_141.txt|He has the edge.
p248_142.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p248_143.txt|It's a crucial award.
p248_144.txt|He is severe.
p248_145.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p248_146.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p248_147.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p248_148.txt|It is like a football team.
p248_149.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p248_150.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p248_151.txt|It is huge.
p248_152.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p248_153.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p248_154.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p248_155.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p248_156.txt|That includes the equipment?
p248_157.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p248_158.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p248_159.txt|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p248_160.txt|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p248_161.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p248_162.txt|It has to be now.
p248_163.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248_164.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p248_165.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p248_166.txt|It's that sort of night.
p248_167.txt|We have a budget in March.
p248_168.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p248_169.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p248_170.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p248_171.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p248_172.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p248_173.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p248_174.txt|The jury is still out.
p248_175.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p248_176.txt|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p248_177.txt|And I saw the light!
p248_178.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p248_179.txt|Tony had arrived.
p248_180.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p248_181.txt|The goals were good.
p248_182.txt|I've been there.
p248_183.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p248_184.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p248_185.txt|We did everything by the book.
p248_186.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p248_187.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p248_188.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p248_189.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p248_190.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p248_191.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p248_192.txt|All options are open.
p248_193.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p248_194.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p248_195.txt|It wasn't to be.
p248_196.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p248_197.txt|It's the same old story.
p248_198.txt|It was still there, but right at the end.
p248_199.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p248_200.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p248_201.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p248_202.txt|But she might be.
p248_203.txt|It's just awful.
p248_204.txt|Today was first class.
p248_205.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p248_206.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p248_207.txt|Now, it's all right.
p248_208.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p248_209.txt|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p248_210.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p248_211.txt|He is slightly confused.
p248_212.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p248_213.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p248_214.txt|It had all been arranged.
p248_215.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p248_216.txt|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p248_217.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p248_218.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p248_219.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p248_220.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p248_221.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p248_222.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p248_223.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p248_224.txt|It was good fun.
p248_225.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p248_226.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p248_227.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p248_228.txt|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p248_229.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p248_230.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p248_231.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p248_232.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p248_233.txt|It is set in Paris.
p248_234.txt|They should come forward.
p248_235.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p248_236.txt|It's very safe.
p248_237.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p248_238.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p248_239.txt|It is no surprise.
p248_240.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p248_241.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p248_242.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p248_243.txt|She is well balanced.
p248_244.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p248_245.txt|It is hard won.
p248_246.txt|The scene is about this?
p248_247.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p248_248.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p248_249.txt|It was a cry for help.
p248_250.txt|It was a hit.
p248_251.txt|This year I understood.
p248_252.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p248_253.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p248_254.txt|We run within the law.
p248_255.txt|Kirkwood was arrested.
p248_256.txt|they fail to engage.
p248_257.txt|They are real.
p248_258.txt|They must play for each other.
p248_259.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p248_260.txt|It is also very valuable.
p248_261.txt|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p248_262.txt|That is highly unfair.
p248_263.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p248_264.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p248_265.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p248_266.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p248_267.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p248_268.txt|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p248_269.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p248_270.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p248_271.txt|He was also married with two children.
p248_272.txt|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p248_273.txt|It's a way of life.
p248_274.txt|I feel pretty good.
p248_275.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p248_276.txt|If not, he should go home.
p248_277.txt|He looked very sharp.
p248_278.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p248_279.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p248_280.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p248_281.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p248_282.txt|It was a virus.
p248_283.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p248_284.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p248_285.txt|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p248_286.txt|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p248_287.txt|It is not normal practice.
p248_288.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p248_289.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p248_290.txt|IT S all in the hair.
p248_291.txt|What has altered?
p248_292.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p248_293.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p248_294.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p248_295.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p248_296.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p248_297.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p248_298.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p248_299.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p248_300.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p248_301.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p248_302.txt|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p248_303.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p248_304.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p248_305.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p248_306.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p248_307.txt|It should be equal.
p248_308.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p248_309.txt|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p248_310.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p248_311.txt|Other people had looked at it.
p248_312.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p248_313.txt|Off with their heads.
p248_314.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p248_315.txt|Donald was his friend.
p248_316.txt|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p248_317.txt|He was unable to come.
p248_318.txt|I saw some good things.
p248_319.txt|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p248_320.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p248_321.txt|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p248_322.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p248_323.txt|Who will do it?
p248_324.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p248_325.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p248_326.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p248_327.txt|The train was on time.
p248_328.txt|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p248_329.txt|He has to learn.
p248_330.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p248_331.txt|There's no place to hide.
p248_332.txt|It will be very, very tight.
p248_333.txt|I said that I had been raped.
p248_334.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p248_335.txt|The composer will conduct.
p248_336.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p248_337.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p248_338.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p248_339.txt|It's the last thing on my mind.
p248_340.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p248_341.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p248_342.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p248_343.txt|It is horrible.
p248_344.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p248_345.txt|I kept going for her.
p248_346.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p248_347.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p248_348.txt|But nothing happened.
p248_349.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p248_350.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p248_351.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p248_352.txt|He has seen the past.
p248_353.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p248_354.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p248_355.txt|That would help.
p248_356.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p248_357.txt|Who was the mystery MP?
p248_358.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p248_359.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p248_360.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p248_361.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p248_362.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p248_363.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p248_364.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p248_365.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p248_366.txt|It is legally binding.
p248_367.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p248_368.txt|Five members were disciplined.
p248_369.txt|There is no signature.
p248_370.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p248_371.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p248_372.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p248_373.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p248_374.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p248_375.txt|The casualties were not named.
p248_376.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p249_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p249_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p249_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p249_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p249_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p249_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p249_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p249_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p249_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p249_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p249_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p249_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p249_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p249_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p249_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p249_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p249_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p249_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p249_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p249_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p249_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p249_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p249_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p249_026.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p249_027.txt|It's nice to hear.
p249_028.txt|They should be so lucky.
p249_029.txt|Because we do not need it.
p249_030.txt|There's a story, too.
p249_031.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p249_032.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p249_033.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p249_034.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p249_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p249_036.txt|It was clear.
p249_037.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p249_038.txt|He did not know his daughter.
p249_039.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p249_040.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249_041.txt|Sure, it's funny.
p249_042.txt|It's a crucial award.
p249_043.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p249_044.txt|It's a blessing.
p249_045.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p249_046.txt|As she explains.
p249_047.txt|He is too weak to move.
p249_048.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249_049.txt|I would love to have him home.
p249_050.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p249_051.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249_052.txt|It will come all right.
p249_053.txt|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249_054.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p249_055.txt|It happens from time to time.
p249_056.txt|It's very odd.
p249_057.txt|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249_058.txt|It is unique.
p249_059.txt|It will take time.
p249_060.txt|That's the truth.
p249_061.txt|Jobs could go.
p249_062.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249_063.txt|I'm just enjoying every match.
p249_064.txt|And a film maker was born.
p249_065.txt|You did not change overnight.
p249_066.txt|There was a battle there.
p249_067.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p249_068.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p249_069.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p249_070.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p249_071.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p249_072.txt|Try to save us.
p249_073.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p249_074.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p249_075.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p249_076.txt|The play is based on a real-life event.
p249_077.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p249_078.txt|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p249_079.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p249_080.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p249_081.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p249_082.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p249_083.txt|Even the one she loved.
p249_084.txt|I've not thought about it.
p249_086.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p249_087.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p249_088.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p249_089.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p249_090.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p249_092.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p249_093.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p249_094.txt|They lived for their children.
p249_095.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p249_096.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p249_097.txt|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p249_098.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p249_099.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p249_100.txt|We must look forward.
p249_101.txt|It is an old family habit.
p249_102.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p249_103.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p249_104.txt|Then came the crunch.
p249_105.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p249_106.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p249_107.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p249_108.txt|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p249_109.txt|It is a good day for the coalition.
p249_110.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p249_111.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p249_112.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p249_113.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249_114.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p249_115.txt|You had better believe it.
p249_116.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p249_117.txt|It's a long process.
p249_118.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p249_119.txt|It was ugly.
p249_120.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p249_121.txt|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p249_122.txt|Does this mean.
p249_123.txt|They've got to account for it.
p249_124.txt|Who would have?
p249_125.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p249_126.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p249_127.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p249_128.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p249_129.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p249_130.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249_131.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p249_132.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p249_133.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p249_134.txt|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p249_135.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p249_136.txt|What will happen then?
p249_137.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p249_138.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p249_139.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p249_140.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p249_141.txt|It's a question of fashion.
p249_142.txt|We need to chat.
p249_143.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p249_144.txt|He is severe.
p249_145.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p249_146.txt|Is that Titanic?
p249_147.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p249_148.txt|The idea is simple.
p249_149.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p249_150.txt|It is like a football team.
p249_152.txt|It is not just about pay.
p249_153.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p249_154.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p249_155.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p249_156.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p249_157.txt|It is not normal practice.
p249_159.txt|It was by the numbers.
p249_160.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p249_161.txt|There's a pause.
p249_162.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p249_163.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p249_164.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p249_165.txt|These days are long gone.
p249_166.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p249_167.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p249_168.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p249_169.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p249_170.txt|I'm so worried about the roads.
p249_171.txt|We have to move forward.
p249_172.txt|Tell it like it was?
p249_173.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p249_174.txt|We have a budget in March.
p249_176.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p249_177.txt|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p249_178.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p249_179.txt|Someone who cares
p249_180.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p249_181.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249_182.txt|The jury is still out.
p249_183.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p249_184.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p249_185.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p249_186.txt|It should be easy.
p249_187.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p249_188.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p249_189.txt|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p249_190.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p249_191.txt|It is not fair.
p249_192.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p249_193.txt|We want to help them through it.
p249_194.txt|I put the drawing down.
p249_196.txt|I had a train to catch.
p249_197.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p249_198.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p249_199.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p249_200.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p249_201.txt|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p249_202.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p249_203.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p249_204.txt|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p249_205.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p249_206.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p249_207.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p249_208.txt|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p249_209.txt|I have a cold.
p249_210.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p249_211.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p249_212.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p249_213.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p249_214.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p249_216.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p249_217.txt|This is a good move for me.
p249_218.txt|But I am a worried man.
p249_219.txt|There was an e-mail.
p249_220.txt|Feel the heat?
p249_221.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p249_222.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p249_223.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p249_224.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p249_225.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p249_226.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p249_229.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249_230.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p249_231.txt|It is a gamble.
p249_232.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p249_234.txt|He is in the queue.
p249_235.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p249_236.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p249_237.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p249_238.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p249_239.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p249_240.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p249_241.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p249_243.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p249_244.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p249_245.txt|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p249_246.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p249_247.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p249_248.txt|I was shocked.
p249_249.txt|I should think so, too.
p249_251.txt|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p249_252.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p249_253.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p249_254.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p249_255.txt|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p249_256.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p249_257.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p249_258.txt|They must play for each other.
p249_259.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p249_260.txt|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p249_261.txt|That's the only thing I will say.
p249_262.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p249_263.txt|They are never here.
p249_265.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p249_266.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p249_267.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p249_268.txt|It is the same in Sweden.
p249_269.txt|And Michael was just great.
p249_270.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p249_271.txt|It's not even finished.
p249_272.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p249_273.txt|Things can change.
p249_274.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p249_275.txt|People have no choice.
p249_276.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p249_277.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p249_278.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p249_279.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p249_280.txt|There's nothing I can say.
p249_281.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p249_282.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p249_283.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p249_284.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p249_285.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p249_286.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p249_287.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p249_288.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p249_289.txt|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p249_290.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p249_291.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p249_292.txt|He should have won.
p249_293.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p249_294.txt|A new school will be built.
p249_295.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p249_296.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p249_297.txt|What has altered?
p249_298.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p249_299.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p249_300.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p249_301.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p249_302.txt|They are wrong.
p249_303.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p249_304.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p249_305.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p249_306.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p249_307.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p249_308.txt|And he goes with it.
p249_309.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p249_310.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p249_311.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p249_312.txt|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p249_313.txt|Is there on his hands?
p249_314.txt|Special measures were needed.
p249_315.txt|They were fantastic.
p249_316.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p249_317.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p249_318.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p249_319.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p249_320.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p249_321.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p249_322.txt|That's the law of the land.
p249_323.txt|There was no time scale.
p249_324.txt|I am so upset.
p249_326.txt|It could have gone either way.
p249_327.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p249_328.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p249_329.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p249_330.txt|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p249_331.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p249_332.txt|Who will do it?
p249_335.txt|I must make that clear.
p249_336.txt|The train was on time.
p249_337.txt|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p249_338.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p249_339.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p249_340.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p249_341.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p249_342.txt|He's a genius.
p249_343.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p249_344.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p249_345.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p249_347.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p249_348.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p249_349.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p249_350.txt|It is horrible.
p249_351.txt|It was very formal.
p249_352.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p249_353.txt|I kept going for her.
p249_354.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p250_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p250_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p250_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p250_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p250_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p250_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p250_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p250_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p250_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p250_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p250_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p250_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p250_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p250_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p250_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p250_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p250_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p250_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p250_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p250_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p250_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p250_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p250_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p250_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p250_026.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p250_027.txt|I am pretty careful with money.
p250_028.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p250_030.txt|This is a central issue.
p250_031.txt|We will not tolerate it.
p250_032.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p250_033.txt|He works at the airport.
p250_034.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p250_035.txt|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p250_036.txt|It was just appalling luck.
p250_037.txt|Rugby has an extended run.
p250_038.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p250_039.txt|Costs have got to be controlled.
p250_040.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p250_042.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p250_043.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p250_044.txt|I made a terrible start.
p250_045.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p250_046.txt|How are you, sir ?
p250_047.txt|So is that it, then ?
p250_048.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p250_049.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p250_050.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p250_051.txt|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p250_052.txt|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p250_053.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p250_054.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p250_055.txt|The teacher would have approved.
p250_056.txt|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p250_057.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p250_058.txt|She said she was really sorry.
p250_059.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p250_060.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p250_061.txt|Let's hope that it does.
p250_062.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p250_063.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p250_064.txt|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
p250_065.txt|This is the first step.
p250_066.txt|We will pay their bills.
p250_067.txt|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p250_068.txt|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p250_069.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p250_070.txt|I am about protecting the state pension.
p250_071.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p250_072.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p250_073.txt|It wasn't possible to relax.
p250_074.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p250_075.txt|There's nothing they can get on me.
p250_076.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p250_077.txt|He was a lovely man.
p250_078.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p250_079.txt|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p250_080.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p250_081.txt|It makes for an interesting conference.
p250_082.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p250_083.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p250_084.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p250_085.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p250_086.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p250_087.txt|They lived for their children.
p250_088.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p250_089.txt|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p250_090.txt|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p250_091.txt|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250_092.txt|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p250_093.txt|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p250_094.txt|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p250_095.txt|It is high time to act.
p250_096.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p250_097.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p250_098.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p250_099.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p250_100.txt|And does it ?
p250_101.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p250_102.txt|Had I heard ?
p250_103.txt|It is an old family habit.
p250_104.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p250_105.txt|He was released after treatment.
p250_106.txt|We have made no final decisions.
p250_107.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p250_108.txt|We knew they could do it.
p250_109.txt|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p250_110.txt|They must be on commission.
p250_111.txt|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p250_113.txt|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p250_114.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p250_115.txt|It's good to have a voice.
p250_116.txt|He was prepared for this.
p250_117.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p250_118.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p250_119.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p250_120.txt|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p250_121.txt|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p250_123.txt|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p250_124.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p250_125.txt|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p250_126.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p250_127.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p250_128.txt|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p250_129.txt|I have learned from him.
p250_130.txt|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p250_131.txt|He thought she was amazing.
p250_132.txt|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p250_133.txt|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p250_134.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p250_135.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p250_136.txt|Failure is not an option.
p250_137.txt|She's got to say something.
p250_138.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p250_139.txt|This is a frightening development.
p250_140.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p250_141.txt|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p250_142.txt|That is far too high.
p250_143.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p250_144.txt|We did what we had to do.
p250_146.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p250_147.txt|You are a gambling man.
p250_148.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p250_149.txt|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p250_150.txt|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p250_151.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p250_152.txt|We will try to find someone.
p250_153.txt|She died at her home.
p250_154.txt|What happened in that game ?
p250_155.txt|Are you going to win ?
p250_156.txt|Was it the wife ?
p250_157.txt|Why change it ?
p250_158.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p250_159.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p250_160.txt|He was pleased with his display.
p250_161.txt|Life is still very tough for them.
p250_162.txt|It is not just about pay.
p250_163.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p250_164.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p250_165.txt|It has become a way of life.
p250_166.txt|The whole industry is a shambles.
p250_167.txt|People were actually not on his side.
p250_168.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p250_169.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p250_170.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p250_171.txt|They have not been named.
p250_172.txt|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p250_173.txt|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
p250_174.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p250_175.txt|He was asked to quit.
p250_176.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p250_177.txt|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p250_178.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p250_179.txt|You will be very welcome.
p250_180.txt|It had so much to do with output.
p250_181.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p250_182.txt|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250_183.txt|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p250_184.txt|They could not match it.
p250_185.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p250_186.txt|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250_187.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p250_188.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p250_189.txt|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250_190.txt|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p250_191.txt|Our fans have been marvellous.
p250_192.txt|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
p250_193.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p250_194.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p250_195.txt|They were seriously after him.
p250_196.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p250_197.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p250_198.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p250_199.txt|He was rejected because he had retired.
p250_200.txt|We always felt we could win.
p250_201.txt|It may have been a cry for help.
p250_202.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p250_204.txt|We are going through difficult times.
p250_205.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250_206.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p250_207.txt|You could feel the heat.
p250_208.txt|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
p250_209.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p250_210.txt|And we have the experience.
p250_211.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p250_212.txt|It gave no further details.
p250_214.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p250_215.txt|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p250_216.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p250_217.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_218.txt|It carried a double message.
p250_219.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p250_220.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p250_221.txt|That might help a bit.
p250_222.txt|Does the name matter ?
p250_223.txt|how do you get it back ?
p250_224.txt|What are you not good at ?
p250_225.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p250_226.txt|Who was she ?
p250_227.txt|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p250_228.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p250_229.txt|It had all been arranged.
p250_230.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p250_231.txt|His third goal was superb.
p250_232.txt|It will affect their work.
p250_233.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p250_234.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p250_235.txt|The process will start tomorrow.
p250_236.txt|It's just a normal life.
p250_237.txt|The transaction is not feasible.
p250_238.txt|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p250_239.txt|It is good for our team.
p250_240.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p250_241.txt|That you can do it.
p250_242.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p250_243.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p250_244.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p250_245.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p250_246.txt|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p250_247.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p250_248.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p250_249.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p250_250.txt|She will attend in July.
p250_251.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p250_252.txt|The most important thing is the game.
p250_253.txt|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250_254.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p250_255.txt|The right decision has been made.
p250_257.txt|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p250_258.txt|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250_260.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p250_261.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p250_262.txt|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p250_263.txt|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p250_264.txt|He is a reporter for us.
p250_265.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p250_266.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p250_267.txt|We've had several problems over injuries.
p250_268.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p250_269.txt|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p250_270.txt|It was a kind of contempt.
p250_271.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p250_272.txt|I should think so, too.
p250_273.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p250_274.txt|Messages have to be reinforced.
p250_275.txt|I got a yellow card.
p250_276.txt|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p250_277.txt|We accept the new rules.
p250_278.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p250_280.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p250_281.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p250_282.txt|We are aiming for early March.
p250_283.txt|I felt about this big.
p250_284.txt|And they were being paid ?
p250_285.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p250_286.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p250_287.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p250_288.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p250_289.txt|It is also very valuable.
p250_290.txt|I feel really confident in that department.
p250_291.txt|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p250_292.txt|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p250_293.txt|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p250_294.txt|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p250_295.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p250_296.txt|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p250_297.txt|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
p250_298.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p250_299.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p250_300.txt|I understand the security issue.
p250_301.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p250_302.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p250_304.txt|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p250_305.txt|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
p250_306.txt|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p250_308.txt|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p250_309.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p250_310.txt|You have to expect this type of thing.
p250_311.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p250_312.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250_313.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p250_314.txt|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p250_315.txt|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p250_316.txt|I wanted to change the formula.
p250_317.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p250_318.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p250_319.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p250_320.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p250_321.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p250_322.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p250_323.txt|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p250_324.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p250_325.txt|There's still no-one like him.
p250_326.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p250_327.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p250_328.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p250_329.txt|The takeover comes as no surprise.
p250_330.txt|Job losses were also announced.
p250_331.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p250_332.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250_333.txt|The party lasted all night.
p250_334.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p250_335.txt|It was nice to finish in style.
p250_336.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p250_337.txt|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
p250_338.txt|And he goes with it.
p250_339.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p250_340.txt|There will be good prospects ahead.
p250_341.txt|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p250_342.txt|The letters are going out today.
p250_343.txt|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p250_344.txt|We will listen to any suggestion.
p250_345.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p250_346.txt|He has made his base in Spain.
p250_348.txt|A Home Office spokesman said.
p250_349.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p250_350.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p250_351.txt|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p250_352.txt|The pain is still acute.
p250_353.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p250_354.txt|It's wonderful to have won.
p250_355.txt|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p250_356.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p250_357.txt|Finally came the moment of truth.
p250_358.txt|We have very limited capacity.
p250_359.txt|Is our children learning ?
p250_360.txt|What form did that take ?
p250_361.txt|Are they free ?
p250_362.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p250_363.txt|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250_364.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p250_365.txt|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p250_366.txt|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p250_367.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p250_368.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p250_369.txt|He had no access to the database.
p250_370.txt|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p250_371.txt|I was delighted to accept.
p250_372.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p250_374.txt|It's fantastic to win again.
p250_375.txt|We are really good friends.
p250_376.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p250_377.txt|Those people must be accountable.
p250_378.txt|She said they would appeal.
p250_379.txt|The countryside is in crisis.
p250_380.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p250_381.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p250_382.txt|She is obviously very disappointed.
p250_383.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250_384.txt|They will fight for everything.
p250_385.txt|We will win the argument.
p250_386.txt|Is it worth it ?
p250_387.txt|Does it matter ?
p250_388.txt|How do you take them away ?
p250_389.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p250_390.txt|After the match, do you ?
p250_391.txt|The team hadn't been picked.
p250_392.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p250_393.txt|One-third of the places are already taken.
p250_394.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p250_395.txt|Everyone could see the joke.
p250_396.txt|The marshall at the turn was great.
p250_397.txt|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p250_398.txt|He has earned the right to their respect.
p250_399.txt|The law would appear to be on our side.
p250_400.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p250_401.txt|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250_402.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p250_403.txt|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250_404.txt|It has only been rumours.
p250_405.txt|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p250_406.txt|Rugby is a hard game.
p250_407.txt|My immune system had been depleted.
p250_408.txt|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p250_409.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p250_410.txt|Growth will come later in the cycle.
p250_411.txt|We're not taking any risks.
p250_412.txt|Neither man has been charged.
p250_413.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p250_414.txt|The choice is strictly personal.
p250_415.txt|It's too close to call.
p250_416.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p250_417.txt|It became a national network.
p250_418.txt|It is a large number.
p250_419.txt|She started to put on weight.
p250_420.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p250_421.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p250_422.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p250_423.txt|Russell is delighted with them.
p250_424.txt|The next few months will tell.
p250_425.txt|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p250_426.txt|The second goal was superb.
p250_427.txt|I am astonished at attack.
p250_428.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p250_429.txt|That was the agreement with the manager.
p250_430.txt|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p250_431.txt|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250_432.txt|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p250_433.txt|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
p250_434.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p250_435.txt|No date has been fixed for his return.
p250_436.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p250_437.txt|The trial will open today.
p250_438.txt|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
p250_439.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p250_440.txt|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p250_441.txt|There were a lot of emotions.
p250_442.txt|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p250_443.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p250_444.txt|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p250_445.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p250_446.txt|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p250_447.txt|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
p250_448.txt|The people around me were fantastic.
p250_449.txt|That will be best for him.
p250_450.txt|And we might go back.
p250_451.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p250_452.txt|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p250_453.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p250_454.txt|The removal would take place in France.
p250_455.txt|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p250_456.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p250_457.txt|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p250_458.txt|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p250_459.txt|The jury is still out.
p250_460.txt|It was like someone had died.
p250_461.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p250_462.txt|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p250_463.txt|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p250_464.txt|The damage is all inside.
p250_465.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p250_466.txt|The boys are mentally focused.
p250_467.txt|This is the stuff of live music.
p250_468.txt|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p250_469.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p250_471.txt|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
p250_472.txt|He certainly did a good job!
p250_473.txt|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p250_474.txt|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
p250_475.txt|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250_476.txt|I have always believed in myself.
p250_477.txt|The chief constable has retired.
p250_478.txt|Well, he is an artist.
p250_479.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p250_480.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p250_481.txt|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p250_482.txt|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p250_483.txt|That argument has been won.
p250_484.txt|It was a narrow escape.
p250_485.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p250_486.txt|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p250_487.txt|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250_488.txt|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p250_489.txt|He is not a dancer.
p250_490.txt|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p250_491.txt|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p250_492.txt|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p250_493.txt|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p250_494.txt|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p250_495.txt|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
p250_496.txt|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p251_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p251_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p251_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p251_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p251_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p251_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p251_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p251_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p251_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p251_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p251_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p251_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p251_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p251_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p251_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p251_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p251_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p251_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p251_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p251_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p251_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p251_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p251_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p251_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p251_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p251_026.txt|But it failed.
p251_027.txt|That's no bad thing.
p251_028.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p251_029.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p251_030.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p251_032.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p251_033.txt|Peace was won.
p251_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p251_035.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p251_036.txt|Was it worth it?
p251_037.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p251_038.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251_039.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p251_040.txt|It was clear.
p251_041.txt|They may be wrong.
p251_042.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p251_043.txt|Dancing was her life.
p251_044.txt|We will push.
p251_045.txt|I feel pretty good.
p251_046.txt|That should do it.
p251_047.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p251_048.txt|As she explains.
p251_049.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251_050.txt|It is the whole package.
p251_051.txt|He had no enemies.
p251_052.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p251_053.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p251_054.txt|I had relied on him.
p251_055.txt|This is a step backwards.
p251_056.txt|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251_057.txt|What was the main difference?
p251_058.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p251_059.txt|It's a real challenge.
p251_060.txt|It is not great art.
p251_061.txt|They're appalled by that.
p251_062.txt|It's that kind of place.
p251_063.txt|It was all in a short period of time.
p251_064.txt|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251_065.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p251_066.txt|He was popular.
p251_067.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p251_068.txt|That was the easy election.
p251_069.txt|There could be a way back.
p251_070.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p251_071.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p251_072.txt|It was chaotic.
p251_073.txt|It is a time bomb.
p251_074.txt|I've not thought about it.
p251_075.txt|Today she has been released.
p251_076.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p251_077.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p251_078.txt|I was too young.
p251_079.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p251_080.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p251_081.txt|War is not the action.
p251_082.txt|You will be.
p251_083.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p251_084.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p251_085.txt|We have turned the corner.
p251_087.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p251_088.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p251_089.txt|We must look forward.
p251_090.txt|It is an old family habit.
p251_091.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p251_092.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p251_093.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p251_094.txt|If you could find it.
p251_095.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p251_096.txt|Journalists should make him.
p251_097.txt|They were outside the circle.
p251_098.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p251_099.txt|That would be unlawful.
p251_100.txt|No date has been set for the appeal.
p251_101.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p251_102.txt|That is no use.
p251_103.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p251_104.txt|Further protests are likely.
p251_105.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p251_106.txt|He was jailed for a year.
p251_107.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p251_108.txt|I came to complete.
p251_109.txt|You had better believe it.
p251_110.txt|I was angry.
p251_111.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p251_112.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p251_113.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p251_114.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p251_115.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p251_116.txt|I joined a group.
p251_117.txt|Does this mean.
p251_118.txt|It is rubbish.
p251_119.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p251_120.txt|We work on the same level.
p251_121.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p251_122.txt|She has been shot.
p251_123.txt|I'm so angry.
p251_124.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p251_125.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p251_126.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p251_127.txt|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p251_128.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p251_129.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p251_130.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p251_131.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p251_132.txt|Government will intervene.
p251_133.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p251_134.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p251_135.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p251_136.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p251_137.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p251_138.txt|Is that it?
p251_139.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p251_140.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p251_141.txt|Three penalties were given.
p251_142.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p251_143.txt|We just had a go.
p251_144.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p251_145.txt|The songs are just so good.
p251_146.txt|It is like a football team.
p251_147.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p251_148.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p251_149.txt|You know the type.
p251_150.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p251_151.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p251_152.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p251_153.txt|It is not normal practice.
p251_154.txt|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p251_155.txt|I knew he was good.
p251_156.txt|I saw one body.
p251_157.txt|There's a pause.
p251_158.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p251_159.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p251_160.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p251_161.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p251_162.txt|We have to move forward.
p251_163.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p251_164.txt|Tell it like it was?
p251_165.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p251_166.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p251_167.txt|You are not going in blind.
p251_168.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p251_169.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p251_170.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p251_171.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p251_172.txt|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p251_173.txt|One season, they might do well.
p251_174.txt|The jury is still out.
p251_175.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p251_176.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p251_177.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p251_178.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p251_179.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p251_180.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p251_181.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p251_182.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p251_183.txt|We did everything by the book.
p251_184.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p251_185.txt|We want to help them through it.
p251_186.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p251_187.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p251_188.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p251_189.txt|People will ask about us.
p251_190.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p251_191.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p251_192.txt|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p251_193.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p251_194.txt|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p251_195.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p251_196.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p251_197.txt|It wasn't to be.
p251_198.txt|It was typical.
p251_199.txt|It's the same old story.
p251_200.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p251_201.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p251_202.txt|There was no option.
p251_203.txt|The conference is the first test.
p251_204.txt|I saw some terrible things.
p251_205.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p251_206.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p251_207.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p251_208.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251_209.txt|Today was first class.
p251_210.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p251_211.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p251_212.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p251_213.txt|Now, it's all right.
p251_214.txt|There was an e-mail.
p251_215.txt|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p251_216.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p251_217.txt|I began to pray.
p251_218.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p251_219.txt|We have got to get it right.
p251_220.txt|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p251_221.txt|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p251_222.txt|Work has started.
p251_223.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p251_224.txt|It's just a place to open it.
p251_225.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p251_226.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p251_227.txt|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p251_228.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p251_230.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p251_231.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p251_232.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p251_233.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p251_234.txt|I am immensely sad.
p251_235.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p251_236.txt|It is a gamble.
p251_237.txt|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p251_238.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p251_239.txt|We were awful.
p251_240.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p251_241.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p251_242.txt|They had no children.
p251_243.txt|It is set in Paris.
p251_244.txt|They should come forward.
p251_245.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p251_246.txt|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251_247.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p251_248.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p251_249.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p251_250.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p251_251.txt|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p251_252.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p251_253.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p251_254.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p251_255.txt|It is hard won.
p251_256.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p251_257.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p251_258.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p251_259.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p251_260.txt|His body was never found.
p251_262.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p251_263.txt|It was a hit.
p251_264.txt|We are ready.
p251_265.txt|They know no other way.
p251_266.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p251_267.txt|We run within the law.
p251_268.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p251_269.txt|Kirkwood was arrested.
p251_270.txt|they fail to engage.
p251_271.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p251_272.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p251_273.txt|I was happily surprised.
p251_274.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p251_275.txt|I am very angry.
p251_276.txt|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p251_278.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p251_279.txt|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p251_280.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p251_281.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p251_282.txt|That's the only thing I will say.
p251_283.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p251_284.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p251_285.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p251_286.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p251_287.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p251_288.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p251_289.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p251_290.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p251_291.txt|We're in shock.
p251_292.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p251_293.txt|One knows the feeling.
p251_294.txt|Things can change.
p251_295.txt|It's a way of life.
p251_296.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p251_297.txt|I am an estate agent.
p251_298.txt|People have no choice.
p251_299.txt|She looked so young.
p251_300.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p251_301.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p251_302.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p251_303.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p251_304.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p251_305.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p251_306.txt|Who will perform?
p251_307.txt|This is a national crisis.
p251_308.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p251_309.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p251_310.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p251_311.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p251_312.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p251_313.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p251_314.txt|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p251_315.txt|A new school will be built.
p251_316.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p251_317.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p251_318.txt|He said she was mad.
p251_319.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p251_320.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p251_321.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p251_322.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p251_323.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p251_324.txt|You are the glory.
p251_325.txt|The letters are going out today.
p251_326.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p251_327.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p251_328.txt|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p251_329.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p251_330.txt|It is out there.
p251_331.txt|They had a confession.
p251_332.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p251_333.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p251_334.txt|That's the law of the land.
p251_335.txt|There was no time scale.
p251_336.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p251_337.txt|It's not long enough.
p251_338.txt|I am so upset.
p251_339.txt|He was not a big name.
p251_340.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p251_341.txt|It could have gone either way.
p251_342.txt|Is that an issue?
p251_343.txt|He can do no wrong.
p251_344.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p251_345.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p251_346.txt|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p251_347.txt|The team for the first game could be this one.
p251_348.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p251_349.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p251_350.txt|He did a good job.
p251_351.txt|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p251_352.txt|Well, it won't.
p251_353.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p251_355.txt|I'm very lucky.
p251_356.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p251_357.txt|The composer will conduct.
p251_359.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p251_360.txt|They got upset.
p251_361.txt|I saw some good things.
p251_362.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p251_364.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p251_365.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p251_366.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p251_367.txt|He has seen the past.
p251_368.txt|We will be homeless.
p251_369.txt|That would help.
p251_372.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p251_373.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p251_374.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p252_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p252_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p252_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p252_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p252_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p252_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p252_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p252_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p252_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p252_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p252_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p252_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p252_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p252_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p252_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p252_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p252_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p252_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p252_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
p252_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p252_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p252_025.txt|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252_026.txt|This would include insurance.
p252_027.txt|It would fit very well with us.
p252_028.txt|He does not even trust his own members.
p252_029.txt|Do not give your details to anyone.
p252_030.txt|Schools do not create that.
p252_032.txt|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252_033.txt|Just look at his fashion sense.
p252_034.txt|I have every confidence.
p252_035.txt|He added that her comments were noted.
p252_036.txt|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252_037.txt|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252_038.txt|That time may never be broken.
p252_039.txt|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252_040.txt|He too started on the subs seats.
p252_041.txt|I'm so happy that she did.
p252_042.txt|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p252_043.txt|This operation will change her life.
p252_044.txt|Something old something new, as it were.
p252_045.txt|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_046.txt|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_047.txt|That's what set him apart.
p252_048.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_050.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_051.txt|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252_052.txt|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252_053.txt|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252_054.txt|Schools will not want change.
p252_055.txt|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252_056.txt|He was failed by his health authority.
p252_057.txt|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252_058.txt|I agree with you about this.
p252_059.txt|Or so he thought.
p252_060.txt|Must be prepared to use it.
p252_061.txt|The fifth was found later.
p252_062.txt|For a decade she was proved right.
p252_063.txt|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_064.txt|Our people are ready.
p252_065.txt|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252_066.txt|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_067.txt|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_068.txt|People come to see the Highlands.
p252_069.txt|It would have to be.
p252_071.txt|This is a great opportunity for us.
p252_072.txt|That is not possible.
p252_073.txt|None has ever been found.
p252_074.txt|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_075.txt|Their time has gone.
p252_076.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p252_077.txt|How are you, sir ?
p252_078.txt|So is that it, then ?
p252_079.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p252_080.txt|What do we do ?
p252_081.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p252_082.txt|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
p252_083.txt|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252_084.txt|He has a real potential.
p252_085.txt|LET there be light.
p252_086.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252_087.txt|Scotland has great assets.
p252_088.txt|That remains the same.
p252_089.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p252_090.txt|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p252_091.txt|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252_092.txt|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p252_093.txt|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252_094.txt|The car driver died.
p252_095.txt|It looks that way.
p252_096.txt|Now comes the hard part.
p252_097.txt|We are already seeing some positive results.
p252_098.txt|We're at home, which is important.
p252_099.txt|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252_100.txt|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p252_101.txt|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252_102.txt|They had three children.
p252_103.txt|Some young girls also came by last night.
p252_104.txt|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p252_105.txt|It would be easy to think so.
p252_106.txt|And so it went on.
p252_108.txt|Scotland were on Saturday.
p252_109.txt|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252_110.txt|He gets his moment.
p252_111.txt|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p252_112.txt|There was no reason.
p252_113.txt|It gets too much.
p252_114.txt|So they should be.
p252_115.txt|No progress has been made.
p252_116.txt|They need the money.
p252_117.txt|That is the only way to rate players.
p252_118.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252_119.txt|Its failure is no surprise.
p252_120.txt|No country has a similar training programme.
p252_121.txt|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p252_122.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p252_123.txt|They pointed to the site.
p252_124.txt|Tony Blair said as little.
p252_125.txt|He is at peace with himself.
p252_126.txt|Gold admitted as much.
p252_127.txt|It seemed like four hours.
p252_128.txt|Evidence must not be held back.
p252_129.txt|We beat the Welsh team.
p252_130.txt|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252_131.txt|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252_132.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p252_133.txt|Eight others have followed.
p252_134.txt|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_135.txt|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p252_136.txt|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_137.txt|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252_138.txt|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p252_139.txt|It should have its own network.
p252_140.txt|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p252_141.txt|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252_142.txt|That shows the impact it had.
p252_143.txt|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p252_144.txt|I'd always wanted to act.
p252_145.txt|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_146.txt|That is a big risk at any price.
p252_147.txt|I am never fully fit.
p252_148.txt|Are you going to win ?
p252_149.txt|Was it the wife ?
p252_150.txt|Why change it ?
p252_151.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p252_152.txt|Does the name matter ?
p252_153.txt|how do you get it back ?
p252_154.txt|What are you not good at ?
p252_155.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p252_156.txt|Who was she ?
p252_157.txt|He said some things which were better left alone.
p252_158.txt|He nearly killed my son.
p252_160.txt|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252_161.txt|I told them during their morning break.
p252_162.txt|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_163.txt|Mr Dewar understood that.
p252_164.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p252_165.txt|They have shown great character.
p252_166.txt|I am secure in my own position.
p252_167.txt|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252_168.txt|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_169.txt|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p252_170.txt|The second failed completely.
p252_171.txt|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252_172.txt|We have come a long way since then.
p252_173.txt|Sport is good for you.
p252_174.txt|It was clearly not a battle.
p252_175.txt|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252_176.txt|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_177.txt|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252_178.txt|All options are available.
p252_179.txt|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252_181.txt|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_182.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p252_183.txt|I've no idea how it works.
p252_184.txt|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252_185.txt|Maybe this battle had been.
p252_186.txt|Art can challenge our value system.
p252_187.txt|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252_188.txt|London remained the favourite.
p252_189.txt|I've never had a year like this.
p252_190.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252_191.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p252_193.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252_194.txt|A child is not a product.
p252_195.txt|Which can happen any time.
p252_196.txt|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p252_197.txt|Now he is back on top again.
p252_198.txt|The hotel was huge.
p252_199.txt|And they were being paid ?
p252_200.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p252_201.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p252_202.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p252_203.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p252_204.txt|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p252_205.txt|This should begin in October.
p252_206.txt|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p252_207.txt|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p252_208.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p252_209.txt|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_210.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p252_211.txt|Their bodies were never found.
p252_212.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p252_213.txt|Business will continue as usual.
p252_214.txt|I want a free vote.
p252_215.txt|Fine, said the press officer.
p252_216.txt|The questions came quick and fast.
p252_217.txt|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252_218.txt|Her experience is certainly limited.
p252_219.txt|We tried four banks.
p252_220.txt|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p252_221.txt|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p252_222.txt|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_223.txt|Brian was last to join.
p252_224.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p252_225.txt|Now the door has opened.
p252_226.txt|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p252_227.txt|Her death is a huge blow.
p252_228.txt|The global market was about flat.
p252_229.txt|Three hit the target.
p252_230.txt|The idea is simple.
p252_231.txt|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p252_232.txt|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252_233.txt|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252_234.txt|We know the problems.
p252_235.txt|Britain will be little affected.
p252_236.txt|There is a good reason for this.
p252_237.txt|You know the type.
p252_238.txt|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252_239.txt|The board do not own the company.
p252_240.txt|That time is not far away.
p252_241.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p252_242.txt|When I was training.
p252_243.txt|I did let myself down a bit.
p252_244.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p252_245.txt|This is absolutely not true.
p252_246.txt|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p252_247.txt|It was a great evening.
p252_248.txt|We have several options.
p252_250.txt|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_251.txt|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252_252.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252_253.txt|It is based on population rather than need.
p252_254.txt|We were leading by two goals.
p252_255.txt|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p252_256.txt|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_258.txt|It was an accident.
p252_260.txt|My goals have never changed.
p252_262.txt|So we kept them waiting.
p252_263.txt|He makes time for everyone.
p252_264.txt|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252_265.txt|The proposal was rejected.
p252_266.txt|Look at a computer.
p252_267.txt|He did better then.
p252_268.txt|But the next day she paid for it.
p252_269.txt|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p252_270.txt|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_271.txt|This was the perfect setting.
p252_273.txt|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p252_274.txt|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252_275.txt|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p252_276.txt|All films open tomorrow
p252_277.txt|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p252_278.txt|Paul never gave up hope.
p252_279.txt|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_280.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p252_281.txt|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252_282.txt|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252_283.txt|It is a dangerous sport.
p252_284.txt|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_286.txt|The future might well be green after all.
p252_287.txt|They were seriously after him.
p252_288.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p252_289.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p252_290.txt|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_291.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p252_292.txt|His season started this afternoon.
p252_293.txt|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p252_294.txt|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_295.txt|Kenny and I are ready.
p252_296.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p252_297.txt|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_298.txt|They have played their part.
p252_299.txt|He followed the Italian route.
p252_300.txt|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252_301.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p252_302.txt|So does every industry.
p252_303.txt|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252_304.txt|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252_305.txt|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252_306.txt|We must move on.
p252_307.txt|It's just an area of water.
p252_308.txt|We have achieved that.
p252_309.txt|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252_310.txt|Good players have become bad.
p252_311.txt|Many events are down on numbers.
p252_312.txt|He had served his time.
p252_313.txt|It was a total surprise.
p252_314.txt|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_315.txt|The process will start tomorrow.
p252_316.txt|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_317.txt|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p252_319.txt|One finding emerged clearly.
p252_320.txt|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252_321.txt|We lost to a poor team.
p252_322.txt|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p252_323.txt|We have clearly become well established.
p252_324.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p252_325.txt|Murray plays down return
p252_326.txt|Other teams moved up too.
p252_327.txt|Not one person spoke badly.
p252_328.txt|We were caught out.
p252_329.txt|The performance continues to improve.
p252_330.txt|We want immediate action.
p252_331.txt|Our relationship has been very good.
p252_332.txt|Someone should tell them.
p252_333.txt|But it won't help British farmers.
p252_334.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p252_335.txt|Did it work ?
p252_336.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p252_337.txt|Is our children learning ?
p252_338.txt|How independent is that ?
p252_339.txt|Because I think it's there.
p252_340.txt|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252_341.txt|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252_342.txt|They will now remain split up.
p252_343.txt|We are a husband and wife team.
p252_344.txt|It was the September weekend after all.
p252_345.txt|He would add value.
p252_346.txt|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p252_347.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p252_348.txt|That was our last chance to do something.
p252_349.txt|Maybe she is right.
p252_350.txt|I saw one man vote five times.
p252_351.txt|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p252_352.txt|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_353.txt|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_354.txt|Any increase always has some effect.
p252_355.txt|What form did that take ?
p252_356.txt|Are they free ?
p252_357.txt|What are they for ?
p252_358.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p252_359.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p252_360.txt|They had better be.
p252_361.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252_362.txt|He was a great human being.
p252_363.txt|That seems highly unlikely.
p252_364.txt|Still, I am delighted.
p252_365.txt|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252_366.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252_367.txt|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_368.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p252_369.txt|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252_370.txt|The whole system is too complex.
p252_371.txt|He said legal action could be considered.
p252_372.txt|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_373.txt|This is far too high.
p252_374.txt|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_375.txt|If you believe in the blue and white.
p252_376.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p252_378.txt|The referee faces a massive job.
p252_379.txt|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252_380.txt|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252_381.txt|An appeal was unlikely.
p252_382.txt|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252_383.txt|I got dropped for that game.
p252_384.txt|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_385.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p252_386.txt|This year I understood.
p252_387.txt|It's clearly a budget.
p252_388.txt|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252_389.txt|The women are victims here.
p252_390.txt|I'm not sure that's right.
p252_391.txt|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_392.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p252_393.txt|There's nothing natural left.
p252_394.txt|He could still be President.
p252_395.txt|There's always a case.
p252_396.txt|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p252_397.txt|He has worked hard over the years.
p252_399.txt|It was too difficult.
p252_400.txt|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252_401.txt|I managed to do that.
p252_402.txt|So what happens next ?
p252_403.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p252_404.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p252_405.txt|Is it worth it ?
p252_406.txt|Does it matter ?
p252_407.txt|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_408.txt|They had to have hospital treatment.
p252_409.txt|Five local people were injured.
p252_410.txt|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252_411.txt|I'd like to report a murder.
p253_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p253_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p253_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p253_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p253_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p253_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p253_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p253_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p253_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p253_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p253_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p253_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p253_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p253_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p253_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p253_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p253_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p253_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p253_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p253_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p253_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p253_025.txt|But it failed.
p253_026.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p253_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p253_028.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p253_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p253_030.txt|This is the window.
p253_031.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p253_032.txt|Help is needed.
p253_033.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p253_034.txt|It is marvellous.
p253_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p253_036.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p253_037.txt|They're just different.
p253_038.txt|It was clear.
p253_039.txt|Indeed, he does.
p253_040.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p253_041.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p253_042.txt|Dancing was her life.
p253_043.txt|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253_044.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p253_045.txt|They want to be entertained.
p253_046.txt|It's the only thing.
p253_047.txt|You had better believe it.
p253_048.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p253_049.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p253_050.txt|A neighbour said.
p253_051.txt|It is bizarre.
p253_052.txt|There is no reason at all.
p253_053.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p253_054.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p253_055.txt|Our people are ready.
p253_056.txt|Here's a clue.
p253_057.txt|I was lost.
p253_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p253_059.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p253_060.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253_061.txt|It is unique.
p253_062.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p253_063.txt|It happened so quickly.
p253_064.txt|That's the truth.
p253_065.txt|It seems to have worked.
p253_066.txt|This is the first step.
p253_067.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p253_068.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253_069.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p253_071.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p253_072.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p253_073.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253_074.txt|It could take some time.
p253_075.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p253_076.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p253_077.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p253_078.txt|The party is up for it.
p253_079.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p253_080.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p253_081.txt|What has changed?
p253_082.txt|I will miss him.
p253_083.txt|He is in the queue.
p253_084.txt|I first met him last summer.
p253_085.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p253_086.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p253_087.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p253_088.txt|They lived for their children.
p253_089.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p253_090.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p253_091.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p253_092.txt|We are on the path of change.
p253_093.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p253_095.txt|Yet, it worked.
p253_096.txt|He's been hit by it.
p253_097.txt|I love the Dome.
p253_098.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p253_099.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p253_100.txt|It is a love affair.
p253_101.txt|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p253_102.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p253_103.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p253_104.txt|That would be unlawful.
p253_106.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p253_107.txt|It was an adventure.
p253_108.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p253_109.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p253_110.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p253_111.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p253_112.txt|Is that right?
p253_113.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p253_114.txt|It's a shame.
p253_115.txt|It was the eighties.
p253_116.txt|It is so sad.
p253_117.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p253_118.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p253_119.txt|It is rubbish.
p253_120.txt|Who would be a referee?
p253_121.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p253_122.txt|We enjoyed it today.
p253_123.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p253_124.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p253_125.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p253_126.txt|I'm so angry.
p253_127.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p253_128.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253_129.txt|It's not a U-turn.
p253_130.txt|No production was achieved.
p253_131.txt|I am now unemployed.
p253_132.txt|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p253_133.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p253_134.txt|We work well together.
p253_135.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p253_136.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p253_138.txt|I was dead.
p253_139.txt|I don't know the full story.
p253_140.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p253_141.txt|She died at her home.
p253_142.txt|He realises his mistake.
p253_143.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p253_144.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p253_145.txt|I was awful.
p253_146.txt|Who would have?
p253_147.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p253_148.txt|It is not just about pay.
p253_149.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p253_150.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p253_151.txt|I was stunned.
p253_152.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p253_153.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p253_154.txt|They have not been named.
p253_156.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p253_157.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p253_158.txt|Words were not required.
p253_160.txt|Life becomes a song.
p253_161.txt|Well, he should know.
p253_162.txt|Was this element always there?
p253_163.txt|These days are long gone.
p253_164.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p253_165.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p253_167.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p253_168.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p253_169.txt|We have a budget in March.
p253_170.txt|We should do everything at a stroke.
p253_171.txt|You had to go and see him.
p253_173.txt|In a way he was.
p253_175.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p253_176.txt|As we worked.
p253_177.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p253_178.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p253_179.txt|The goals were good.
p253_180.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p253_181.txt|It's an idea.
p253_182.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p253_183.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p253_184.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p253_185.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p253_186.txt|Does this matter?
p253_187.txt|Our team is just so young.
p253_188.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p253_189.txt|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p253_190.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p253_191.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p253_192.txt|We speak about the performance.
p253_194.txt|Peace was won.
p253_195.txt|It's a fact.
p253_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p253_197.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p253_198.txt|Is that success?
p253_199.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p253_200.txt|Who will pay for this?
p253_201.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p253_202.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p253_203.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p253_205.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p253_206.txt|Feel the heat?
p253_207.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p253_208.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p253_209.txt|It had all been arranged.
p253_211.txt|Work has started.
p253_212.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p253_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p253_214.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p253_215.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p253_216.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p253_217.txt|Then another one came.
p253_218.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p253_219.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p253_220.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p253_221.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p253_222.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p253_223.txt|It's not before time.
p253_224.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p253_225.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p253_226.txt|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p253_227.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p253_228.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p253_229.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p253_230.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p253_231.txt|We are so proud.
p253_232.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p253_233.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p253_234.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p253_235.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p253_236.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p253_237.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p253_238.txt|It is hard won.
p253_239.txt|Our policy is clear.
p253_240.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p253_241.txt|The scene is about this?
p253_242.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p253_243.txt|My son was too young to die.
p253_244.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p253_245.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p253_247.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p253_248.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p253_249.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p253_250.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p253_251.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p253_252.txt|they fail to engage.
p253_253.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p253_254.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253_255.txt|They must play for each other.
p253_256.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p253_257.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p253_258.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p253_260.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p253_261.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p253_262.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p253_263.txt|He was also married with two children.
p253_264.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p253_265.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p253_266.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p253_267.txt|One knows the feeling.
p253_268.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p253_269.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p253_270.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p253_271.txt|She failed in her action.
p253_272.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p253_273.txt|She looked so young.
p253_274.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p253_275.txt|It's so awful.
p253_276.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p253_277.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p253_278.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p253_279.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p253_280.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p253_281.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p253_282.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p253_283.txt|Who will perform?
p253_285.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p253_287.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p253_288.txt|I was the sheep.
p253_289.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p253_290.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p253_291.txt|Nothing is safe.
p253_292.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p253_293.txt|One was a lawyer.
p253_294.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p253_296.txt|They are wrong.
p253_297.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p253_298.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p253_299.txt|It could work.
p253_300.txt|This is a war over our home.
p253_301.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p253_302.txt|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p253_303.txt|You should be.
p253_304.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p253_305.txt|The letters are going out today.
p253_307.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p253_308.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p253_309.txt|She is very distinctive.
p253_310.txt|We have got to get the points from this one.
p253_311.txt|You may have a short memory.
p253_313.txt|We are in the end game.
p253_314.txt|It will work.
p253_316.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p253_317.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p253_318.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p253_319.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p253_320.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p253_322.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p253_323.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p253_324.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p253_326.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p253_327.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p253_328.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p253_329.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p253_330.txt|I've got no secret.
p253_331.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p253_332.txt|This is a friendly match?
p253_333.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p253_334.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p253_335.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p253_336.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p253_337.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p253_338.txt|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p253_339.txt|She is free.
p253_340.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p253_341.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p253_342.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p253_343.txt|Yet he left a few days later.
p253_344.txt|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p253_345.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p253_346.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p253_348.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p253_349.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p253_350.txt|That would help.
p253_351.txt|My husband was angry.
p253_352.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p253_354.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p253_355.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p253_356.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p253_357.txt|Their time has gone.
p253_358.txt|He could make it.
p253_359.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p253_360.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p253_361.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p253_363.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p253_364.txt|It is a simple equation.
p253_365.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p253_366.txt|It was a funny game.
p253_367.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p253_368.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p253_369.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p253_371.txt|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p253_372.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p253_373.txt|Something is wrong.
p253_374.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p253_375.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p253_376.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p253_377.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p253_378.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p253_379.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p253_380.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p253_381.txt|It's a real problem.
p253_382.txt|It's just outrageous.
p253_383.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p253_384.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p253_385.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p253_386.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p253_387.txt|They are good.
p253_388.txt|I'm glad I came.
p253_390.txt|I've had my time.
p253_391.txt|It will take place in July.
p253_392.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253_394.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p253_397.txt|What would be the point?
p253_399.txt|It might be.
p253_400.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p253_401.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p253_402.txt|He got his degree.
p253_403.txt|went on sale.
p253_404.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p253_405.txt|Until they came to do it.
p253_407.txt|That may be.
p253_408.txt|It is legally binding.
p253_409.txt|We went straight into the bedroom.
p253_410.txt|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p254_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p254_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p254_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p254_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p254_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p254_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p254_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p254_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p254_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p254_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p254_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p254_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p254_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p254_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p254_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p254_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p254_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p254_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p254_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p254_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p254_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p254_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p254_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p254_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p254_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p254_026.txt|But it failed.
p254_027.txt|They may be wrong.
p254_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p254_029.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254_030.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254_031.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_032.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p254_033.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p254_034.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254_035.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p254_037.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p254_038.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254_039.txt|They're just different.
p254_040.txt|It was clear.
p254_041.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p254_042.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_043.txt|I was scared.
p254_044.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p254_045.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p254_046.txt|That period was a struggle.
p254_047.txt|I am just going to go for it.
p254_048.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254_049.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p254_050.txt|It's a crucial award.
p254_051.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_052.txt|That should do it.
p254_053.txt|It's a blessing.
p254_054.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p254_055.txt|But it might have done.
p254_056.txt|That time has passed.
p254_057.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p254_058.txt|He is too weak to move.
p254_059.txt|Life is good.
p254_060.txt|It is the whole package.
p254_061.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p254_062.txt|He had no enemies.
p254_063.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p254_064.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_065.txt|That's the day job.
p254_066.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p254_067.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_068.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_069.txt|My mother is a widow.
p254_070.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p254_071.txt|Jobs could go.
p254_072.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p254_073.txt|They're appalled by that.
p254_074.txt|There was a battle there.
p254_075.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p254_076.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_078.txt|They never gave up hope.
p254_079.txt|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_080.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p254_081.txt|It's all I can do.
p254_082.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p254_083.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p254_084.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p254_085.txt|My office is bare.
p254_086.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p254_087.txt|There was an e-mail.
p254_088.txt|Even the one she loved.
p254_090.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_091.txt|It may well have been.
p254_092.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254_093.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254_094.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p254_095.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254_096.txt|All options are open.
p254_097.txt|You will be.
p254_098.txt|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p254_099.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p254_100.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p254_101.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p254_102.txt|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p254_103.txt|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254_104.txt|I love the Dome.
p254_105.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p254_106.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254_107.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p254_108.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p254_109.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p254_110.txt|He takes the job.
p254_111.txt|It was an adventure.
p254_112.txt|That all hope is never lost.
p254_113.txt|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254_114.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p254_115.txt|It is normal.
p254_116.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p254_117.txt|We need to handle it.
p254_118.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p254_119.txt|It's a long process.
p254_120.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p254_121.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p254_122.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254_123.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254_124.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254_125.txt|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254_126.txt|I joined a group.
p254_127.txt|Does this mean.
p254_128.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254_129.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p254_130.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254_131.txt|I'm so angry.
p254_132.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254_133.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254_134.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254_135.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254_136.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254_137.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p254_138.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p254_139.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p254_140.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p254_141.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254_143.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p254_144.txt|Three penalties were given.
p254_145.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p254_146.txt|He is severe.
p254_147.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p254_148.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p254_149.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p254_150.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254_151.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254_152.txt|It is not just about pay.
p254_153.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254_154.txt|You know the type.
p254_155.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p254_156.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254_157.txt|I was in daily contact.
p254_158.txt|We will turn the corner.
p254_159.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p254_160.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p254_161.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p254_162.txt|He's a nice guy.
p254_163.txt|It has to be now.
p254_164.txt|They are not advertised.
p254_165.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p254_166.txt|Tell it like it was?
p254_167.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p254_168.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p254_169.txt|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_170.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p254_171.txt|He was a crazy man.
p254_172.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p254_173.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p254_174.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p254_175.txt|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p254_176.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p254_177.txt|The clarity is vital.
p254_178.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p254_179.txt|Tony had arrived.
p254_180.txt|He will need that machine.
p254_181.txt|I was totally wrong.
p254_182.txt|We did everything by the book.
p254_183.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p254_184.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p254_185.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p254_186.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p254_187.txt|Peace was won.
p254_188.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p254_189.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p254_190.txt|Off I went.
p254_191.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254_192.txt|Is that it?
p254_193.txt|The conference is the first test.
p254_194.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p254_195.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254_196.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p254_197.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p254_198.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254_199.txt|Today was first class.
p254_200.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254_201.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p254_202.txt|It's like a garage.
p254_203.txt|But I am a worried man.
p254_204.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254_205.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p254_206.txt|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254_207.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p254_208.txt|I began to pray.
p254_209.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p254_210.txt|His third goal was superb.
p254_211.txt|It's not ideal.
p254_212.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p254_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p254_214.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254_215.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254_216.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p254_217.txt|You have to do your research.
p254_218.txt|Saturday is gone.
p254_219.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p254_220.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p254_221.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254_222.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p254_223.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p254_224.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p254_225.txt|It's so special.
p254_226.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254_227.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p254_228.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p254_229.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p254_230.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p254_231.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p254_232.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p254_233.txt|They should come forward.
p254_234.txt|It is not the message alone.
p254_235.txt|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p254_236.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254_237.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p254_238.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p254_239.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p254_240.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p254_241.txt|They are all bright and different.
p254_242.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p254_243.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p254_244.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254_245.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p254_246.txt|He got the same story.
p254_247.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254_248.txt|I was shocked.
p254_249.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p254_250.txt|There's the mix.
p254_251.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p254_252.txt|This year I understood.
p254_253.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p254_254.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p254_255.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p254_256.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254_257.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254_258.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p254_259.txt|It is also very valuable.
p254_260.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254_261.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254_262.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254_263.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p254_264.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p254_265.txt|There is no link.
p254_266.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p254_267.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254_268.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p254_269.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p254_270.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p254_271.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p254_272.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p254_273.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p254_275.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254_276.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p254_277.txt|It's a way of life.
p254_278.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p254_279.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254_280.txt|People have no choice.
p254_281.txt|If not, he should go home.
p254_282.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p254_283.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254_284.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254_285.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p254_286.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p254_287.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p254_289.txt|The mood is good.
p254_290.txt|It's like a high school play.
p254_291.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254_292.txt|This is a national crisis.
p254_293.txt|Well, he can do it.
p254_294.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p254_295.txt|That could change.
p254_296.txt|Who can predict?
p254_297.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p254_298.txt|One was a lawyer.
p254_299.txt|It is a road of death.
p254_300.txt|The plot is minimal.
p254_301.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254_302.txt|I did not name it.
p254_303.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p254_304.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254_305.txt|They were fantastic.
p254_306.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p254_307.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p254_308.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p254_309.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p254_310.txt|It is out there.
p254_311.txt|He said she was mad.
p254_312.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p254_313.txt|We are in the end game.
p254_314.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254_315.txt|It is a strong case.
p254_316.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p254_317.txt|Donald was his friend.
p254_318.txt|He was not a big name.
p254_319.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p254_320.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p254_321.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p254_322.txt|It's not long enough.
p254_323.txt|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254_324.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254_326.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p254_327.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254_329.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_330.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p254_331.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p254_332.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254_333.txt|Today she has been released.
p254_334.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254_335.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p254_336.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p254_337.txt|It should be scrapped.
p254_338.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254_339.txt|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_340.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p254_341.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p254_342.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p254_343.txt|It is long gone.
p254_344.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254_345.txt|Tell us about it.
p254_346.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p254_347.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p254_348.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p254_349.txt|It was very formal.
p254_350.txt|I kept going for her.
p254_351.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p254_352.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254_353.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254_354.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254_355.txt|We will be homeless.
p254_356.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p254_357.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p254_358.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254_359.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254_360.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254_361.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254_362.txt|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254_363.txt|There was no option.
p254_364.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p254_365.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p254_366.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254_367.txt|They received a reply from their own managers.
p254_368.txt|But I managed.
p254_369.txt|Five members were disciplined.
p254_370.txt|Talks are progressing.
p254_371.txt|They play together perfectly.
p254_372.txt|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_373.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p254_374.txt|It became a national network.
p254_375.txt|It is a large number.
p254_376.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p254_377.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254_378.txt|He has the edge.
p254_379.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p254_380.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254_381.txt|Face to face
p254_382.txt|I am very happy with life.
p254_383.txt|I'm just enjoying every match.
p254_384.txt|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254_385.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254_386.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254_387.txt|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254_388.txt|They really did a great job.
p254_389.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p254_390.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p254_391.txt|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_392.txt|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254_393.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p254_394.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254_395.txt|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254_396.txt|We're looking for justice.
p254_397.txt|I can lead by example.
p254_398.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p254_399.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254_400.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p254_401.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p254_402.txt|The car was just there.
p254_403.txt|It was on fire.
p255_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p255_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p255_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p255_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p255_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p255_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p255_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p255_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p255_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p255_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p255_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p255_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p255_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p255_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p255_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p255_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p255_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p255_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p255_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p255_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p255_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p255_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p255_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p255_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p255_025.txt|He has not been named.
p255_026.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p255_027.txt|They should be so lucky.
p255_028.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p255_029.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p255_030.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p255_031.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p255_032.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p255_033.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p255_034.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p255_035.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p255_036.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p255_037.txt|Dancing was her life.
p255_038.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255_039.txt|It is a memorial.
p255_040.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p255_041.txt|But it might have done.
p255_042.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p255_043.txt|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p255_044.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p255_045.txt|She looked so young.
p255_046.txt|Life is good.
p255_047.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255_048.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p255_049.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p255_050.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p255_051.txt|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p255_052.txt|It's very odd.
p255_053.txt|Because we do not need it.
p255_054.txt|That's the truth.
p255_055.txt|My mother is a widow.
p255_057.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255_058.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p255_059.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p255_060.txt|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p255_061.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p255_062.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255_063.txt|We should have known.
p255_064.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p255_065.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p255_066.txt|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255_067.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p255_068.txt|There could be a way back.
p255_069.txt|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p255_070.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p255_071.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p255_072.txt|It works for us.
p255_073.txt|He is now resident in England.
p255_074.txt|I've got the shirt.
p255_075.txt|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255_076.txt|What has changed?
p255_077.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p255_078.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p255_079.txt|He is driven.
p255_080.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p255_081.txt|We have other options.
p255_082.txt|We want to know about the policy.
p255_083.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p255_084.txt|It's never too late.
p255_085.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p255_086.txt|We do not get that impression now.
p255_087.txt|It is a lifeline.
p255_088.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p255_089.txt|They've got to account for it.
p255_090.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p255_091.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p255_092.txt|We could not get any possession.
p255_093.txt|If you could find it.
p255_094.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p255_095.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p255_096.txt|Get to know him.
p255_097.txt|May not have been at fault?
p255_098.txt|I had a ball today.
p255_099.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p255_100.txt|That time is not now, however.
p255_101.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p255_102.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p255_103.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p255_104.txt|Further protests are likely.
p255_105.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p255_106.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p255_107.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p255_108.txt|He was jailed for a year.
p255_109.txt|I came to complete.
p255_110.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p255_111.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p255_112.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p255_113.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p255_114.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p255_115.txt|I joined a group.
p255_116.txt|Does this mean.
p255_117.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p255_118.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p255_119.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p255_120.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p255_121.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p255_122.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p255_123.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p255_124.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p255_125.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p255_126.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p255_127.txt|It will be too hot.
p255_128.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p255_129.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p255_130.txt|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p255_131.txt|Our intentions are real.
p255_132.txt|It is also well received.
p255_133.txt|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p255_134.txt|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p255_135.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p255_136.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p255_137.txt|I saw some terrible things.
p255_138.txt|It's a question of fashion.
p255_139.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p255_140.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p255_141.txt|We have got to get it right.
p255_142.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p255_143.txt|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p255_144.txt|Who would be right?
p255_145.txt|She died at her home.
p255_146.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p255_147.txt|I was awful.
p255_148.txt|The idea is simple.
p255_149.txt|It is like a football team.
p255_150.txt|It would be a last resort.
p255_151.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
p255_152.txt|It is not just about pay.
p255_153.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p255_154.txt|We shall not be moved.
p255_155.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p255_156.txt|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p255_157.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p255_158.txt|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p255_159.txt|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p255_160.txt|Work has started.
p255_161.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p255_162.txt|And sooner than we may think.
p255_163.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p255_164.txt|It is so unfair.
p255_165.txt|I will tell you.
p255_166.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p255_167.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p255_168.txt|We have to move forward.
p255_169.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p255_170.txt|I lost my head.
p255_171.txt|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p255_172.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p255_173.txt|You are not going in blind.
p255_174.txt|They will do their own thing.
p255_175.txt|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p255_176.txt|You had to go and see him.
p255_177.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p255_178.txt|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p255_179.txt|His team management was protective.
p255_180.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p255_181.txt|The jury is still out.
p255_182.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p255_183.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p255_184.txt|And I saw the light!
p255_185.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p255_186.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p255_187.txt|Tony had arrived.
p255_188.txt|It is the whole package.
p255_189.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p255_190.txt|The goals were good.
p255_191.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p255_192.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p255_193.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p255_194.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p255_195.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p255_196.txt|They are now divorced.
p255_197.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p255_198.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p255_199.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p255_200.txt|It is a farce.
p255_201.txt|I am totally surprised.
p255_202.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p255_203.txt|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p255_204.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p255_205.txt|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p255_206.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p255_207.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p255_208.txt|It's just awful.
p255_209.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p255_210.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p255_211.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p255_212.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p255_213.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p255_214.txt|He knows a lot.
p255_215.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p255_216.txt|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p255_217.txt|I had relied on him.
p255_218.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p255_219.txt|His third goal was superb.
p255_220.txt|It's been a good year.
p255_221.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p255_222.txt|It's not ideal.
p255_223.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p255_224.txt|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p255_225.txt|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p255_226.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p255_227.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p255_228.txt|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p255_229.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p255_230.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p255_231.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p255_232.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p255_233.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p255_234.txt|Our numbers are small.
p255_235.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p255_236.txt|It's like a basketball.
p255_237.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p255_238.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p255_239.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p255_240.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p255_241.txt|It is mainstream.
p255_242.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p255_243.txt|We were awful.
p255_244.txt|They had no children.
p255_245.txt|It is set in Paris.
p255_246.txt|It is not the message alone.
p255_247.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p255_248.txt|It has been declared.
p255_249.txt|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p255_250.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p255_251.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p255_252.txt|It's only fair.
p255_253.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p255_254.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p255_255.txt|His body was never found.
p255_256.txt|There's the mix.
p255_257.txt|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p255_258.txt|I can't get a job.
p255_259.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p255_260.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p255_261.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p255_262.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p255_263.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p255_264.txt|I am very angry.
p255_265.txt|They must play for each other.
p255_266.txt|He can do everything.
p255_267.txt|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p255_268.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p255_269.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p255_270.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p255_271.txt|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p255_272.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p255_273.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p255_274.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p255_275.txt|He was popular.
p255_276.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p255_277.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p255_278.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p255_279.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p255_280.txt|One knows the feeling.
p255_281.txt|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255_282.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p255_283.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p255_284.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p255_285.txt|This is a national crisis.
p255_286.txt|The death toll included five children.
p255_287.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p255_288.txt|So I did.
p255_289.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p255_290.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p255_292.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p255_293.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p255_294.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p255_295.txt|Who can predict?
p255_296.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p255_297.txt|A new school will be built.
p255_298.txt|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
p255_299.txt|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p255_300.txt|Graeme was prepared.
p255_301.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p255_302.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p255_303.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p255_304.txt|they fail to engage.
p255_305.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p255_306.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p255_307.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p255_308.txt|It's certainly different.
p255_309.txt|Is there on his hands?
p255_310.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p255_311.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p255_312.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p255_313.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p255_314.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p255_315.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p255_316.txt|Henman has been warned.
p255_317.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p255_318.txt|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p255_319.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p255_320.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p255_321.txt|There was some merit in that.
p255_322.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p255_323.txt|That's the law of the land.
p255_324.txt|They will be destroyed.
p255_325.txt|It is a strong case.
p255_326.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p255_327.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p255_328.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p255_329.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p255_330.txt|It could have gone either way.
p255_331.txt|It is a time bomb.
p255_332.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p255_333.txt|It can be halted.
p255_334.txt|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p255_335.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p255_336.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p255_337.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p255_338.txt|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255_339.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p255_340.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p255_341.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p255_342.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p255_343.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p255_344.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p255_345.txt|This is a friendly match?
p255_346.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p255_347.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p255_348.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p255_349.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p255_350.txt|I kept going for her.
p255_351.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p255_352.txt|He's very explosive.
p255_353.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p255_354.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p255_355.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p255_356.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p255_357.txt|We will be homeless.
p255_358.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p255_359.txt|We are looking for perfection.
p255_360.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p255_361.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p255_362.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p255_363.txt|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p255_364.txt|Not so, it seems.
p255_365.txt|Tell it like it was?
p255_366.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p255_367.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p255_368.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p255_369.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p255_370.txt|They received a reply from their own managers.
p255_371.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p255_372.txt|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p255_373.txt|It's a long process.
p255_374.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p255_375.txt|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p255_376.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p255_377.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p255_378.txt|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p255_379.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p255_380.txt|The casualties were not named.
p255_381.txt|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p256_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p256_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p256_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p256_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p256_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p256_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p256_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p256_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p256_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p256_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p256_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p256_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p256_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p256_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p256_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p256_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p256_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p256_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p256_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p256_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p256_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p256_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p256_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p256_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p256_025.txt|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p256_026.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p256_027.txt|I have a theory.
p256_028.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p256_029.txt|There's a story, too.
p256_030.txt|I was an athlete.
p256_031.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p256_032.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256_033.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p256_034.txt|A web site is planned for November.
p256_035.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256_036.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256_037.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p256_038.txt|They're just different.
p256_039.txt|It's a real threat.
p256_040.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p256_041.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p256_042.txt|Indeed, he does.
p256_043.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p256_044.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p256_045.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p256_046.txt|That period was a struggle.
p256_047.txt|A neighbour said.
p256_048.txt|It's a crucial award.
p256_049.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p256_050.txt|It's a blessing.
p256_051.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p256_052.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p256_053.txt|I would love to have him home.
p256_054.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256_055.txt|He had no enemies.
p256_056.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p256_057.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256_058.txt|It is unique.
p256_059.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256_060.txt|That's the truth.
p256_061.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p256_062.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p256_063.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p256_064.txt|And a film maker was born.
p256_065.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p256_066.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p256_067.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p256_068.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p256_069.txt|There was a battle there.
p256_070.txt|They are real.
p256_071.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p256_072.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p256_073.txt|It should be devolved.
p256_074.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p256_075.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p256_076.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p256_077.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p256_078.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p256_079.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p256_080.txt|It is a terrible place.
p256_081.txt|I've got the shirt.
p256_082.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p256_083.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p256_084.txt|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p256_085.txt|It may well have been.
p256_086.txt|I first met him last summer.
p256_087.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p256_088.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p256_089.txt|It's never too late.
p256_090.txt|It was nice.
p256_091.txt|We do not get that impression now.
p256_092.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p256_093.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p256_094.txt|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256_095.txt|We must look forward.
p256_096.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p256_097.txt|They've got to account for it.
p256_098.txt|She told The Herald.
p256_099.txt|It was clear.
p256_100.txt|There was no rescue.
p256_101.txt|We could not get any possession.
p256_102.txt|They are now divorced.
p256_103.txt|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p256_104.txt|Journalists should make him.
p256_105.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p256_106.txt|Get to know him.
p256_107.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p256_108.txt|We have every respect for Michelle.
p256_109.txt|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p256_110.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p256_111.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p256_112.txt|They will want to perform well.
p256_113.txt|It's not perfect.
p256_114.txt|It was the eighties.
p256_115.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p256_116.txt|This is a step backwards.
p256_117.txt|It was ugly.
p256_118.txt|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p256_119.txt|I joined a group.
p256_120.txt|It is rubbish.
p256_121.txt|Who would be a referee?
p256_122.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p256_123.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p256_124.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p256_125.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p256_126.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p256_127.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p256_128.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p256_129.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p256_130.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p256_131.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p256_132.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p256_133.txt|Who will attend?
p256_134.txt|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p256_135.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p256_136.txt|Our intentions are real.
p256_137.txt|It is also well received.
p256_138.txt|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p256_139.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p256_140.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p256_141.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p256_142.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p256_143.txt|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p256_144.txt|It changed my life.
p256_145.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p256_146.txt|It is not just about pay.
p256_147.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p256_148.txt|I was so nervous.
p256_149.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p256_150.txt|They have not been named.
p256_151.txt|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p256_152.txt|We should be clear about the role of government.
p256_153.txt|It was by the numbers.
p256_154.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p256_155.txt|We will turn the corner.
p256_156.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p256_157.txt|He can do no wrong.
p256_158.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p256_159.txt|These days are long gone.
p256_160.txt|I will tell you.
p256_161.txt|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p256_162.txt|It has to be now.
p256_163.txt|We have to move forward.
p256_164.txt|They are not advertised.
p256_165.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p256_166.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p256_167.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p256_168.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p256_169.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p256_170.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p256_171.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p256_172.txt|It is too much for me.
p256_173.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p256_174.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p256_175.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p256_176.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p256_177.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p256_178.txt|They took a risk.
p256_179.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p256_180.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p256_181.txt|Nothing is safe.
p256_182.txt|They will run a mile.
p256_183.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p256_184.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p256_185.txt|We did everything by the book.
p256_186.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p256_187.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p256_188.txt|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p256_189.txt|It is a terrible loss.
p256_190.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p256_191.txt|If the director is with you.
p256_192.txt|I am totally surprised.
p256_193.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p256_194.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p256_195.txt|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p256_196.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p256_197.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p256_198.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p256_199.txt|People acted too quickly.
p256_200.txt|I have a cold.
p256_201.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p256_202.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p256_203.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p256_204.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p256_205.txt|But she might be.
p256_206.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p256_207.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p256_208.txt|It's like a garage.
p256_209.txt|But I am a worried man.
p256_210.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p256_211.txt|She should not be blamed.
p256_212.txt|It had all been arranged.
p256_213.txt|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p256_214.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p256_215.txt|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p256_216.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p256_217.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p256_218.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p256_219.txt|We've got the bronze.
p256_220.txt|It's so special.
p256_221.txt|We will be victorious.
p256_222.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p256_223.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p256_224.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p256_225.txt|I am immensely sad.
p256_226.txt|It is a gamble.
p256_227.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p256_228.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p256_229.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p256_230.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p256_231.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p256_232.txt|The body follows the mind.
p256_233.txt|It is set in Paris.
p256_234.txt|It's quite nice.
p256_235.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p256_236.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p256_237.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p256_238.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p256_239.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p256_240.txt|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p256_241.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p256_242.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p256_243.txt|It is hard won.
p256_244.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p256_245.txt|The scene is about this?
p256_246.txt|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p256_247.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p256_248.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p256_249.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p256_250.txt|It was a hit.
p256_251.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p256_252.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p256_253.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p256_254.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p256_255.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p256_256.txt|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p256_257.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p256_258.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p256_259.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p256_260.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p256_261.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p256_262.txt|I am very angry.
p256_263.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p256_264.txt|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p256_265.txt|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p256_266.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p256_267.txt|That's the only thing I will say.
p256_268.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p256_269.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p256_270.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p256_271.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p256_272.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p256_273.txt|And Michael was just great.
p256_274.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p256_275.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p256_276.txt|I am an estate agent.
p256_277.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p256_278.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p256_279.txt|It happens from time to time.
p256_280.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p256_281.txt|But I've won both ways.
p256_282.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p256_283.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p256_284.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p256_285.txt|It's like a high school play.
p256_286.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p256_287.txt|It's very safe.
p256_288.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p256_289.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p256_290.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p256_291.txt|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p256_292.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p256_293.txt|The songs are just so good.
p256_294.txt|Who can predict?
p256_295.txt|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p256_296.txt|It became a book by itself.
p256_297.txt|The home was now under new management.
p256_298.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p256_300.txt|One was a lawyer.
p256_301.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p256_302.txt|The party lasted all night.
p256_303.txt|It's so awful.
p256_304.txt|It's just not funny!
p256_305.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p256_306.txt|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p256_307.txt|It is no surprise.
p256_308.txt|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p256_309.txt|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p256_310.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p256_311.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p256_312.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p256_313.txt|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p256_314.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p256_315.txt|They were fantastic.
p256_316.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p256_317.txt|She is very distinctive.
p256_318.txt|It's not even finished.
p256_319.txt|Henman has been warned.
p256_320.txt|It should be equal.
p257_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p257_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p257_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p257_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p257_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p257_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p257_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p257_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p257_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p257_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p257_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p257_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p257_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p257_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p257_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p257_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p257_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p257_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p257_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p257_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p257_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p257_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p257_025.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p257_026.txt|Is this accurate?
p257_027.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257_028.txt|Because we do not need it.
p257_029.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p257_030.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p257_031.txt|It was clear.
p257_032.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p257_033.txt|I came to complete.
p257_034.txt|President Bush is at war.
p257_035.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p257_036.txt|I was scared.
p257_037.txt|It was ugly.
p257_038.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p257_039.txt|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p257_040.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p257_041.txt|A neighbour said.
p257_042.txt|We need to chat.
p257_043.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p257_044.txt|I hate the word.
p257_045.txt|That should do it.
p257_046.txt|It's a blessing.
p257_047.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p257_048.txt|As she explains.
p257_049.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p257_050.txt|He had no enemies.
p257_051.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p257_052.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p257_053.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p257_054.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p257_055.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p257_056.txt|It's very odd.
p257_057.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p257_058.txt|It is not great art.
p257_059.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257_060.txt|There was a battle there.
p257_061.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p257_062.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p257_063.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p257_064.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257_065.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p257_066.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257_067.txt|It's all I can do.
p257_068.txt|There could be a way back.
p257_069.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p257_070.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p257_071.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257_072.txt|I had my suspicions.
p257_073.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p257_074.txt|It was chaotic.
p257_075.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p257_076.txt|I've not thought about it.
p257_077.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p257_078.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257_079.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p257_080.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p257_081.txt|It may well have been.
p257_082.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257_083.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257_084.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257_085.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p257_086.txt|It's never too late.
p257_087.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p257_088.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p257_089.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p257_090.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p257_091.txt|We must look forward.
p257_092.txt|It is an old family habit.
p257_093.txt|He was possessed
p257_094.txt|She told The Herald.
p257_095.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p257_096.txt|The peace process will be buried!
p257_097.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p257_098.txt|They are now divorced.
p257_099.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p257_100.txt|It was mayhem.
p257_101.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p257_102.txt|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p257_103.txt|We have every respect for Michelle.
p257_104.txt|That time is not now, however.
p257_105.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p257_106.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p257_107.txt|They will want to perform well.
p257_108.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p257_109.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p257_110.txt|It is normal.
p257_111.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p257_112.txt|I don't have many friends.
p257_113.txt|It's a shame.
p257_114.txt|It was the eighties.
p257_115.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p257_116.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p257_117.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p257_118.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p257_119.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p257_120.txt|Does this mean.
p257_121.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p257_122.txt|He did his job.
p257_123.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p257_124.txt|That's all right then.
p257_125.txt|I was furious.
p257_126.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p257_127.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p257_128.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p257_129.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p257_130.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p257_131.txt|Who will attend?
p257_132.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p257_133.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p257_134.txt|I am now unemployed.
p257_135.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p257_136.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p257_137.txt|Our intentions are real.
p257_138.txt|It is also well received.
p257_139.txt|What will happen then?
p257_140.txt|It's not true.
p257_141.txt|I feel very grateful with everything.
p257_142.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p257_143.txt|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p257_144.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p257_145.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p257_146.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p257_147.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p257_148.txt|It is like a football team.
p257_149.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p257_150.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p257_151.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p257_152.txt|They did very well.
p257_153.txt|It became a book by itself.
p257_154.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p257_155.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p257_156.txt|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p257_157.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p257_158.txt|There's a pause.
p257_159.txt|He can do no wrong.
p257_160.txt|It was so new, so exciting.
p257_161.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p257_162.txt|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p257_163.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p257_164.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257_165.txt|I lost my head.
p257_166.txt|You are not going in blind.
p257_167.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p257_168.txt|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p257_169.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p257_170.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p257_171.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p257_172.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p257_173.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p257_174.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p257_175.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p257_176.txt|It's quite a routine.
p257_177.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p257_178.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p257_179.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p257_180.txt|It is minute.
p257_181.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p257_182.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p257_183.txt|One was a lawyer.
p257_184.txt|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p257_185.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p257_186.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p257_187.txt|Saturday is gone.
p257_188.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p257_189.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p257_190.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p257_191.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p257_192.txt|Off I went.
p257_193.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p257_194.txt|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p257_195.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p257_196.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p257_197.txt|It's just awful.
p257_198.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p257_199.txt|IT S all in the hair.
p257_200.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p257_201.txt|But I am a worried man.
p257_202.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p257_203.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p257_204.txt|He knows a lot.
p257_205.txt|He is slightly confused.
p257_206.txt|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257_207.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p257_208.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p257_209.txt|It had all been arranged.
p257_210.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p257_211.txt|We have got to get it right.
p257_212.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p257_213.txt|I might come back.
p257_214.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p257_215.txt|It's just a place to open it.
p257_216.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p257_217.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p257_218.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p257_219.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p257_220.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p257_221.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p257_222.txt|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p257_223.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p257_224.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p257_225.txt|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p257_226.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p257_227.txt|They had no children.
p257_228.txt|It is set in Paris.
p257_229.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p257_230.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p257_231.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p257_232.txt|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257_233.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p257_234.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p257_235.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p257_236.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p257_237.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p257_238.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p257_239.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p257_240.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p257_241.txt|I should think so, too.
p257_242.txt|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p257_243.txt|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p257_244.txt|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p257_245.txt|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p257_246.txt|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p257_247.txt|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p257_248.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p257_249.txt|I watched a game.
p257_250.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p257_251.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p257_252.txt|they fail to engage.
p257_253.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p257_254.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p257_255.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p257_256.txt|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p257_257.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p257_258.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p257_259.txt|It's very nice.
p257_260.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p257_261.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p257_262.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p257_263.txt|And Michael was just great.
p257_264.txt|We're in shock.
p257_265.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p257_266.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p257_267.txt|One knows the feeling.
p257_268.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p257_269.txt|She looked so young.
p257_270.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p257_271.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p257_272.txt|He looked very sharp.
p257_273.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p257_274.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p257_275.txt|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257_276.txt|Well, he can do it.
p257_277.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p257_278.txt|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p257_279.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p257_280.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p257_281.txt|He should have won.
p257_282.txt|A new school will be built.
p257_283.txt|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p257_284.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p257_285.txt|What has altered?
p257_286.txt|The home was now under new management.
p257_287.txt|Graeme was prepared.
p257_288.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p257_289.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p257_290.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p257_291.txt|They are wrong.
p257_292.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p257_293.txt|It's just not funny!
p257_294.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p257_295.txt|The plot is minimal.
p257_296.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p257_297.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p257_298.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p257_299.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p257_300.txt|They were fantastic.
p257_301.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p257_302.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p257_303.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p257_304.txt|Kids are terrible.
p257_305.txt|Henman has been warned.
p257_306.txt|It should be equal.
p257_307.txt|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p257_308.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p257_309.txt|It is out there.
p257_310.txt|They had a confession.
p257_311.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p257_312.txt|We are in the end game.
p257_313.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p257_314.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p257_315.txt|I am so upset.
p257_316.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p257_317.txt|I saw some good things.
p257_318.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p257_319.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p257_320.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p257_321.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p257_322.txt|You feel the pride.
p257_323.txt|It is so unfair.
p257_324.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p257_325.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p257_326.txt|I've got no secret.
p257_327.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p257_328.txt|I'm very lucky.
p257_329.txt|We must do something.
p257_330.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p257_331.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p257_332.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p257_333.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p257_334.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p257_335.txt|It is long gone.
p257_336.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p257_337.txt|Tell us about it.
p257_338.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p257_339.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p257_340.txt|It was very formal.
p257_341.txt|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p257_342.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p257_343.txt|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p257_344.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p257_345.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p257_346.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p257_347.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257_348.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p257_349.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p257_350.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p257_351.txt|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p257_352.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p257_353.txt|There is no signature.
p257_354.txt|It's a long process.
p257_355.txt|It is a large number.
p257_356.txt|He knew his job inside out.
p257_357.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p257_358.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p257_359.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p257_360.txt|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
p257_361.txt|He has the edge.
p257_362.txt|He denied the charge.
p257_363.txt|There were no casualties.
p257_364.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p257_365.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p257_366.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p257_367.txt|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p257_368.txt|They really did a great job.
p257_369.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p257_370.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p257_371.txt|This year I understood.
p257_372.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p257_373.txt|It is unusual.
p257_374.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p257_375.txt|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p257_376.txt|I can lead by example.
p257_377.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p257_378.txt|They are good.
p257_379.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p257_380.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p257_381.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p257_382.txt|It was on fire.
p257_383.txt|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p257_384.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p257_385.txt|Emotions were complex.
p257_386.txt|He's already made history.
p257_387.txt|So I did.
p257_388.txt|You ask the question.
p257_389.txt|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p257_390.txt|There was no trouble.
p257_391.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p257_392.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p257_393.txt|It is not a standing army.
p257_394.txt|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p257_395.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p257_396.txt|You wanted the evidence.
p257_397.txt|Our numbers are small.
p257_398.txt|I was very young.
p257_399.txt|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257_400.txt|I am the Son of Sam.
p257_401.txt|She is superb.
p257_402.txt|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257_403.txt|It doesn't always work that way.
p257_404.txt|It is simple, but profound.
p257_405.txt|No preference emerged.
p257_406.txt|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p257_407.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p257_408.txt|She has reached the top of her profession.
p257_409.txt|It goes with the job.
p257_410.txt|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p257_411.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p257_412.txt|I recommend a tour.
p257_413.txt|We are delighted with this outcome.
p257_414.txt|I have so much respect for him.
p257_415.txt|We shall be victorious.
p257_416.txt|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p257_417.txt|War is not the action.
p257_418.txt|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p257_419.txt|It's not about defining styles.
p257_420.txt|One must hope not!
p257_421.txt|It is marvellous.
p257_422.txt|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p257_423.txt|They should not be blamed for it.
p257_424.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p257_425.txt|It is bizarre.
p257_426.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p257_427.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p257_428.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p257_429.txt|It's a miracle.
p257_430.txt|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p257_431.txt|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p257_432.txt|They will form a tribute.
p257_433.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p257_434.txt|The bill would be massive.
p258_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p258_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p258_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p258_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p258_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p258_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p258_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p258_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p258_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p258_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p258_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p258_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p258_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p258_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p258_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p258_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p258_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p258_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p258_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p258_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p258_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p258_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p258_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p258_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p258_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p258_026.txt|It's nice to hear.
p258_027.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p258_028.txt|They should be so lucky.
p258_029.txt|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p258_030.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p258_031.txt|Because we do not need it.
p258_032.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p258_033.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p258_034.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p258_035.txt|It was clear.
p258_036.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p258_037.txt|President Bush is at war.
p258_038.txt|I was scared.
p258_039.txt|It will come all right.
p258_040.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p258_041.txt|The judge said.
p258_042.txt|We need to chat.
p258_043.txt|It's a blessing.
p258_044.txt|As she explains.
p258_045.txt|She looked so young.
p258_046.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p258_047.txt|It is the whole package.
p258_048.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p258_049.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p258_050.txt|That's the day job.
p258_051.txt|We have not given up hope.
p258_052.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p258_053.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p258_054.txt|It's that kind of place.
p258_055.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p258_056.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_057.txt|He was popular.
p258_058.txt|It should be devolved.
p258_059.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p258_060.txt|Try to save us.
p258_061.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p258_062.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258_063.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p258_064.txt|That was the easy election.
p258_065.txt|It's all I can do.
p258_066.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p258_067.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p258_068.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p258_069.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p258_070.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p258_071.txt|He got the same story.
p258_072.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p258_073.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p258_074.txt|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p258_075.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p258_076.txt|I first met him last summer.
p258_077.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p258_078.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p258_079.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p258_080.txt|We have other options.
p258_081.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p258_082.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p258_083.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p258_084.txt|They are different types.
p258_085.txt|It is a simple equation.
p258_086.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p258_087.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p258_088.txt|There was no rescue.
p258_089.txt|She's got to say something.
p258_090.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p258_091.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p258_092.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p258_093.txt|Journalists should make him.
p258_094.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p258_095.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p258_096.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p258_097.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p258_098.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p258_099.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p258_100.txt|It's not perfect.
p258_101.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p258_102.txt|She has been shot.
p258_103.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p258_104.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p258_105.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p258_106.txt|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p258_107.txt|It is so sad.
p258_108.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p258_109.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p258_110.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p258_111.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p258_112.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p258_113.txt|I joined a group.
p258_114.txt|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p258_115.txt|Who would have?
p258_116.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p258_117.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p258_118.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p258_119.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p258_120.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p258_121.txt|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p258_122.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p258_123.txt|She does not want to speak.
p258_124.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p258_125.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p258_126.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p258_127.txt|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p258_128.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p258_129.txt|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p258_130.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p258_131.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p258_132.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p258_133.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p258_134.txt|My conscience is not clear.
p258_135.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p258_136.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p258_137.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p258_138.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p258_139.txt|Is that Titanic?
p258_140.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p258_141.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p258_142.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.

p258_160.txt|We try to keep it right.
p258_161.txt|It's that sort of night.
p258_162.txt|I lost my head.
p258_163.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p258_164.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p258_165.txt|That will do for me.
p258_166.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p258_167.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p258_168.txt|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p258_169.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p258_170.txt|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p258_171.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p258_172.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p258_173.txt|It should be easy.
p258_174.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p258_175.txt|I drove the ball well.
p258_176.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.

p258_178.txt|They will run a mile.
p258_179.txt|Four policemen were wounded.

p258_183.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p258_184.txt|We want to help them through it.
p258_185.txt|It is a terrible loss.
p258_186.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p258_187.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p258_188.txt|If the director is with you.
p258_189.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p258_190.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p258_191.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p258_192.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p258_193.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p258_194.txt|It's the same old story.
p258_195.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p258_196.txt|Is that success?
p258_197.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p258_198.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p258_199.txt|But she might be.
p258_200.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p258_201.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p258_202.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p258_203.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p258_204.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p258_205.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p258_206.txt|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p258_207.txt|Feel the heat?
p258_208.txt|He is slightly confused.
p258_209.txt|She should not be blamed.
p258_210.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p258_211.txt|It had all been arranged.
p258_212.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p258_213.txt|His third goal was superb.
p258_214.txt|It's not ideal.
p258_215.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p258_216.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p258_217.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p258_218.txt|I might come back.
p258_219.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p258_220.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.

p258_224.txt|It's so special.
p258_225.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p258_226.txt|What was the main difference?
p258_227.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p258_228.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p258_229.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p258_230.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p258_231.txt|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p258_232.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p258_233.txt|They had no children.
p258_234.txt|We are in the hat.
p258_235.txt|They should come forward.
p258_236.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p258_237.txt|It's quite nice.
p258_238.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p258_239.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.

p258_245.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p258_246.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p258_247.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p258_248.txt|I was shocked.
p258_249.txt|I should think so, too.
p258_250.txt|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p258_251.txt|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p258_252.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.

p258_254.txt|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p258_255.txt|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p258_256.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p258_257.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p258_258.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p258_259.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p258_260.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p258_261.txt|I am very angry.
p258_262.txt|They must play for each other.
p258_263.txt|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p258_264.txt|It is also very valuable.
p258_265.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p258_266.txt|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.

p258_271.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p258_272.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.

p258_274.txt|It is the same in Sweden.
p258_275.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p258_276.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p258_277.txt|They were all in a stable condition last night.
p258_278.txt|It's a way of life.
p258_279.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p258_280.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p258_281.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p258_282.txt|It's so awful.
p258_283.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p258_284.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p258_285.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p258_286.txt|This is a national crisis.
p258_287.txt|The death toll included five children.
p258_288.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p258_289.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p258_290.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p258_291.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p258_292.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p258_293.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p258_294.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p258_295.txt|A new school will be built.
p258_296.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p258_297.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p258_298.txt|The home was now under new management.

p258_300.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p258_301.txt|Nothing is safe.
p258_302.txt|One was a lawyer.
p258_303.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p258_304.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p258_305.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p258_306.txt|This is a war over our home.
p258_307.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p258_308.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p258_309.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p258_310.txt|It's certainly different.
p258_311.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p258_312.txt|He will go a long way.
p258_313.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p258_314.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p258_315.txt|They were fantastic.
p258_316.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p258_317.txt|Kids are terrible.
p258_318.txt|It should be equal.
p258_319.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p258_320.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p258_321.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p258_322.txt|He said she was mad.
p258_323.txt|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p258_324.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p258_325.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p258_326.txt|There was some merit in that.
p258_327.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p258_328.txt|It is a strong case.
p258_329.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p258_330.txt|Off with their heads.
p258_331.txt|I am so upset.
p258_332.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p258_333.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p258_334.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p258_335.txt|There was no option.
p258_336.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p258_337.txt|He did a good job.
p258_338.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p258_339.txt|It was so new, so exciting.
p258_340.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p258_341.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p258_342.txt|I've got no secret.
p258_343.txt|There's no place to hide.
p258_344.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p258_345.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p258_346.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p258_347.txt|The composer will conduct.
p258_348.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p258_349.txt|I got a yellow card.
p258_350.txt|It is long gone.
p258_351.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p258_352.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p258_353.txt|I saw some good things.
p258_354.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p258_355.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p258_356.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p258_357.txt|It was very formal.
p258_358.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p258_359.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p258_360.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p258_361.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p258_362.txt|We will be homeless.
p258_363.txt|That would help.
p258_364.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p258_365.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p258_366.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p258_367.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p258_368.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p258_369.txt|I feel pretty good.
p258_370.txt|I am a star.
p258_371.txt|He could make it.
p258_372.txt|I thought he was my friend.
p258_373.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p258_374.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p258_375.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p258_376.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p258_377.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p258_378.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p258_379.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p258_380.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p258_381.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p258_382.txt|It was a cry for help.
p258_383.txt|Something is wrong.
p258_384.txt|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p258_385.txt|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p258_386.txt|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p258_387.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p258_388.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p258_389.txt|I was so nervous.
p258_390.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p258_391.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p258_392.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p258_393.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p258_394.txt|This year I understood.
p258_395.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p258_396.txt|I suspect the latter.
p258_397.txt|These guys are looking for business.
p258_398.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p258_399.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p258_400.txt|The car was just there.
p258_401.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p258_402.txt|It is full-scale.
p258_403.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p258_404.txt|Then , he laughs.
p258_405.txt|They are not left wing.
p258_406.txt|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p258_407.txt|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p258_408.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p258_409.txt|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p258_410.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p258_411.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p258_412.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p258_413.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p258_414.txt|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p260_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p260_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p260_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p260_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p260_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p260_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p260_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p260_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p260_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p260_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p260_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p260_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p260_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p260_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p260_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p260_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p260_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p260_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p260_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p260_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p260_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p260_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p260_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p260_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p260_025.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p260_026.txt|We will be homeless.
p260_027.txt|Is this accurate?
p260_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p260_029.txt|They have no history.
p260_030.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p260_031.txt|I'd just like to play.
p260_032.txt|There's a story, too.
p260_033.txt|This is the window.
p260_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p260_035.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p260_036.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p260_037.txt|It's a fact.
p260_038.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260_039.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260_040.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p260_041.txt|Dancing was her life.
p260_042.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260_043.txt|We will push.
p260_044.txt|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p260_046.txt|It is marvellous.
p260_047.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p260_048.txt|Our people are ready.
p260_049.txt|Here's a clue.
p260_050.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260_051.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p260_052.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p260_053.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p260_054.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p260_055.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260_056.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p260_057.txt|What was the main difference?
p260_058.txt|There's a danger.
p260_059.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260_060.txt|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260_061.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260_062.txt|It's that kind of place.
p260_063.txt|They are real.
p260_064.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260_065.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p260_066.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p260_067.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p260_068.txt|We should have known.
p260_069.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p260_070.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p260_071.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p260_072.txt|It was magic.
p260_073.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p260_074.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p260_075.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p260_076.txt|The party is up for it.
p260_077.txt|Even the one she loved.
p260_078.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p260_079.txt|Today she has been released.
p260_080.txt|Who will pay for this?
p260_081.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p260_082.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p260_083.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p260_084.txt|They lived for their children.
p260_085.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p260_086.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p260_087.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p260_088.txt|It is a lifeline.
p260_089.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p260_090.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p260_091.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p260_092.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p260_093.txt|Then came the crunch.
p260_094.txt|It is annoying.
p260_095.txt|I love the Dome.
p260_096.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p260_097.txt|I am extremely sad.
p260_098.txt|It is a love affair.
p260_099.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p260_100.txt|May not have been at fault?
p260_101.txt|They tried to deny it.
p260_102.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p260_103.txt|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p260_104.txt|That's all right then.
p260_105.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p260_106.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p260_107.txt|She reflects a bit.
p260_108.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p260_109.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p260_110.txt|It was a funny game.
p260_111.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p260_112.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p260_113.txt|It was the eighties.
p260_114.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p260_115.txt|It is so sad.
p260_116.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p260_117.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p260_118.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p260_119.txt|It is rubbish.
p260_120.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p260_121.txt|We enjoyed it today.
p260_122.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p260_123.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p260_124.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p260_125.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p260_126.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p260_127.txt|The people will come.
p260_128.txt|No production was achieved.
p260_129.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p260_130.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p260_131.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p260_132.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p260_133.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p260_134.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p260_135.txt|I don't know the full story.
p260_136.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p260_137.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p260_138.txt|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p260_139.txt|I was awful.
p260_140.txt|The idea is simple.
p260_141.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p260_142.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p260_143.txt|It is not just about pay.
p260_144.txt|Note the date.
p260_145.txt|So I got a blood test.
p260_146.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p260_147.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p260_148.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p260_149.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p260_150.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p260_151.txt|I was on a roll.
p260_152.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p260_153.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p260_154.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p260_155.txt|He was asked to quit.
p260_156.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p260_157.txt|He can do no wrong.
p260_158.txt|Was this element always there?
p260_159.txt|These days are long gone.
p260_160.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p260_161.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p260_162.txt|They are not advertised.
p260_163.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p260_164.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p260_165.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p260_166.txt|They will do their own thing.
p260_167.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p260_168.txt|One season, they might do well.
p260_169.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p260_170.txt|As we worked.
p260_171.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p260_172.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p260_173.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p260_174.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p260_175.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p260_176.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p260_177.txt|I've been there.
p260_178.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p260_179.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p260_180.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p260_181.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p260_182.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p260_183.txt|Our team is just so young.
p260_184.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p260_185.txt|It is a farce.
p260_186.txt|Peace was won.
p260_187.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p260_188.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p260_189.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p260_190.txt|Is that success?
p260_191.txt|They are ready.
p260_192.txt|I have a cold.
p260_193.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p260_194.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p260_195.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p260_196.txt|There was no safety net.
p260_197.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p260_198.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p260_199.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p260_200.txt|There was an e-mail.
p260_201.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p260_202.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p260_203.txt|It had all been arranged.
p260_204.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p260_205.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p260_206.txt|It's not ideal.
p260_207.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p260_208.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p260_209.txt|I might come back.
p260_210.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p260_211.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p260_212.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p260_213.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p260_214.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p260_215.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p260_216.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p260_217.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p260_218.txt|It's not before time.
p260_219.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p260_220.txt|The report is due out next month.
p260_221.txt|But she was.
p260_222.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p260_223.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p260_224.txt|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p260_225.txt|We were awful.
p260_226.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p260_227.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p260_228.txt|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p260_229.txt|There is no excuse.
p260_230.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p260_231.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p260_232.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p260_233.txt|The car was just there.
p260_234.txt|The whole thing will be great.
p260_235.txt|Our policy is clear.
p260_236.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p260_237.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p260_238.txt|The scene is about this?
p260_239.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p260_240.txt|It was a kind of contempt.
p260_241.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p260_242.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p260_243.txt|I should think so, too.
p260_244.txt|It was a hit.
p260_245.txt|There's the mix.
p260_246.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p260_247.txt|Is there on his hands?
p260_248.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p260_249.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p260_250.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p260_251.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p260_252.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p260_253.txt|We have to expand.
p260_254.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p260_255.txt|Is that a serious question?
p260_256.txt|They must play for each other.
p260_257.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p260_258.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p260_259.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p260_260.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p260_261.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p260_262.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p260_263.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p260_264.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p260_265.txt|The system can work.
p260_266.txt|We're in shock.
p260_267.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p260_268.txt|It's a way of life.
p260_269.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p260_270.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p260_271.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p260_272.txt|She looked so young.
p260_273.txt|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p260_274.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p260_275.txt|If not, he should go home.
p260_276.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p260_277.txt|We are a grandmother.
p260_278.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p260_279.txt|You feel very helpless.
p260_280.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p260_281.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p260_282.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p260_283.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p260_284.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p260_285.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p260_286.txt|This is a national crisis.
p260_287.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p260_288.txt|We are not going to forget.
p260_289.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p260_290.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p260_291.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p260_292.txt|The songs are just so good.
p260_293.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p260_294.txt|The goals will come.
p260_295.txt|Who can predict?
p260_296.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p260_297.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p260_298.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p260_299.txt|I was the sheep.
p260_300.txt|What has altered?
p260_301.txt|Nothing is safe.
p260_302.txt|One was a lawyer.
p260_303.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p260_304.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p260_305.txt|They are wrong.
p260_306.txt|I can live with it.
p260_307.txt|Work has started.
p260_308.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p260_309.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p260_310.txt|You should be.
p260_311.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p260_312.txt|The letters are going out today.
p260_313.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p260_314.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p260_315.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p260_316.txt|Special measures were needed.
p260_317.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p260_318.txt|The show is at an end.
p260_319.txt|Your father was a good man.
p260_320.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p260_321.txt|We have got to get the points from this one.
p260_322.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p260_323.txt|Henman has been warned.
p260_324.txt|I would love it.
p260_326.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p260_327.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p260_328.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p260_329.txt|We are in the end game.
p260_330.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p260_331.txt|There was no time scale.
p260_332.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p260_333.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p260_334.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p260_335.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p260_336.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p260_337.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p260_338.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p260_339.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p260_340.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p260_341.txt|He was the architect.
p260_342.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p260_343.txt|He has to learn.
p260_344.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p260_345.txt|I've got no secret.
p260_346.txt|This is a big advantage.
p260_347.txt|I'm very lucky.
p260_348.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p260_349.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p260_350.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p260_351.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p260_352.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p260_353.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p260_354.txt|I HAVE a dream.
p260_355.txt|We have big ideas.
p260_356.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p260_357.txt|I first met him last summer.
p261_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p261_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p261_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p261_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p261_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p261_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p261_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p261_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p261_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p261_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p261_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p261_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p261_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p261_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p261_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p261_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p261_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p261_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p261_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p261_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p261_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p261_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p261_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p261_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p261_025.txt|They are very clever in their use of words.
p261_026.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p261_027.txt|Because we do not need it.
p261_028.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p261_029.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p261_030.txt|We will look into it.
p261_031.txt|I have never been a member of the council.
p261_032.txt|It was a close call.
p261_033.txt|That means an extra two years.
p261_034.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p261_035.txt|That was the case with David.
p261_036.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p261_037.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p261_038.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p261_039.txt|Their campaign is in disarray.
p261_040.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p261_041.txt|I was released after six days.
p261_042.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p261_043.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p261_044.txt|I would love to have him home.
p261_045.txt|He will need that machine.
p261_046.txt|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p261_047.txt|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p261_048.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p261_049.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p261_050.txt|There was no safety net.
p261_051.txt|I must take a seat.
p261_052.txt|It is on the news.
p261_053.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p261_054.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p261_055.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p261_056.txt|We will pay their bills.
p261_057.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p261_058.txt|How are you, sir ?
p261_059.txt|So is that it, then ?
p261_060.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p261_061.txt|What do we do ?
p261_062.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p261_063.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p261_064.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p261_065.txt|It's not covered by the insurance.
p261_066.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p261_067.txt|That's not the intention at all.
p261_068.txt|It starts with the script.
p261_069.txt|There could be a way back.
p261_070.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p261_071.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p261_072.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p261_073.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p261_074.txt|He is now resident in England.
p261_075.txt|These people are not big names.
p261_076.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p261_077.txt|He is in the queue.
p261_078.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p261_079.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p261_080.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p261_081.txt|Our mother is very worried.
p261_082.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p261_083.txt|They lived for their children.
p261_084.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p261_085.txt|They deserve a lot of credit.
p261_086.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p261_087.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p261_088.txt|It is high time to act.
p261_089.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p261_090.txt|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
p261_091.txt|We could not get any possession.
p261_092.txt|It was clear on Thursday.
p261_093.txt|But it is up again.
p261_094.txt|All the pressure will be on him.
p261_095.txt|You are like an animal.
p261_096.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p261_097.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p261_098.txt|I had a ball today.
p261_099.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p261_100.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p261_101.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p261_102.txt|We are also looking for new licences.
p261_103.txt|Our house was very small.
p261_104.txt|It was a funny game.
p261_105.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p261_106.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p261_107.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p261_108.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p261_109.txt|And does it ?
p261_110.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p261_111.txt|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p261_112.txt|It became a national network.
p261_113.txt|He thought she was amazing.
p261_114.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p261_115.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p261_116.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p261_117.txt|It's not a quick fix.
p261_118.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p261_119.txt|Structural changes were also required.
p261_120.txt|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p261_121.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p261_122.txt|I was on a roll.
p261_123.txt|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p261_124.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p261_125.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p261_126.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p261_127.txt|He can perform well under pressure.
p261_128.txt|I have accepted the challenge.
p261_129.txt|You are a gambling man.
p261_130.txt|He is a great addition to our team.
p261_131.txt|This is a successful outcome.
p261_132.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p261_133.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p261_134.txt|We will try to find someone.
p261_135.txt|The others have all been in storage for some time.
p261_136.txt|She died at her home.
p261_137.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p261_138.txt|Check that he is dead.
p261_139.txt|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
p261_140.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p261_141.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p261_142.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p261_143.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p261_144.txt|I would relish the prospect.
p261_145.txt|It has become a way of life.
p261_146.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p261_147.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p261_148.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p261_149.txt|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p261_150.txt|It was by the numbers.
p261_151.txt|But I am still awaiting an answer.
p261_152.txt|We will turn the corner.
p261_153.txt|He was asked to quit.
p261_154.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p261_155.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p261_156.txt|These days are long gone.
p261_157.txt|The bank was now involved.
p261_158.txt|We have to move forward.
p261_159.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p261_160.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p261_161.txt|The pension levels will remain the same.
p261_162.txt|I would probably have to agree with him.
p261_163.txt|You had to go and see him.
p261_164.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p261_165.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p261_166.txt|The region is open for business.
p261_167.txt|They could not match it.
p261_168.txt|What happened in that game ?
p261_169.txt|Are you going to win ?
p261_170.txt|Was it the wife ?
p261_171.txt|Why change it ?
p261_172.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p261_173.txt|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p261_174.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p261_175.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p261_176.txt|It is a body blow.
p261_177.txt|The jury is still out.
p261_178.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p261_179.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p261_180.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p261_181.txt|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p261_182.txt|I will be in Scotland.
p261_183.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p261_184.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p261_185.txt|I had too much to drink.
p261_186.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p261_187.txt|He prefers to play for them.
p261_188.txt|That is a waste of energy.
p261_189.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p261_190.txt|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p261_191.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p261_192.txt|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p261_193.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p261_194.txt|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p261_195.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p261_196.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p261_197.txt|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p261_198.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p261_199.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p261_200.txt|I made a terrible start.
p261_201.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p261_202.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p261_203.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p261_204.txt|It was his own decision.
p261_205.txt|Does the name matter ?
p261_206.txt|how do you get it back ?
p261_207.txt|What are you not good at ?
p261_208.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p261_209.txt|Who was she ?
p261_210.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p261_211.txt|I chose to go by the rules.
p261_212.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p261_213.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p261_214.txt|They are looking at a flotation.
p261_215.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p261_216.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p261_217.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p261_218.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p261_219.txt|They have known the hard times.
p261_220.txt|It has been like that all year for me.
p261_221.txt|Construction is due to begin in February.
p261_222.txt|Seven people were critically injured.
p261_223.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p261_224.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p261_225.txt|He must get to know himself.
p261_226.txt|It was a day for records.
p261_227.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p261_228.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p261_229.txt|Life is too short to be bitter.
p261_230.txt|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p261_231.txt|It could be to do with the location.
p261_232.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p261_233.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p261_234.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p261_235.txt|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p261_236.txt|They have not been in touch with the club.
p261_237.txt|I need a publishing deal!
p261_238.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p261_239.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p261_240.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p261_241.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p261_242.txt|This is a family club.
p261_243.txt|It is the loss of my name.
p261_244.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p261_245.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p261_246.txt|The irony was not lost.
p261_247.txt|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261_248.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p261_249.txt|I was just a kid.
p261_250.txt|It is now the big brother.
p261_251.txt|They showed a lot of heart.
p261_252.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p261_253.txt|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p261_254.txt|It was a poor performance.
p261_255.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p261_256.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p261_257.txt|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p261_258.txt|We will listen to any suggestion.
p261_259.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p261_260.txt|I should think so, too.
p261_261.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p261_262.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p261_263.txt|It seems a shame to leave it.
p261_264.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p261_265.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p261_266.txt|The concerns are the same.
p261_267.txt|I can't get a job.
p261_268.txt|And they were being paid ?
p261_269.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p261_270.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p261_271.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p261_272.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p261_273.txt|Did he trip ?
p261_274.txt|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p261_275.txt|I was ready for this.
p261_276.txt|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p261_277.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p261_278.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p261_279.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p261_280.txt|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p261_281.txt|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
p261_282.txt|At first I thought I was gone.
p261_283.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p261_284.txt|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p261_285.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p261_286.txt|They can leave at any time.
p261_287.txt|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p261_288.txt|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261_289.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p261_290.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p261_291.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p261_292.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p261_293.txt|He was also married with two children.
p261_294.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p261_295.txt|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p261_296.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p261_297.txt|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p261_298.txt|A senior party insider said.
p261_299.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p261_300.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p261_301.txt|This will help our confidence.
p261_302.txt|The two companies were not for sale.
p261_303.txt|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p261_304.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p261_305.txt|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p261_306.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p261_307.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p261_308.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p261_309.txt|We will deliver at director level.
p261_310.txt|Size is not the issue.
p261_311.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p261_312.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261_313.txt|Tony Blair said as little.
p261_314.txt|His was a huge success story.
p261_315.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p261_316.txt|That is the general feeling.
p261_317.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p261_318.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p261_319.txt|The casting is as perfect.
p261_320.txt|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p261_321.txt|A Home Office spokesman said.
p261_322.txt|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p261_323.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p261_324.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p261_325.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p261_326.txt|It is a potential danger.
p261_327.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p261_328.txt|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p261_329.txt|The City welcomed the numbers.
p261_330.txt|You will never get a conviction.
p261_331.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p261_332.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p261_333.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p261_334.txt|There will be good prospects ahead.
p261_335.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p261_336.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p261_337.txt|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p261_338.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p261_339.txt|What form did that take ?
p261_340.txt|Are they free ?
p261_341.txt|What are they for ?
p261_342.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p261_343.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p261_344.txt|So what happens next ?
p261_345.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p261_346.txt|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p261_347.txt|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p261_348.txt|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p261_349.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p261_350.txt|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p261_351.txt|The whole family was in shock.
p261_352.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p261_353.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p261_354.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p261_355.txt|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p261_356.txt|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p261_357.txt|Her life is now back on track.
p261_358.txt|There was some merit in that.
p261_359.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p261_360.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p261_361.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p261_362.txt|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p261_363.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p261_364.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p261_365.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p261_366.txt|He is not very big, either.
p261_367.txt|Finally came the moment of truth.
p261_368.txt|Neither man has been charged.
p261_369.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p261_370.txt|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261_371.txt|He did a good job.
p261_372.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p261_373.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p261_374.txt|Is it worth it ?
p261_375.txt|Does it matter ?
p261_376.txt|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p261_377.txt|I am a lucky man.
p261_378.txt|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261_379.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p261_380.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p261_381.txt|You did not see it.
p261_382.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p261_383.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p261_384.txt|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261_385.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p261_386.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p261_387.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p261_388.txt|He must have seen the movie.
p261_389.txt|We must put a marker down.
p261_390.txt|The result is called a patent.
p261_391.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p261_392.txt|This remains the party's policy.
p261_393.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p261_394.txt|I am a good player.
p261_395.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p261_396.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p261_397.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p261_398.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p261_399.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p261_400.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p261_401.txt|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p261_402.txt|We operate as a Scottish company.
p261_403.txt|How do you take them away ?
p261_404.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p261_405.txt|After the match, do you ?
p261_406.txt|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p261_407.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p261_408.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p261_409.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p261_410.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p261_411.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p261_412.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p261_413.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p261_414.txt|It is good for Europe.
p261_415.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p261_416.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p261_417.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p261_418.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p261_419.txt|But a surprise is in store.
p261_420.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p261_421.txt|The second goal was superb.
p261_422.txt|We're delighted about the vote.
p261_423.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p261_424.txt|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p261_425.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p261_426.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p261_427.txt|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p261_428.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p261_429.txt|He was on a horse.
p261_430.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p261_431.txt|That's the way it works.
p261_432.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p261_433.txt|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p261_434.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p261_435.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p261_436.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p261_437.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p261_438.txt|The trial will open today.
p261_439.txt|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p261_440.txt|It will make a huge difference.
p261_441.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p261_442.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p261_443.txt|It is a case of pity for us.
p261_444.txt|Gordon is also highly rated.
p261_445.txt|The first game is so important.
p261_446.txt|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p261_447.txt|And we might go back.
p261_448.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p261_449.txt|He deserves a second chance.
p261_450.txt|You have to see the work.
p261_451.txt|The funding is now there.
p261_452.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p261_453.txt|I was embarrassed by it.
p261_454.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p261_455.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p261_456.txt|Paris is not only young.
p261_457.txt|No one wants to go through these things.
p261_458.txt|Our legal advice is clear.
p261_459.txt|It all began as an accident.
p261_460.txt|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p261_461.txt|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261_462.txt|They were totally behind it.
p261_463.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p261_464.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p261_465.txt|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p261_466.txt|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p261_467.txt|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p261_468.txt|No options are excluded at all.
p261_469.txt|They are defined by law.
p261_470.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p261_471.txt|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261_472.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p261_473.txt|War is not the action.
p261_474.txt|My place is in the kitchen.
p262_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p262_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p262_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p262_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p262_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p262_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p262_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p262_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p262_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p262_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p262_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p262_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p262_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p262_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p262_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p262_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p262_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p262_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p262_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p262_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p262_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p262_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p262_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p262_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p262_025.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p262_026.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p262_027.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p262_028.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p262_029.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p262_030.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p262_031.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p262_032.txt|This is the window.
p262_033.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p262_034.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p262_035.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p262_036.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p262_037.txt|It was clear.
p262_038.txt|The problem is the pitch.
p262_039.txt|It was ugly.
p262_040.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p262_041.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p262_042.txt|The judge said.
p262_043.txt|It's a crucial award.
p262_044.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p262_045.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p262_046.txt|I was angry.
p262_047.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p262_048.txt|They had to explain it.
p262_049.txt|He had no enemies.
p262_050.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p262_051.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p262_052.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p262_053.txt|It's very odd.
p262_054.txt|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p262_055.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p262_056.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p262_057.txt|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p262_058.txt|Jobs could go.
p262_059.txt|And a film maker was born.
p262_060.txt|I fell against him.
p262_061.txt|There was a battle there.
p262_062.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p262_063.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p262_064.txt|He was popular.
p262_065.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p262_066.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p262_067.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p262_068.txt|It's all I can do.
p262_069.txt|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p262_070.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p262_071.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p262_072.txt|I had my suspicions.
p262_073.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p262_074.txt|I've not thought about it.
p262_075.txt|What has changed?
p262_076.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p262_077.txt|Detection is often difficult.
p262_078.txt|He is driven.
p262_079.txt|All options are open.
p262_080.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p262_081.txt|Someone who cares
p262_082.txt|It's never too late.
p262_083.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p262_084.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p262_085.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p262_086.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p262_087.txt|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p262_088.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p262_089.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p262_090.txt|Then came the crunch.
p262_091.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p262_092.txt|They are now divorced.
p262_093.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p262_094.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p262_095.txt|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p262_096.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p262_097.txt|It is a good day for the coalition.
p262_098.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p262_099.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p262_100.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p262_101.txt|It is a good lifestyle.
p262_102.txt|It was an adventure.
p262_103.txt|It's not perfect.
p262_104.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p262_105.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p262_106.txt|They are ready.
p262_107.txt|It's a shame.
p262_108.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p262_109.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p262_110.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p262_111.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p262_112.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p262_113.txt|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p262_114.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p262_115.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p262_116.txt|Who would have?
p262_117.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p262_118.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p262_119.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p262_120.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p262_121.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p262_122.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p262_123.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p262_124.txt|Our intentions are real.
p262_125.txt|The goals were good.
p262_126.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p262_127.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p262_128.txt|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p262_129.txt|It's a question of fashion.
p262_130.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p262_131.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p262_132.txt|We need to chat.
p262_133.txt|She died at her home.
p262_134.txt|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p262_135.txt|It would be a last resort.
p262_136.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p262_137.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p262_138.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p262_139.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p262_140.txt|It is huge.
p262_141.txt|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p262_142.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p262_143.txt|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p262_144.txt|Mr Blair had done well.
p262_145.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p262_146.txt|We should be clear about the role of government.
p262_147.txt|It is a freedom.
p262_148.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p262_149.txt|I knew he was good.
p262_150.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p262_151.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p262_152.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p262_153.txt|He can do no wrong.
p262_154.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p262_155.txt|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p262_156.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p262_157.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p262_158.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p262_159.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p262_160.txt|They are not advertised.
p262_161.txt|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p262_162.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p262_163.txt|It's that sort of night.
p262_164.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p262_165.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p262_166.txt|We have a budget in March.
p262_167.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p262_168.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p262_169.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p262_170.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p262_171.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p262_172.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p262_173.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p262_174.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p262_175.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p262_176.txt|The clarity is vital.
p262_177.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p262_178.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p262_179.txt|That has been the easy part.
p262_180.txt|He will need that machine.
p262_181.txt|Nothing is safe.
p262_182.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p262_183.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p262_184.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p262_185.txt|I had a train to catch.
p262_186.txt|That would be my view.
p262_187.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p262_188.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p262_189.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p262_190.txt|It wasn't to be.
p262_191.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p262_192.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p262_193.txt|Our strategy is straightforward.
p262_194.txt|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p262_195.txt|People acted too quickly.
p262_196.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p262_197.txt|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p262_198.txt|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p262_199.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p262_200.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p262_201.txt|They are in the euro.
p262_202.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p262_203.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p262_204.txt|There was no rescue.
p262_205.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p262_206.txt|But I am a worried man.
p262_207.txt|There was an e-mail.
p262_208.txt|It's a big deal for me.
p262_209.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p262_210.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p262_211.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p262_212.txt|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p262_213.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p262_214.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p262_215.txt|Work has started.
p262_216.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p262_217.txt|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p262_218.txt|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p262_219.txt|We have not given up hope.
p262_220.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p262_221.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p262_222.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p262_223.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p262_224.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p262_225.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p262_226.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p262_227.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p262_228.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p262_229.txt|It's that kind of place.
p262_230.txt|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p262_231.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p262_232.txt|It's very safe.
p262_233.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p262_234.txt|It is a terrible loss.
p262_235.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p262_236.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p262_237.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p262_238.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p262_239.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p262_240.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p262_241.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p262_242.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p262_243.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p262_244.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p262_245.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p262_246.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p262_247.txt|The scene is about this?
p262_248.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p262_249.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p262_250.txt|I was shocked.
p262_251.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p262_252.txt|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p262_253.txt|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p262_254.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p262_255.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p262_256.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p262_257.txt|We run within the law.
p262_258.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p262_259.txt|This is a big club.
p262_260.txt|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p262_261.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p262_262.txt|I am very angry.
p262_263.txt|I saw one body.
p262_264.txt|At first I thought I was gone.
p262_265.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p262_266.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p262_267.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p262_268.txt|It's very nice.
p262_269.txt|He was also married with two children.
p262_270.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p262_271.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p262_272.txt|It's not even finished.
p262_273.txt|Things can change.
p262_274.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p262_275.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p262_276.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p262_277.txt|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p262_278.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p262_279.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p262_280.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p262_281.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p262_282.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p262_283.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p262_284.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p262_285.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p262_286.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p262_287.txt|It was a virus.
p262_288.txt|The mood is good.
p262_289.txt|This is a national crisis.
p262_290.txt|The death toll included five children.
p262_291.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p262_292.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p262_293.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p262_294.txt|Well, he can do it.
p262_295.txt|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p262_296.txt|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p262_297.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p262_298.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p262_299.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p262_300.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p262_301.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p262_302.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p262_303.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p262_304.txt|What has altered?
p262_305.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p262_306.txt|One was a lawyer.
p262_307.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p262_308.txt|They should be swept away.
p262_309.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p262_310.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p262_311.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p262_312.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p262_313.txt|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p262_314.txt|The letters are going out today.
p262_315.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p262_316.txt|Is there on his hands?
p262_317.txt|Special measures were needed.
p262_318.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p262_319.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p262_320.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p262_321.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p262_322.txt|It should be equal.
p262_323.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p262_324.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p262_325.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p262_326.txt|He said she was mad.
p262_327.txt|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p262_328.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p262_329.txt|We are in the end game.
p262_330.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p262_331.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p262_332.txt|I am so upset.
p262_333.txt|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p262_334.txt|It could have gone either way.
p262_335.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p262_336.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p262_337.txt|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p262_338.txt|The team for the first game could be this one.
p262_339.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p262_340.txt|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p262_341.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p262_342.txt|I would miss him.
p262_343.txt|It will be very, very tight.
p262_344.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p262_345.txt|It was forced to divert.
p262_346.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p262_347.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p262_348.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p262_349.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p262_350.txt|I got a yellow card.
p262_351.txt|There is no link.
p262_352.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p262_353.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p262_354.txt|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p262_355.txt|A man has since been charged with his murder.
p262_356.txt|It is horrible.
p262_357.txt|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p262_358.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p262_359.txt|He's very explosive.
p262_360.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p262_361.txt|We will be homeless.
p262_362.txt|That would help.
p262_363.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p262_364.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p262_365.txt|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p262_366.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p262_367.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p262_368.txt|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p262_369.txt|Talks are progressing.
p262_370.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p262_371.txt|It was a funny game.
p262_372.txt|It is a large number.
p262_373.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p262_374.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p262_375.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p262_376.txt|Something is wrong.
p262_377.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p262_378.txt|I am very happy with life.
p262_379.txt|I was so nervous.
p262_380.txt|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p262_381.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p262_382.txt|It would be a massive boost for them.
p262_383.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p262_384.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p262_385.txt|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p262_386.txt|We're looking for justice.
p262_387.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p262_388.txt|They are good.
p262_389.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p262_390.txt|It was on fire.
p262_391.txt|This is a major step forward for carers.
p262_392.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p262_393.txt|Emotions were complex.
p262_394.txt|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p263_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p263_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p263_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p263_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p263_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p263_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p263_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p263_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p263_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p263_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p263_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p263_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p263_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p263_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p263_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p263_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p263_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p263_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p263_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p263_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p263_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p263_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p263_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p263_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p263_025.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p263_026.txt|How are you, sir ?
p263_027.txt|So is that it, then ?
p263_028.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p263_029.txt|What do we do ?
p263_030.txt|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
p263_031.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p263_032.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p263_033.txt|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p263_034.txt|The idea is not new.
p263_035.txt|I could not do it.
p263_036.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p263_037.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p263_038.txt|You have to expect this type of thing.
p263_039.txt|No company would want to put their people at risk.
p263_040.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p263_041.txt|It could well be the case.
p263_042.txt|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p263_043.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p263_044.txt|It will come all right.
p263_045.txt|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
p263_046.txt|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p263_047.txt|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263_048.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p263_049.txt|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
p263_050.txt|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p263_051.txt|I would love to have him home.
p263_052.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p263_053.txt|He will need that machine.
p263_054.txt|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p263_055.txt|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p263_056.txt|We have not given up hope.
p263_057.txt|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p263_058.txt|I've got to provide for my family.
p263_059.txt|It was bound to happen.
p263_060.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p263_061.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p263_062.txt|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p263_063.txt|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p263_064.txt|I am pleased to be in them.
p263_065.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p263_066.txt|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p263_067.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p263_068.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p263_069.txt|It is the only way forward for the club.
p263_070.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p263_071.txt|It's all I can do.
p263_072.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p263_073.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p263_074.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p263_075.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p263_076.txt|Even the one she loved.
p263_077.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p263_078.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p263_079.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p263_080.txt|And does it ?
p263_081.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p263_082.txt|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p263_083.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p263_084.txt|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p263_085.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p263_086.txt|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p263_087.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p263_088.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p263_089.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p263_090.txt|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p263_091.txt|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p263_092.txt|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263_093.txt|The trick is to try it.
p263_094.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p263_095.txt|It might change your life.
p263_096.txt|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
p263_097.txt|Mr Blair should be warned.
p263_098.txt|You might not make it.
p263_099.txt|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263_100.txt|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p263_101.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p263_102.txt|I did not have a bet on myself.
p263_103.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p263_104.txt|A progress report will be published in October.
p263_105.txt|The investment will be in the food.
p263_106.txt|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p263_107.txt|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p263_108.txt|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p263_109.txt|You are like an animal.
p263_110.txt|In the end we made too many errors.
p263_111.txt|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p263_112.txt|That all hope is never lost.
p263_113.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p263_114.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p263_115.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p263_116.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p263_117.txt|He was jailed for a year.
p263_118.txt|It was won on the issue of the land.
p263_119.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p263_120.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p263_121.txt|Pupils will be the losers.
p263_122.txt|The problem was a social problem.
p263_123.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p263_124.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p263_125.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p263_126.txt|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p263_127.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p263_128.txt|They've got to account for it.
p263_129.txt|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263_130.txt|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
p263_131.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p263_132.txt|I told him I was a long time ago.
p263_133.txt|They have to come clean.
p263_134.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p263_135.txt|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p263_136.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p263_137.txt|It is just a tax on employment.
p263_138.txt|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p263_139.txt|The squad is too small.
p263_140.txt|Why change it ?
p263_141.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p263_142.txt|Does the name matter ?
p263_143.txt|how do you get it back ?
p263_144.txt|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p263_145.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p263_146.txt|Any success would have been an improvement.
p263_147.txt|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p263_148.txt|I never wanted a legal battle.
p263_149.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p263_150.txt|Next time round, it will be different.
p263_151.txt|She died at her home.
p263_152.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p263_153.txt|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p263_154.txt|It is the quality of the work that counts.
p263_155.txt|Check that he is dead.
p263_156.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p263_157.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p263_158.txt|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p263_159.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p263_160.txt|She will do for me.
p263_161.txt|I have had a good life.
p263_162.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p263_163.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p263_164.txt|It is crucial for both teams.
p263_165.txt|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
p263_166.txt|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263_167.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p263_168.txt|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p263_169.txt|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p263_170.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p263_171.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p263_172.txt|These days are long gone.
p263_173.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p263_174.txt|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p263_175.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p263_176.txt|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p263_177.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p263_178.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p263_179.txt|So was the first half.
p263_180.txt|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p263_181.txt|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p263_182.txt|It's nice to be involved.
p263_183.txt|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p263_184.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p263_185.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p263_186.txt|Time is now very short.
p263_187.txt|Our position remains the same.
p263_188.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p263_189.txt|The region is open for business.
p263_190.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p263_191.txt|The championship is different from the other majors.
p263_192.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p263_193.txt|I thought he did very well.
p263_194.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p263_195.txt|The shooting created panic in the street.
p263_196.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p263_197.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p263_198.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p263_199.txt|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263_200.txt|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263_201.txt|It is a terrible loss.
p263_202.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p263_203.txt|Who was she ?
p263_204.txt|Or was it ?
p263_205.txt|And they were being paid ?
p263_206.txt|Two years later, she was dead.
p263_207.txt|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p263_208.txt|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263_209.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p263_210.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p263_211.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p263_212.txt|It is hard to tell.
p263_213.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p263_214.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p263_215.txt|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
p263_216.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p263_217.txt|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p263_218.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p263_219.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p263_220.txt|They are in the euro.
p263_221.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p263_222.txt|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263_223.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p263_224.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p263_225.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p263_226.txt|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p263_227.txt|Abbey National is an option.
p263_228.txt|We can hardly talk about it.
p263_229.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p263_230.txt|It is safe in our hands.
p263_231.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p263_232.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p263_233.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p263_234.txt|It's just a normal life.
p263_235.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p263_236.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p263_237.txt|That you can do it.
p263_238.txt|We will reform the welfare state.
p263_239.txt|It could be to do with the location.
p263_241.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p263_242.txt|She will attend in July.
p263_243.txt|The body follows the mind.
p263_244.txt|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p263_245.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p263_246.txt|That will be the criteria for the future.
p263_247.txt|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p263_248.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p263_249.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p263_250.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p263_251.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p263_252.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p263_253.txt|Did he trip ?
p263_254.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p263_255.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p263_256.txt|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263_257.txt|The irony was not lost.
p263_258.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p263_259.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p263_260.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p263_261.txt|You look like a rugby player.
p263_262.txt|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p263_263.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p263_264.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p263_265.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p263_266.txt|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
p263_267.txt|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p263_268.txt|My son was too young to die.
p263_269.txt|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263_270.txt|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p263_271.txt|I didn't see the point.
p263_272.txt|It seems a shame to leave it.
p263_273.txt|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263_274.txt|I can't get a job.
p263_275.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p263_276.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p263_277.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p263_278.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p263_279.txt|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263_280.txt|They must play for each other.
p263_281.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p263_282.txt|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p263_283.txt|They can leave at any time.
p263_284.txt|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263_285.txt|Much of the equipment was new.
p263_286.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p263_287.txt|An announcement will follow in due course.
p263_288.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p263_289.txt|He was also married with two children.
p263_291.txt|I was first in the door.
p263_292.txt|Access has been a nightmare.
p263_293.txt|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p263_294.txt|It will always be the highlight of my career.
p263_295.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p263_296.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p263_297.txt|She failed in her action.
p263_298.txt|Its body language is all wrong.
p263_299.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p263_300.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p263_301.txt|So the Government will be damaged.
p263_302.txt|I have lost all confidence.
p263_303.txt|John was there already in spirit.
p263_304.txt|In the end, it was no choice.
p263_305.txt|Are they free ?
p263_306.txt|What are they for ?
p263_307.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p263_308.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p263_309.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p263_310.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p263_311.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p263_312.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p263_313.txt|I have decided to stand down from the list.
p263_314.txt|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p263_315.txt|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263_316.txt|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263_317.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p263_318.txt|Nothing has been put into action.
p263_319.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p263_320.txt|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p263_321.txt|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263_322.txt|However, a bid was never made.
p263_323.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p263_324.txt|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
p263_325.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p263_326.txt|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
p263_327.txt|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p263_328.txt|They come to enjoy themselves.
p263_329.txt|There's still a bit to go.
p263_330.txt|We have a good healthy debate.
p263_331.txt|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p263_332.txt|It is a court case.
p263_333.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p263_334.txt|There is no plan B.
p263_335.txt|He will go a long way.
p263_336.txt|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263_337.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p263_338.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p263_339.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p263_340.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p263_341.txt|He is married with three children.
p263_342.txt|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p263_343.txt|It's difficult to predict the future.
p263_344.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p263_345.txt|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p263_346.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p263_347.txt|The airport was even different.
p263_348.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p263_349.txt|It is the same old story.
p263_350.txt|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p263_351.txt|Overall, we are very pleased.
p263_352.txt|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p263_353.txt|Does it matter ?
p263_354.txt|How do you take them away ?
p263_355.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p263_356.txt|After the match, do you ?
p263_357.txt|The pain was almost too much to bear.
p263_358.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p263_359.txt|There is a good example in this city.
p263_360.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p263_361.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p263_362.txt|That's as it should be.
p263_363.txt|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
p263_364.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p263_365.txt|There is a range of employers.
p263_366.txt|But we welcome this document.
p263_367.txt|He did a good job.
p263_368.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p263_369.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p263_370.txt|The value of the merger is still there.
p263_371.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p263_372.txt|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p263_373.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p263_374.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263_375.txt|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
p263_376.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p263_377.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p263_378.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p263_379.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p263_380.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p263_381.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p263_382.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p263_383.txt|The bank was now involved.
p263_384.txt|It was like a weekly wage.
p263_385.txt|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p263_386.txt|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p263_387.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p263_388.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p263_389.txt|This season has been a nightmare.
p263_390.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p263_391.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p263_392.txt|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p263_393.txt|She has a little boy.
p263_394.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p263_395.txt|I was just happy to get my own goal.
p263_396.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p263_397.txt|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p263_398.txt|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263_399.txt|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p263_400.txt|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263_401.txt|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p263_402.txt|He replied that it was a dilemma.
p263_403.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p263_404.txt|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263_405.txt|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
p263_406.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p263_407.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p263_408.txt|It was an amazing afternoon.
p263_409.txt|The casualties were not named.
p263_410.txt|We shall not be moved.
p263_411.txt|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p263_412.txt|It looked like a river.
p263_413.txt|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p263_414.txt|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
p263_415.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p263_416.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p263_417.txt|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p263_418.txt|I had a tie in my hand.
p263_419.txt|I can lead by example.
p263_420.txt|Such an attack is bizarre.
p263_421.txt|Today, the story is different.
p263_422.txt|The Queen Mother is dead.
p263_423.txt|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p263_424.txt|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263_425.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p263_426.txt|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263_427.txt|But we are severely limited in funds.
p263_428.txt|Together, we can make a difference.
p263_429.txt|It is that sort of film.
p263_430.txt|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263_431.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p263_432.txt|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p263_433.txt|Which may be the same thing.
p263_434.txt|It is not a standing army.
p263_435.txt|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p263_436.txt|As it turned out it was a triumph.
p263_437.txt|We shall not forget him.
p263_438.txt|I can't wait for the season to end.
p263_439.txt|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p263_440.txt|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p263_441.txt|You have got to be careful.
p263_442.txt|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p263_443.txt|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p263_444.txt|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p263_445.txt|No, because it was too many.
p263_446.txt|He deserves a second chance.
p263_447.txt|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263_448.txt|It is not over by any means.
p263_449.txt|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p263_450.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p263_451.txt|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p263_452.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p263_453.txt|It looked like a war zone.
p263_454.txt|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
p263_455.txt|However, one has arrived in the post.
p263_456.txt|They offer a kind of narrative.
p263_457.txt|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263_458.txt|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p263_459.txt|It goes with the job.
p263_460.txt|It has been a waste of time.
p263_461.txt|The rest of the business is very robust.
p263_462.txt|I saw it didn't work.
p263_463.txt|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
p263_464.txt|We are over the moon.
p263_465.txt|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263_466.txt|They're just a good retailer.
p263_467.txt|Tickets will be at a premium.
p263_468.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p263_469.txt|I just got under the ball a bit.
p263_470.txt|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263_471.txt|That should get their attention.
p263_472.txt|It's just a place to open it.
p263_473.txt|My place is in the kitchen.
p265_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p265_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p265_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p265_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p265_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p265_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p265_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p265_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p265_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p265_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p265_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p265_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p265_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p265_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p265_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p265_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p265_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p265_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p265_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p265_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p265_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p265_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p265_025.txt|Is this accurate?
p265_026.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p265_027.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p265_028.txt|This is the window.
p265_029.txt|We speak about the performance.
p265_030.txt|It's a fact.
p265_031.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p265_032.txt|It has failed.
p265_033.txt|It was clear.
p265_034.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p265_035.txt|Indeed, he does.
p265_036.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p265_037.txt|Dancing was her life.
p265_038.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p265_039.txt|It's the only thing.
p265_040.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p265_041.txt|A neighbour said.
p265_042.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p265_043.txt|She looked so young.
p265_044.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p265_045.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p265_046.txt|There was no safety net.
p265_047.txt|It is unique.
p265_048.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p265_049.txt|TODAY it begins.
p265_050.txt|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p265_051.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p265_052.txt|It's that kind of place.
p265_053.txt|They are real.
p265_054.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p265_055.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p265_056.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p265_057.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p265_058.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p265_059.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p265_060.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p265_061.txt|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p265_063.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p265_064.txt|Neither it is.
p265_065.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p265_066.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p265_067.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p265_068.txt|The results are tragic.
p265_069.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p265_070.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p265_071.txt|What has changed?
p265_072.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p265_073.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p265_074.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p265_075.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p265_076.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p265_077.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p265_078.txt|They lived for their children.
p265_079.txt|It will be tight.
p265_080.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p265_081.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p265_082.txt|It is a lifeline.
p265_083.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p265_084.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p265_085.txt|This one did.
p265_086.txt|They are now divorced.
p265_087.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p265_088.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p265_089.txt|It was mayhem.
p265_090.txt|Journalists should make him.
p265_091.txt|It is a love affair.
p265_092.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p265_093.txt|May not have been at fault?
p265_094.txt|They tried to deny it.
p265_095.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p265_096.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p265_097.txt|He takes the job.
p265_098.txt|She reflects a bit.
p265_099.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p265_100.txt|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p265_101.txt|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p265_102.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p265_103.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p265_104.txt|It's a shame.
p265_105.txt|It was the eighties.
p265_106.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p265_107.txt|You had better believe it.
p265_108.txt|It is rubbish.
p265_109.txt|Who would be a referee?
p265_110.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p265_111.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p265_112.txt|That's all right then.
p265_113.txt|I'm so angry.
p265_114.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p265_115.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p265_116.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p265_117.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p265_118.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p265_119.txt|They took a risk.
p265_120.txt|We work well together.
p265_121.txt|What will happen then?
p265_122.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p265_123.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p265_124.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p265_125.txt|Is that it?
p265_126.txt|It is a time bomb.
p265_127.txt|I was dead.
p265_128.txt|I don't know the full story.
p265_129.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p265_130.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p265_131.txt|She died at her home.
p265_132.txt|He realises his mistake.
p265_133.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p265_134.txt|The idea is simple.
p265_135.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p265_136.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p265_137.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p265_138.txt|You know the type.
p265_139.txt|I was stunned.
p265_140.txt|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p265_141.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p265_142.txt|They have not been named.
p265_143.txt|We are now up against it.
p265_144.txt|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p265_145.txt|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p265_146.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p265_147.txt|Well, he should know.
p265_148.txt|I will tell you.
p265_149.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p265_150.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p265_151.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p265_152.txt|It has to be now.
p265_153.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p265_154.txt|It is not like us.
p265_155.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p265_156.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p265_157.txt|They will do their own thing.
p265_158.txt|You had to go and see him.
p265_159.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p265_160.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p265_161.txt|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p265_162.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p265_163.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p265_164.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p265_165.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p265_166.txt|He deserved the win.
p265_167.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p265_168.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p265_169.txt|They know no other way.
p265_170.txt|I've been there.
p265_171.txt|It's an idea.
p265_172.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p265_173.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p265_174.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p265_175.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p265_176.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p265_177.txt|Does this matter?
p265_178.txt|One was a lawyer.
p265_179.txt|I put the drawing down.
p265_180.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p265_181.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p265_182.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p265_183.txt|It is a farce.
p265_184.txt|Peace was won.
p265_185.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p265_186.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p265_187.txt|Is that success?
p265_188.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p265_189.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p265_190.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p265_191.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p265_192.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p265_193.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p265_194.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p265_195.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p265_196.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p265_197.txt|I don't want to use it.
p265_198.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p265_199.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p265_200.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p265_201.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p265_202.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p265_203.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p265_204.txt|I might come back.
p265_205.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p265_206.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p265_207.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p265_208.txt|That has been the easy part.
p265_209.txt|But she was.
p265_210.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p265_211.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p265_212.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p265_213.txt|It's not before time.
p265_214.txt|The report is due out next month.
p265_215.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p265_216.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265_217.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p265_218.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p265_219.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p265_220.txt|We were awful.
p265_221.txt|We are so proud.
p265_222.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p265_223.txt|I can leave at the end of the day.
p265_224.txt|Until they came to do it.
p265_225.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p265_226.txt|Wealth is relative.
p265_227.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p265_228.txt|You should be.
p265_229.txt|It's quite nice.
p265_230.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p265_231.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p265_232.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p265_233.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p265_234.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p265_235.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265_236.txt|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p265_237.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p265_238.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p265_239.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p265_240.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p265_241.txt|It was a hit.
p265_242.txt|There's the mix.
p265_243.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p265_244.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265_245.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p265_246.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p265_247.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p265_248.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p265_249.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p265_250.txt|We have to expand.
p265_251.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265_252.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p265_253.txt|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p265_254.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p265_255.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p265_256.txt|Souter will be back.
p265_257.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p265_258.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p265_259.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p265_260.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p265_262.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265_263.txt|It's a way of life.
p265_264.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p265_265.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p265_266.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p265_267.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p265_268.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p265_269.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p265_270.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p265_271.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p265_272.txt|He looked very sharp.
p265_273.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p265_274.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p265_275.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p265_276.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p265_277.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p265_278.txt|It was a virus.
p265_279.txt|Yet, it worked.
p265_280.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p265_281.txt|This is a national crisis.
p265_282.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p265_283.txt|So I did.
p265_284.txt|We are not going to forget.
p265_285.txt|What has altered?
p265_286.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p265_287.txt|There is no openness.
p265_288.txt|I can live with it.
p265_289.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p265_290.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p265_291.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p265_292.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p265_293.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p265_294.txt|You are the glory.
p265_295.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p265_296.txt|The letters are going out today.
p265_297.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
p265_298.txt|Is there on his hands?
p265_299.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p265_300.txt|Kids are terrible.
p265_301.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p265_302.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p265_303.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p265_304.txt|They had a confession.
p265_305.txt|It will work.
p265_306.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p265_307.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p265_308.txt|Either team will be hard.
p265_309.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p265_310.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p265_311.txt|The party is up for it.
p265_312.txt|Is that an issue?
p265_313.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p265_314.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p265_315.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p265_316.txt|Who will do it?
p265_317.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p265_318.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p265_319.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p265_320.txt|I'm very lucky.
p265_321.txt|It's very good.
p265_322.txt|This is a friendly match?
p265_323.txt|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p265_324.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p265_325.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p265_326.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p265_327.txt|Tell us about it.
p265_328.txt|She said they would appeal.
p265_329.txt|But we finished the show.
p265_330.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p265_331.txt|There is no excuse.
p265_332.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p265_333.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p265_334.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p265_335.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p265_336.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p265_337.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p265_338.txt|That would help.
p265_339.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p265_340.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p265_341.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p265_342.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p265_343.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p265_344.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p265_345.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p265_346.txt|It's been hard.
p265_347.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p265_348.txt|A review is under way.
p265_349.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p265_350.txt|So there, we won.
p265_351.txt|He was the architect.
p265_352.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p266_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p266_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p266_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p266_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p266_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p266_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p266_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p266_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p266_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p266_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p266_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p266_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p266_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p266_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p266_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p266_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p266_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p266_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p266_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p266_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p266_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p266_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p266_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p266_025.txt|She looked so young.
p266_026.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p266_027.txt|Is this accurate?
p266_028.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p266_029.txt|There's a story, too.
p266_030.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p266_031.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p266_032.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p266_033.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p266_034.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p266_035.txt|It was clear.
p266_036.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p266_037.txt|Indeed, he does.
p266_038.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p266_039.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p266_040.txt|Dancing was her life.
p266_041.txt|It's the only thing.
p266_042.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p266_043.txt|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p266_044.txt|A neighbour said.
p266_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p266_046.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p266_047.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p266_048.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p266_049.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p266_050.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p266_051.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p266_052.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p266_053.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p266_054.txt|What was the main difference?
p266_055.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p266_056.txt|They're appalled by that.
p266_057.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p266_058.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p266_059.txt|We should have known.
p266_060.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p266_061.txt|We recorded it at our own expense.
p266_062.txt|Try to save us.
p266_063.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p266_064.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p266_065.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p266_066.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p266_067.txt|It's all I can do.
p266_068.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p266_069.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p266_070.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p266_071.txt|Neither it is.
p266_072.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p266_073.txt|It works for us.
p266_074.txt|The party is up for it.
p266_075.txt|Even the one she loved.
p266_076.txt|Today she has been released.
p266_077.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p266_078.txt|I will miss him.
p266_079.txt|He is in the queue.
p266_080.txt|I first met him last summer.
p266_081.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p266_082.txt|He is driven.
p266_083.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p266_084.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p266_085.txt|Someone who cares
p266_086.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p266_087.txt|They lived for their children.
p266_088.txt|It will be tight.
p266_089.txt|It is a lifeline.
p266_090.txt|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p266_091.txt|It's good news.
p266_092.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p266_093.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p266_094.txt|I love the Dome.
p266_095.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p266_096.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p266_097.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p266_098.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p266_099.txt|Journalists should make him.
p266_100.txt|May not have been at fault?
p266_101.txt|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p266_102.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p266_103.txt|That would be unlawful.
p266_104.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p266_105.txt|He takes the job.
p266_106.txt|She reflects a bit.
p266_107.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p266_108.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p266_109.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p266_110.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p266_111.txt|It was a funny game.
p266_112.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p266_113.txt|Is that right?
p266_114.txt|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p266_115.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p266_116.txt|It's a shame.
p266_117.txt|It was the eighties.
p266_118.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p266_119.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p266_120.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p266_121.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p266_122.txt|Who would have?
p266_123.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p266_124.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p266_125.txt|I'm so angry.
p266_126.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p266_127.txt|I was on a roll.
p266_128.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p266_129.txt|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p266_130.txt|We work well together.
p266_131.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p266_132.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p266_133.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p266_134.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p266_135.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p266_136.txt|Is that it?
p266_137.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p266_138.txt|I was dead.
p266_139.txt|I don't know the full story.
p266_140.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p266_141.txt|Who would be right?
p266_142.txt|She died at her home.
p266_143.txt|He realises his mistake.
p266_144.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p266_145.txt|I was awful.
p266_146.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p266_147.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p266_148.txt|It is not just about pay.
p266_149.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p266_150.txt|So I got a blood test.
p266_151.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p266_152.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p266_153.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p266_154.txt|They have not been named.
p266_155.txt|I might come back.
p266_156.txt|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p266_157.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p266_158.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p266_159.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p266_160.txt|There's a pause.
p266_161.txt|Was this element always there?
p266_162.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p266_163.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p266_164.txt|We need a new kind of theatre.
p266_165.txt|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p266_166.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p266_167.txt|We try to keep it right.
p266_168.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p266_169.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p266_170.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p266_171.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p266_172.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p266_173.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p266_174.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p266_175.txt|One season, they might do well.
p266_176.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p266_177.txt|As we worked.
p266_178.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p266_179.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p266_180.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p266_181.txt|I've been there.
p266_182.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p266_183.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p266_184.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p266_186.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p266_187.txt|Our team is just so young.
p266_188.txt|O Neill has delivered.
p266_189.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p266_190.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p266_191.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p266_192.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p266_193.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p266_194.txt|Is that success?
p266_195.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p266_196.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p266_197.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p266_198.txt|Who will pay for this?
p266_199.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p266_200.txt|It's just awful.
p266_201.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p266_202.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p266_203.txt|He knows a lot.
p266_204.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p266_205.txt|It had all been arranged.
p266_206.txt|It's not before time.
p266_207.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p266_208.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p266_209.txt|I was so nervous.
p266_210.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p266_211.txt|Work has started.
p266_212.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p266_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p266_214.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p266_215.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p266_216.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p266_217.txt|Saturday is gone.
p266_218.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p266_219.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p266_220.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p266_221.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p266_222.txt|I will win.
p266_223.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p266_224.txt|The report is due out next month.
p266_225.txt|We were awful.
p266_226.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p266_227.txt|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266_228.txt|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p266_229.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p266_230.txt|There is no excuse.
p266_231.txt|It's quite nice.
p266_232.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p266_233.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p266_234.txt|It's a killer piece.
p266_235.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p266_236.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p266_237.txt|It is hard won.
p266_238.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p266_239.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p266_240.txt|The scene is about this?
p266_241.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p266_242.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p266_243.txt|My son was too young to die.
p266_244.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p266_245.txt|I should think so, too.
p266_246.txt|It was a hit.
p266_247.txt|There's the mix.
p266_248.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p266_249.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p266_250.txt|We are in a war.
p266_251.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p266_252.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p266_253.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p266_254.txt|It was like the old days.
p266_255.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p266_256.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p266_257.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p266_258.txt|We have to expand.
p266_259.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p266_260.txt|Souter will be back.
p266_261.txt|Note the date.
p266_262.txt|It will be done in stages.
p266_263.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266_264.txt|You take a risk.
p266_265.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p266_266.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p266_267.txt|He was also married with two children.
p266_268.txt|The system can work.
p266_269.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p266_270.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p266_271.txt|We're in shock.
p266_272.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p266_273.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p266_274.txt|That goes back a long way.
p266_275.txt|It was very fast.
p266_276.txt|She failed in her action.
p266_277.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p266_278.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p266_279.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p266_280.txt|It's so awful.
p266_281.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p266_282.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266_283.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p266_284.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p266_285.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p266_286.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p266_287.txt|Tony Blair said as little.
p266_288.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p266_289.txt|It was good.
p266_290.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p266_291.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p266_292.txt|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p266_293.txt|It could well be military.
p266_294.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p266_295.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p266_296.txt|Spent three months alone at sea.
p266_297.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p266_298.txt|There was a vacuum.
p266_299.txt|We lost a boy.
p266_300.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p266_301.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p266_302.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p266_303.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p266_304.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p266_305.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p266_306.txt|I can give no comment.
p266_307.txt|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p266_308.txt|This is a war over our home.
p266_309.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p266_310.txt|The plot is minimal.
p266_311.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p266_312.txt|You should be.
p266_313.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p266_314.txt|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p266_315.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p266_316.txt|Your father was a good man.
p266_317.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p266_318.txt|You may have a short memory.
p266_319.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p266_320.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p266_321.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p266_322.txt|A review is under way.
p266_323.txt|We are in the end game.
p266_324.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p266_325.txt|The airport was even different.
p266_326.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p266_327.txt|There was no time scale.
p266_328.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p266_329.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p266_330.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p266_331.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p266_332.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p266_333.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p266_334.txt|Who will do it?
p266_335.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p266_336.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p266_337.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p266_338.txt|We've tried every other way.
p266_339.txt|This is a big advantage.
p266_340.txt|Maloney was asked.
p266_341.txt|But I was knocked out by the city.
p266_342.txt|went on sale.
p266_343.txt|I'm very lucky.
p266_344.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p266_345.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p266_346.txt|It is long gone.
p266_347.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p266_348.txt|Tell us about it.
p266_349.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p266_350.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p266_351.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p266_352.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p266_353.txt|She is free.
p266_354.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p266_355.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p266_356.txt|Yet he left a few days later.
p266_357.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p266_358.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p266_359.txt|We will be homeless.
p266_360.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p266_361.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266_362.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p266_363.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p266_364.txt|Not so, it seems.
p266_365.txt|He was also a great man.
p266_366.txt|He could make it.
p266_367.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p266_368.txt|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p266_369.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p266_370.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p266_371.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p266_372.txt|It is a simple equation.
p266_373.txt|So there, we won.
p266_374.txt|But I managed.
p266_375.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p266_376.txt|There is no signature.
p266_377.txt|The task is enormous.
p266_378.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266_379.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p266_380.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p266_381.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p266_382.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p266_384.txt|It's like a car crash.
p266_385.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p266_386.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p266_387.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p266_388.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p266_389.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p266_390.txt|It is unusual.
p266_391.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p266_392.txt|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p266_393.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p266_394.txt|They are good.
p266_395.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p266_396.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p266_397.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p266_398.txt|What happened in the summer?
p266_399.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p266_400.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p266_401.txt|Emotions were complex.
p266_402.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p266_403.txt|So I did.
p266_404.txt|It's an absolute nonsense.
p266_405.txt|I knew the script.
p266_406.txt|They were kept there for a summer.
p266_407.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p266_408.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p266_409.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p266_410.txt|He got his degree.
p266_411.txt|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p266_412.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p266_413.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p266_414.txt|But we finished the show.
p266_415.txt|He was really great.
p266_416.txt|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p266_417.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p266_418.txt|That may be.
p266_419.txt|It is legally binding.
p266_420.txt|Paris is not only young.
p266_421.txt|Such as it is.
p266_422.txt|It looked like a war zone.
p266_423.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p266_424.txt|I chose to make a film.
p267_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p267_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p267_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p267_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p267_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p267_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p267_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p267_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p267_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p267_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p267_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p267_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p267_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p267_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p267_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p267_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p267_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p267_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p267_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p267_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p267_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p267_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p267_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p267_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p267_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p267_026.txt|He may not need to force that message.
p267_027.txt|There is no reason at all.
p267_028.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p267_029.txt|Because we do not need it.
p267_030.txt|We will look into it.
p267_031.txt|This is a central issue.
p267_032.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p267_033.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p267_034.txt|I became a widow overnight.
p267_035.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p267_036.txt|A week is a long time in politics.
p267_037.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p267_038.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p267_039.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p267_040.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p267_041.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p267_042.txt|He is too weak to move.
p267_043.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p267_044.txt|This is the interesting part.
p267_045.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p267_046.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p267_047.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p267_048.txt|There was no safety net.
p267_049.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p267_050.txt|It is a different animal.
p267_051.txt|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p267_052.txt|I must take a seat.
p267_053.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p267_054.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p267_055.txt|So I liked the challenge.
p267_056.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p267_057.txt|That way I won't have to do anything.
p267_058.txt|It's just the timing of the game.
p267_059.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p267_060.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p267_061.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p267_062.txt|They are in the euro.
p267_063.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p267_064.txt|How are you, sir ?
p267_065.txt|So is that it, then ?
p267_066.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p267_067.txt|There could be a way back.
p267_068.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p267_069.txt|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p267_070.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p267_071.txt|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p267_072.txt|A government is a government is a government.
p267_073.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p267_074.txt|That is bound to happen.
p267_075.txt|He is in the queue.
p267_076.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p267_077.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p267_078.txt|He can win every week.
p267_079.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p267_080.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p267_081.txt|They lived for their children.
p267_082.txt|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p267_083.txt|There was no way back for United after that.
p267_084.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p267_085.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p267_086.txt|They need to find a form of words.
p267_087.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p267_088.txt|It's for that reason he should resign.
p267_089.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p267_090.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p267_091.txt|Our house was very small.
p267_092.txt|They were a lovely couple.
p267_093.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p267_094.txt|It's not a lack of effort.
p267_095.txt|That means an extra two years.
p267_096.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p267_097.txt|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p267_098.txt|Sport is good for you.
p267_099.txt|We need to handle it.
p267_100.txt|They will notice a difference.
p267_102.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p267_103.txt|He has done that with a great deal to spare.
p267_104.txt|Then again, we could have.
p267_105.txt|She's got to say something.
p267_106.txt|I was always a little behind.
p267_107.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p267_108.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p267_109.txt|We have a training class.
p267_110.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p267_111.txt|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p267_112.txt|I was on a roll.
p267_113.txt|What do we do ?
p267_114.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p267_115.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p267_116.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p267_117.txt|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p267_118.txt|We did what we had to do.
p267_119.txt|I am the Son of Sam.
p267_120.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p267_121.txt|Tiger is not the norm.
p267_122.txt|My conscience is not clear.
p267_123.txt|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p267_124.txt|It would make a lot of sense.
p267_125.txt|They could use a boost.
p267_126.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p267_127.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p267_128.txt|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
p267_129.txt|He was seen as the enemy.
p267_130.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p267_131.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p267_132.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p267_133.txt|It was a piece of art.
p267_134.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p267_135.txt|So I got a blood test.
p267_136.txt|It has become a way of life.
p267_137.txt|I was caught out a little bit.
p267_138.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p267_139.txt|It has to be an event.
p267_140.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p267_141.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p267_142.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p267_143.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p267_144.txt|It was by the numbers.
p267_145.txt|We will turn the corner.
p267_146.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p267_147.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p267_148.txt|There was a definite prejudice.
p267_149.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p267_150.txt|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p267_151.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p267_152.txt|That is not too bad.
p267_153.txt|We are still getting over it.
p267_154.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p267_155.txt|We came across the first set of bodies.
p267_156.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p267_157.txt|I would probably have to agree with him.
p267_158.txt|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p267_159.txt|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p267_160.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p267_161.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p267_162.txt|And does it ?
p267_163.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p267_164.txt|Had I heard ?
p267_165.txt|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p267_166.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p267_167.txt|The people are the hero.
p267_168.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p267_169.txt|It is premature to speculate on the impact.
p267_170.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p267_171.txt|It is a body blow.
p267_172.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p267_173.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p267_174.txt|It is not a threat.
p267_175.txt|I would not count on it.
p267_176.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p267_177.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p267_178.txt|The referee had a good game.
p267_179.txt|The European Union is a case in point.
p267_180.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p267_181.txt|It is a common problem.
p267_182.txt|A team is a team.
p267_183.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p267_184.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p267_185.txt|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p267_186.txt|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p267_187.txt|People will ask about us.
p267_188.txt|I had come back from London.
p267_189.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p267_190.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p267_191.txt|Final proposals will be published in February.
p267_192.txt|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p267_193.txt|If I was a woman.
p267_194.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p267_195.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p267_196.txt|The conference is the first test.
p267_197.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p267_198.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p267_199.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p267_200.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p267_201.txt|A bit of match fitness is required.
p267_202.txt|It is an impressive record.
p267_203.txt|There is no quick fix.
p267_204.txt|Abbey National is an option.
p267_205.txt|It has been like that all year for me.
p267_206.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p267_207.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p267_208.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p267_209.txt|I had relied on him.
p267_210.txt|The course has helped a lot.
p267_211.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p267_212.txt|My life is in the ballet.
p267_213.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p267_214.txt|They're going to open in early summer.
p267_215.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p267_216.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p267_217.txt|It is good for our team.
p267_218.txt|It was a crazy day.
p267_219.txt|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p267_220.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p267_221.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p267_222.txt|You have to do your research.
p267_223.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p267_224.txt|Does the name matter ?
p267_225.txt|how do you get it back ?
p267_226.txt|What are you not good at ?
p267_227.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p267_228.txt|You could feel the heat.
p267_229.txt|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p267_230.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p267_231.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p267_232.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p267_233.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p267_234.txt|And he goes with it.
p267_235.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p267_236.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p267_237.txt|She died in middle age.
p267_238.txt|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p267_239.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p267_240.txt|You will have seen the adverts.
p267_242.txt|It is the loss of my name.
p267_243.txt|The irony was not lost.
p267_244.txt|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p267_245.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p267_246.txt|It is a court case.
p267_247.txt|He has been a success this year.
p267_248.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p267_249.txt|He declined to give any details.
p267_250.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p267_251.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p267_252.txt|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p267_253.txt|His is a global perspective.
p267_254.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p267_255.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p267_256.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p267_257.txt|It was a cry for help.
p267_258.txt|They were back in full training yesterday.
p267_259.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p267_260.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p267_261.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p267_262.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p267_263.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p267_264.txt|I can't get a job.
p267_265.txt|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p267_266.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p267_267.txt|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p267_268.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p267_269.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p267_270.txt|It is also very valuable.
p267_271.txt|It disappeared into the cup.
p267_272.txt|The stage was set for a showdown.
p267_273.txt|Not many companies can say that these days.
p267_274.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p267_275.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p267_276.txt|A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
p267_277.txt|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p267_278.txt|It is set in Paris.
p267_279.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p267_280.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p267_281.txt|He was also married with two children.
p267_282.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p267_283.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p267_284.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p267_285.txt|That goes back a long way.
p267_286.txt|And they were being paid ?
p267_287.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p267_288.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p267_289.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p267_290.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p267_291.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p267_292.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p267_293.txt|We have a plan in place.
p267_294.txt|I felt like I was a child.
p267_295.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p267_296.txt|He wants to talk a lot.
p267_297.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p267_298.txt|It is inherent in society.
p267_299.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p267_300.txt|It's difficult to predict the future.
p267_301.txt|That is the general feeling.
p267_302.txt|I am a retailer by nature.
p267_303.txt|Well, he can do it.
p267_304.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p267_305.txt|The judge was really nice.
p267_306.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p267_307.txt|It is a potential danger.
p267_308.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p267_309.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p267_310.txt|It is a road of death.
p267_311.txt|We will make a statement tomorrow.
p267_312.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p267_313.txt|You will never get a conviction.
p267_314.txt|I will not be afraid.
p267_316.txt|He has left the company.
p267_317.txt|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
p267_318.txt|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p267_319.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p267_320.txt|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p267_321.txt|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p267_322.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p267_323.txt|After some discussion they did.
p267_325.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p267_326.txt|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p267_327.txt|You are looking at him.
p267_328.txt|This is a source of real concern for the area.
p267_329.txt|It's not an easy life.
p267_330.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p267_331.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p267_332.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p267_333.txt|It makes a compelling display.
p267_334.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p267_335.txt|But the New Year was special.
p267_336.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p267_337.txt|There was no time scale.
p267_338.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p267_339.txt|Did it work ?
p267_340.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p267_341.txt|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p267_342.txt|It is a strong case.
p267_343.txt|A report is expected next month.
p267_344.txt|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p267_345.txt|They were the acts of men.
p267_346.txt|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p267_347.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p267_348.txt|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p267_349.txt|He is not very big, either.
p267_350.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p267_351.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p267_352.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p267_353.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p267_354.txt|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p267_355.txt|He did a good job.
p267_356.txt|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p267_357.txt|It is a stroke of genius.
p267_358.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p267_359.txt|We live on an island.
p267_360.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p267_361.txt|They have created a business.
p267_362.txt|I got a yellow card.
p267_363.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p267_364.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p267_365.txt|This is a major championship.
p267_366.txt|It's only a matter of scale.
p267_367.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p267_368.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p267_369.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p267_370.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p267_371.txt|to have products for their needs.
p267_372.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p267_373.txt|They are used to the big stage.
p267_374.txt|The marshall at the turn was great.
p267_375.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p267_376.txt|The seller was not revealed.
p267_377.txt|People are on the alert.
p267_378.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p267_379.txt|In fact, he was great today.
p267_380.txt|We operate as a Scottish company.
p267_381.txt|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p267_382.txt|A review is under way.
p267_383.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p267_384.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p267_385.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p267_386.txt|We have made no final decisions.
p267_387.txt|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p267_388.txt|The results will take second place.
p267_389.txt|It was a funny game.
p267_390.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p267_391.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p267_392.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p267_393.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p267_394.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p267_395.txt|We shall not be moved.
p267_396.txt|I watch the other visitors.
p267_397.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p267_398.txt|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p267_399.txt|That's all I can say.
p267_400.txt|Are they free ?
p267_401.txt|What are they for ?
p267_402.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p267_403.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p267_404.txt|You thought it was a headache.
p267_405.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p267_406.txt|I thought he was an animal.
p267_407.txt|None of the agencies was able to help.
p267_408.txt|We will stand for the nation.
p267_409.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p267_410.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p267_411.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p267_412.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p267_413.txt|Such an attack is bizarre.
p267_414.txt|These guys are looking for business.
p267_415.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p267_416.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p267_417.txt|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p267_418.txt|Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
p267_419.txt|It needs to be volatile.
p267_420.txt|I've got my own ideas.
p267_421.txt|Nobody should believe this story.
p268_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p268_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p268_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p268_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p268_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p268_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p268_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p268_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p268_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p268_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p268_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p268_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p268_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p268_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p268_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p268_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p268_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p268_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p268_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p268_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p268_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p268_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p268_025.txt|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p268_026.txt|He got very close tonight.
p268_027.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p268_028.txt|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
p268_029.txt|The first appeared to be successful.
p268_030.txt|We must convince the citizens.
p268_031.txt|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p268_032.txt|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p268_033.txt|Further management changes are planned.
p268_034.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p268_035.txt|It's as we were yesterday.
p268_036.txt|We are opening an inquiry.
p268_037.txt|He works at the airport.
p268_038.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p268_039.txt|How are you, sir ?
p268_040.txt|So is that it, then ?
p268_041.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p268_042.txt|What do we do ?
p268_043.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p268_044.txt|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
p268_045.txt|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p268_046.txt|Something has to give sometime.
p268_047.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p268_048.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p268_049.txt|The latter option was chosen.
p268_050.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p268_051.txt|The man became a reporter.
p268_052.txt|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p268_053.txt|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
p268_054.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p268_055.txt|I knew my contract was up this year.
p268_056.txt|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p268_057.txt|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p268_058.txt|It was just too much for us.
p268_059.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p268_060.txt|They desperately want some stability.
p268_061.txt|Everything is possible in football.
p268_062.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p268_063.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p268_064.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p268_065.txt|He will need that machine.
p268_066.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p268_067.txt|I would not say that.
p268_068.txt|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
p268_069.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p268_070.txt|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
p268_071.txt|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p268_072.txt|We deserved the three points.
p268_073.txt|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p268_074.txt|I am relishing the challenge.
p268_075.txt|Let's hope that it does.
p268_076.txt|But the organisers refused to worry.
p268_077.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p268_078.txt|We should be able to cope.
p268_079.txt|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
p268_080.txt|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p268_081.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p268_082.txt|But I had never been in a theatre.
p268_083.txt|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p268_084.txt|Kenny Miller might come through.
p268_085.txt|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p268_086.txt|He's not getting into any games.
p268_087.txt|We will pay their bills.
p268_088.txt|It is time for new ways for the church.
p268_089.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p268_090.txt|I am glad I wasn't in it.
p268_091.txt|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p268_092.txt|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
p268_093.txt|Final proposals will be published in February.
p268_094.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p268_095.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p268_096.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p268_097.txt|And does it ?
p268_098.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p268_099.txt|Had I heard ?
p268_100.txt|What happened in that game ?
p268_101.txt|Are you going to win ?
p268_102.txt|You should try to have a laugh.
p268_103.txt|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p268_104.txt|He will be kept informed.
p268_105.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p268_106.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p268_107.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p268_108.txt|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
p268_109.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p268_110.txt|Instead, another depression came in.
p268_111.txt|Even the one she loved.
p268_112.txt|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p268_113.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p268_114.txt|Well, he is an artist.
p268_115.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p268_116.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p268_117.txt|Those people must be accountable.
p268_118.txt|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p268_119.txt|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p268_120.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p268_121.txt|Or so the story goes.
p268_122.txt|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p268_123.txt|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p268_124.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p268_125.txt|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p268_126.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p268_127.txt|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
p268_128.txt|Their season has been consigned to history.
p268_129.txt|It wasn't possible to relax.
p268_130.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p268_131.txt|But then they scored their fourth.
p268_132.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p268_133.txt|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p268_134.txt|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p268_135.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p268_137.txt|All the employees are redundant.
p268_138.txt|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p268_139.txt|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p268_140.txt|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p268_141.txt|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p268_142.txt|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p268_143.txt|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p268_144.txt|He was forced to quit.
p268_145.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p268_146.txt|Does the name matter ?
p268_147.txt|how do you get it back ?
p268_148.txt|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p268_149.txt|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p268_150.txt|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p268_151.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268_152.txt|We're not taking any risks.
p268_153.txt|It's very dangerous for markets.
p268_154.txt|That's what happened against Ayr.
p268_155.txt|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.

p268_172.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p268_173.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p268_174.txt|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.

p268_228.txt|There's always the next century.
p268_229.txt|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p268_230.txt|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p268_231.txt|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p268_232.txt|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p268_233.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p268_234.txt|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p268_235.txt|They've got some extremely good players.
p268_236.txt|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.

p268_238.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p268_239.txt|Did it work ?
p268_240.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p268_241.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p268_242.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.

p268_244.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.

p268_270.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p268_271.txt|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p268_272.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p268_273.txt|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
p268_274.txt|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p268_275.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p268_276.txt|Clearly, they had other problems.
p268_277.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p268_278.txt|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p268_279.txt|Phase one was a shambles.
p268_280.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p268_282.txt|A winter of discontent awaits.
p268_283.txt|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
p268_284.txt|Injuries have taken their toll.
p268_285.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p268_286.txt|How independent is that ?
p268_287.txt|What form did that take ?
p268_288.txt|Are they free ?
p268_289.txt|What are they for ?
p268_290.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p268_291.txt|When she went off it was quite amazing.

p268_297.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p268_298.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p268_299.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p268_300.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p268_301.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p268_302.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p268_303.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p268_304.txt|They will probably come back.
p268_305.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p268_306.txt|It caused a lot of upset.

p268_308.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.

p268_322.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p268_323.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.

p268_326.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p268_327.txt|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.

p268_330.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p268_331.txt|We have an election in eight days.

p268_340.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p268_341.txt|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p268_342.txt|Plans were made to expand.
p268_343.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p268_344.txt|Does it matter ?
p268_345.txt|How do you take them away ?
p268_346.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p268_347.txt|After the match, do you ?
p268_348.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p268_349.txt|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p268_350.txt|I am considered a teenager.

p268_369.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p268_370.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p268_371.txt|He looked at me before replying.
p268_372.txt|I have little time for analysts.
p268_373.txt|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
p268_374.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p268_375.txt|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p268_376.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p268_377.txt|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p268_378.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p268_379.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p268_380.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p268_381.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.

p268_383.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p268_384.txt|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.

p268_392.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p268_393.txt|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.

p269_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p269_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p269_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p269_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p269_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p269_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p269_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p269_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p269_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p269_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p269_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p269_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p269_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p269_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p269_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p269_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p269_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p269_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p269_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p269_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p269_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
p269_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p269_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p269_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p269_026.txt|But it failed.
p269_027.txt|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p269_028.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p269_029.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p269_030.txt|I have a theory.
p269_031.txt|Is this accurate?
p269_032.txt|Because we do not need it.
p269_033.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p269_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.

p269_038.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p269_039.txt|That's no bad thing.

p269_050.txt|I was inspired by two things.

p269_067.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p269_068.txt|You need a trademark.
p269_069.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p269_070.txt|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p269_071.txt|It's a winner.
p269_072.txt|There could be a way back.
p269_073.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p269_074.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p269_075.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p269_076.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p269_077.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p269_078.txt|He is now resident in England.
p269_079.txt|Even the one she loved.
p269_080.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p269_081.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p269_082.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p269_083.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p269_084.txt|That is bound to happen.
p269_085.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p269_086.txt|All options are open.
p269_087.txt|Someone who cares
p269_088.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p269_089.txt|You will be.
p269_090.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p269_091.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p269_092.txt|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.

p269_105.txt|It's not perfect.
p269_106.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p269_107.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p269_108.txt|It was quite rigorous.
p269_109.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p269_110.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p269_111.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p269_112.txt|It was the eighties.
p269_113.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p269_114.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p269_115.txt|Maybe this battle has been.

p269_151.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p269_152.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p269_153.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p269_154.txt|It's like a football team.
p269_155.txt|It would be a last resort.

p269_272.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.

p269_275.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p269_276.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.

p269_281.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p269_282.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p269_283.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p269_284.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p269_285.txt|It happens from time to time.
p269_286.txt|If not, he should go home.
p269_287.txt|They were too hard.
p269_288.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p269_289.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p269_290.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p269_291.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_292.txt|It was a virus.

p269_318.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p269_319.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p269_320.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.

p269_333.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p269_334.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p269_335.txt|They had a confession.
p269_336.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p269_337.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p269_338.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p269_339.txt|That's the law of the land.
p269_340.txt|There was no time scale.
p269_341.txt|It is a strong case.
p269_342.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p269_343.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p269_344.txt|The boat was fantastic.

p269_360.txt|It should be scrapped.
p269_361.txt|It is long gone.
p269_362.txt|I HAVE a dream.
p269_363.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p269_364.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p269_365.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p269_366.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p269_367.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p269_368.txt|We will be homeless.
p269_369.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p269_370.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.

p269_373.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.

p269_377.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p269_378.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p269_379.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p269_380.txt|They play together perfectly.
p269_381.txt|It is a large number.
p269_382.txt|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p269_383.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p269_384.txt|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p269_385.txt|He denied the charge.
p269_386.txt|You can cope with it.
p269_387.txt|I am very happy with life.
p269_388.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p269_389.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p269_391.txt|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
p269_392.txt|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p269_393.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p269_394.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p269_395.txt|It is unusual.
p269_396.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p269_397.txt|I suspect the latter.
p269_398.txt|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269_399.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p269_400.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p269_401.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p269_402.txt|The car was just there.
p269_403.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p270_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p270_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p270_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p270_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p270_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p270_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p270_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p270_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p270_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p270_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p270_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p270_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p270_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p270_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p270_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p270_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p270_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p270_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p270_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p270_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p270_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p270_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p270_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p270_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p270_025.txt|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.

p270_027.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p270_028.txt|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p270_029.txt|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p270_030.txt|He has the courage of the unaware.
p270_031.txt|Drugs are a serious problem.
p270_032.txt|We have to find a way to put that right.
p270_033.txt|That is the face of fear.
p270_034.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p270_035.txt|Costs have got to be controlled.
p270_036.txt|He really is a lovely man.
p270_037.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p270_038.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p270_039.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p270_040.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p270_041.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p270_042.txt|Merger would be entirely logical.
p270_043.txt|Must be prepared to use it.
p270_044.txt|Not if you know the person.
p270_045.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p270_046.txt|I had come back from London.
p270_047.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p270_048.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p270_049.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p270_050.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p270_051.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p270_052.txt|Is it worth it ?
p270_053.txt|Does it matter ?
p270_054.txt|How do you take them away ?
p270_055.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p270_056.txt|After the match, do you ?
p270_057.txt|Because we do not need it.
p270_058.txt|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p270_059.txt|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p270_060.txt|We have not given up hope.
p270_061.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.

p270_074.txt|It is not in my nature.
p270_075.txt|My immune system had been depleted.
p270_076.txt|It was a unanimous decision.
p270_077.txt|It makes for an interesting conference.
p270_078.txt|I've had it for the exams.

p270_119.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p270_120.txt|You can spend money on housing.

p270_132.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p270_133.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p270_134.txt|So what happens next ?
p270_135.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p270_136.txt|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p270_137.txt|The first half was depressing.
p270_138.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p270_139.txt|Italy was just behind the US.

p270_141.txt|I feel very grateful with everything.
p270_142.txt|There was an element of frustration.
p270_143.txt|Before it was an ordeal.
p270_144.txt|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.

p270_157.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p270_158.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?

p270_160.txt|How independent is that ?
p270_161.txt|What form did that take ?
p270_162.txt|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p270_163.txt|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p270_164.txt|The woman was his wife.
p270_165.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p270_166.txt|Scotland came very close in the second Test.

p270_181.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p270_182.txt|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p270_183.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p270_184.txt|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p270_185.txt|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p270_186.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p270_187.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p270_188.txt|That's not fair to the supporters.
p270_189.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p270_190.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p270_191.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p270_192.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p270_193.txt|They were seriously after him.
p270_194.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p270_195.txt|We represent a wide range of society.

p270_198.txt|I know every village and island on the west coast.
p270_199.txt|Mr Blair was ready for him.

p270_208.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p270_209.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p270_210.txt|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p270_211.txt|I am very realistic about these things.
p270_212.txt|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p270_213.txt|They are looking at a flotation.
p270_214.txt|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p270_215.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p270_216.txt|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
p270_217.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p270_218.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p270_219.txt|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p270_220.txt|It had all been arranged.
p270_221.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p270_222.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p270_223.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p270_224.txt|Did he trip ?
p270_225.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p270_226.txt|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p270_227.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p270_228.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p270_229.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p270_230.txt|There's a chance they might come down.
p270_231.txt|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p270_232.txt|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p270_233.txt|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p270_234.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p270_235.txt|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.

p270_237.txt|That was a real challenge.
p270_238.txt|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p270_239.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p270_240.txt|We were a shambles at the back.

p270_243.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p270_244.txt|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p270_245.txt|This would include the GM food industry.
p270_246.txt|And he goes with it.
p270_247.txt|It had so much to do with output.
p270_248.txt|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p270_249.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p270_250.txt|The irony was not lost.
p270_251.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p270_252.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p270_253.txt|Everything depends on the weather.
p270_254.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p270_255.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p270_256.txt|Labour was too busy to respond.
p270_257.txt|I was just getting over the time difference.
p270_258.txt|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p270_259.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p270_260.txt|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p270_261.txt|You're not getting any goodwill.
p270_262.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p270_263.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p270_264.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p270_265.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p270_266.txt|We accept the new rules.
p270_267.txt|It is probably in the culture.
p270_268.txt|He took over our lives.
p270_269.txt|I'd never run for them.
p270_270.txt|how do you get it back ?
p270_271.txt|What are you not good at ?
p270_272.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p270_273.txt|Who was she ?
p270_274.txt|Or was it ?
p270_275.txt|And they were being paid ?
p270_276.txt|These figures are truly terrible.
p270_277.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p270_278.txt|He could see no other bidder.
p270_279.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p270_280.txt|None of this work is guaranteed.
p270_281.txt|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p270_282.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p270_283.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p270_284.txt|I understand the security issue.
p270_285.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p270_286.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p270_287.txt|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p270_288.txt|It was never a free kick.
p270_289.txt|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p270_290.txt|It involved the same people.
p270_291.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p270_292.txt|You have to expect this type of thing.
p270_293.txt|There's always the next century.
p270_294.txt|It's hard to see it.
p270_295.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p270_296.txt|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p270_297.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p270_298.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p270_299.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p270_300.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p270_301.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p270_302.txt|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p270_303.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p270_304.txt|It would be great to win the title again.
p270_305.txt|It could well be military.
p270_306.txt|Selection is not in my hands at all.
p270_307.txt|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
p270_308.txt|The songs are just so good.
p270_309.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p270_310.txt|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p270_311.txt|The world record is suspicious.

p270_316.txt|It is a road of death.
p270_317.txt|The pound has also suffered.
p270_318.txt|He has left the company.
p270_319.txt|What happened in that game ?
p270_320.txt|Are you going to win ?
p270_321.txt|Was it the wife ?
p270_322.txt|Why change it ?
p270_323.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p270_324.txt|Does the name matter ?
p270_325.txt|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p270_326.txt|Survival is not an option.
p270_327.txt|There will be good prospects ahead.
p270_328.txt|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p270_329.txt|It is a court case.
p270_330.txt|This isn't the end of story.
p270_331.txt|It will set the tone.
p270_332.txt|He will go a long way.
p270_333.txt|It is far too early.
p270_334.txt|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p270_335.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p270_336.txt|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
p270_337.txt|The next week is crucial.
p270_338.txt|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p270_339.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p270_340.txt|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p270_341.txt|There was some merit in that.
p270_342.txt|They were impressive against France.
p270_343.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p270_344.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p270_345.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p270_346.txt|And does it ?
p270_347.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p270_348.txt|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p270_349.txt|Nobody said it was required.
p270_350.txt|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p270_351.txt|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p270_352.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p270_353.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p270_354.txt|There is a good example in this city.
p270_355.txt|It's wonderful to have won.
p270_356.txt|He was at school in Devon.
p270_357.txt|This decision is a farce.
p270_358.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p270_359.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p270_360.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p270_361.txt|We have very limited capacity.
p270_362.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p270_363.txt|An alternative must be offered.
p270_364.txt|The value of the merger is still there.
p270_365.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p270_366.txt|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p270_367.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p270_368.txt|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p270_369.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p270_370.txt|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p270_371.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p270_372.txt|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p270_373.txt|I came here this week to work.
p270_374.txt|They knew that I wanted to do something.
p270_375.txt|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p270_376.txt|He must have seen the movie.
p270_377.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p270_378.txt|She said they would appeal.
p270_379.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p270_380.txt|How are you, sir ?
p270_381.txt|So is that it, then ?
p270_382.txt|What do we do ?
p270_383.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p270_384.txt|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p270_385.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p270_386.txt|She is obviously very disappointed.
p270_387.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p270_388.txt|Last season was very hard for me.
p270_389.txt|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p270_390.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p270_391.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p270_392.txt|I always knew she was funny.

p270_403.txt|There's still no-one like him.
p270_404.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p270_405.txt|Ferguson must take the blame.
p270_406.txt|It's too close to call.
p270_407.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p270_408.txt|Of course, it is nonsense.
p270_409.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p270_410.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p270_411.txt|That is the ultimate revenge.
p270_412.txt|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p270_413.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p270_414.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p270_415.txt|Shelter also supports the reform.
p270_416.txt|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.

p270_419.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p270_420.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.

p270_422.txt|Such an attack is bizarre.
p270_423.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p270_424.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.

p270_426.txt|It needs to be volatile.
p270_427.txt|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.

p270_433.txt|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p270_434.txt|The British government does not want to know.
p270_435.txt|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.

p270_449.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p270_450.txt|Our legal advice is clear.
p270_451.txt|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.

p271_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p271_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p271_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p271_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p271_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p271_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p271_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p271_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p271_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p271_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p271_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p271_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p271_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p271_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p271_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p271_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p271_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p271_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p271_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p271_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p271_025.txt|She looked so young.
p271_026.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p271_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p271_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p271_029.txt|They have no history.
p271_030.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p271_031.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p271_032.txt|I'd just like to play.
p271_033.txt|This is the window.
p271_034.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p271_035.txt|We speak about the performance.
p271_036.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p271_037.txt|It was clear.
p271_038.txt|Indeed, he does.
p271_039.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p271_040.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p271_041.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p271_042.txt|We will push.
p271_043.txt|I hate the word.
p271_044.txt|They said she was stable.
p271_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p271_046.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p271_047.txt|There is no reason at all.
p271_048.txt|He is too weak to move.
p271_049.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p271_050.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p271_051.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p271_052.txt|Here's a clue.
p271_053.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p271_054.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p271_055.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p271_056.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p271_057.txt|I love the Dome.
p271_058.txt|It's so awful.
p271_059.txt|It is unique.
p271_060.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p271_061.txt|That's the truth.
p271_062.txt|Jobs could go.
p271_063.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p271_064.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p271_065.txt|It's that kind of place.
p271_066.txt|They are real.
p271_067.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p271_068.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p271_069.txt|We should have known.
p271_070.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p271_071.txt|Try to save us.
p271_072.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p271_073.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p271_074.txt|It's all I can do.
p271_075.txt|There could be a way back.
p271_076.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p271_077.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p271_078.txt|Neither it is.
p271_079.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p271_080.txt|The party is up for it.
p271_081.txt|Even the one she loved.
p271_082.txt|He is in the queue.
p271_083.txt|He is driven.
p271_084.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p271_085.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p271_086.txt|Someone who cares
p271_087.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p271_088.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p271_089.txt|They lived for their children.
p271_090.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p271_091.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p271_092.txt|It is a lifeline.
p271_093.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p271_094.txt|He was possessed
p271_095.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p271_096.txt|This one did.
p271_097.txt|Then came the crunch.
p271_098.txt|It is annoying.
p271_099.txt|It is home-grown.
p271_100.txt|They are now divorced.
p271_101.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p271_102.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p271_103.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p271_104.txt|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p271_105.txt|It is a love affair.
p271_106.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p271_107.txt|That would be unlawful.
p271_108.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p271_109.txt|He takes the job.
p271_110.txt|She reflects a bit.
p271_111.txt|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p271_112.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p271_113.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p271_114.txt|I am an actor.
p271_115.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p271_116.txt|It was the eighties.
p271_117.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p271_118.txt|It is so sad.
p271_119.txt|You had better believe it.
p271_120.txt|It's not fair.
p271_121.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p271_122.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p271_123.txt|Who would have?
p271_124.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p271_125.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p271_126.txt|The people will come.
p271_127.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p271_128.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p271_129.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p271_130.txt|We work well together.
p271_131.txt|What will happen then?
p271_132.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p271_133.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p271_134.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p271_135.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p271_136.txt|Is that it?
p271_137.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p271_138.txt|He should resign.
p271_139.txt|I was dead.
p271_140.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p271_141.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p271_142.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p271_143.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p271_144.txt|She died at her home.
p271_145.txt|He realises his mistake.
p271_146.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p271_147.txt|I was awful.
p271_148.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p271_149.txt|Note the date.
p271_150.txt|So I got a blood test.
p271_151.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p271_152.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p271_153.txt|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p271_154.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p271_155.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p271_156.txt|Work has started.
p271_157.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p271_158.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p271_159.txt|Words were not required.
p271_160.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p271_161.txt|That includes the equipment?
p271_162.txt|These days are long gone.
p271_163.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p271_164.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p271_165.txt|It has to be now.
p271_166.txt|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p271_167.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p271_168.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p271_169.txt|They are not advertised.
p271_170.txt|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p271_171.txt|Tell it like it was?
p271_172.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p271_173.txt|We have a budget in March.
p271_174.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p271_175.txt|You had to go and see him.
p271_176.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p271_177.txt|It is really good news.
p271_178.txt|He was a crazy man.
p271_179.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p271_180.txt|One season, they might do well.
p271_181.txt|As we worked.
p271_182.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p271_183.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p271_184.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p271_185.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p271_186.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p271_187.txt|The goals were good.
p271_188.txt|I've been there.
p271_189.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271_190.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p271_191.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p271_192.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p271_193.txt|One was a lawyer.
p271_194.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p271_195.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p271_196.txt|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p271_197.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p271_198.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p271_199.txt|It is a farce.
p271_200.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p271_201.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p271_202.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p271_203.txt|It opened last month.
p271_204.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p271_205.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p271_206.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p271_207.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p271_208.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p271_209.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p271_210.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p271_211.txt|I don't want to use it.
p271_212.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p271_213.txt|You have a plan?
p271_214.txt|It had all been arranged.
p271_215.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p271_216.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p271_217.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p271_218.txt|I might come back.
p271_219.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p271_220.txt|That idea is rubbish.
p271_221.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p271_222.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p271_223.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p271_224.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p271_225.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p271_226.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p271_227.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p271_228.txt|I will win.
p271_229.txt|I am immensely sad.
p271_230.txt|It's not before time.
p271_231.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p271_232.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p271_233.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p271_234.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p271_235.txt|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p271_236.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p271_237.txt|We were awful.
p271_238.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p271_239.txt|We are so proud.
p271_240.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271_241.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p271_242.txt|It's quite nice.
p271_243.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p271_244.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p271_245.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p271_246.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p271_247.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p271_248.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p271_249.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p271_250.txt|It is hard won.
p271_251.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p271_252.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p271_253.txt|The scene is about this?
p271_254.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p271_255.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p271_256.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p271_257.txt|The concerns are the same.
p271_258.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p271_259.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p271_260.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p271_261.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p271_262.txt|Is that a serious question?
p271_263.txt|This is the first step.
p271_264.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p271_265.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p271_266.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p271_267.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p271_268.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p271_269.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p271_270.txt|You take a risk.
p271_271.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p271_272.txt|He was also married with two children.
p271_273.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p271_274.txt|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p271_275.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p271_276.txt|That goes back a long way.
p271_277.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p271_278.txt|She failed in her action.
p271_279.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p271_280.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p271_281.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p271_282.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p271_283.txt|We are a grandmother.
p271_284.txt|He looked very sharp.
p271_285.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p271_286.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p271_287.txt|You feel very helpless.
p271_288.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p271_289.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p271_290.txt|It was a virus.
p271_291.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p271_292.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p271_293.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p271_294.txt|This is a national crisis.
p271_295.txt|We are not going to forget.
p271_296.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p271_297.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p271_298.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p271_299.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p271_300.txt|Nothing is safe.
p271_301.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p271_302.txt|There is no openness.
p271_303.txt|They are wrong.
p271_304.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p271_305.txt|This is a war over our home.
p271_306.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p271_307.txt|The court had a number of empty seats.
p271_308.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p271_309.txt|The plot is minimal.
p271_310.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p271_311.txt|There is no excuse.
p271_312.txt|The letters are going out today.
p271_313.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p271_314.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p271_315.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p271_316.txt|My whole life has changed.
p271_317.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p271_318.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p271_319.txt|Henman has been warned.
p271_320.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p271_321.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p271_322.txt|They had a confession.
p271_323.txt|We are in the end game.
p271_324.txt|It will work.
p271_325.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p271_326.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p271_327.txt|There was no time scale.
p271_328.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p271_329.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p271_330.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p271_331.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p271_332.txt|Is that an issue?
p271_333.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p271_334.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p271_335.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p271_336.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p271_337.txt|Who will do it?
p271_338.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p271_339.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p271_340.txt|I've got no secret.
p271_341.txt|This is a big advantage.
p271_342.txt|went on sale.
p271_343.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p271_344.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p271_345.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p271_346.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p271_347.txt|I got a yellow card.
p271_348.txt|We have big ideas.
p271_349.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p271_350.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p271_351.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p271_352.txt|Until they came to do it.
p271_353.txt|It is not like us.
p271_354.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p271_355.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p271_356.txt|We will be homeless.
p271_357.txt|That would help.
p271_358.txt|My husband was angry.
p271_359.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p271_360.txt|It is a memorial.
p271_361.txt|And he laughs.
p271_362.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p271_363.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p271_364.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p271_365.txt|Their time has gone.
p271_366.txt|It has only been rumours.
p271_367.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p271_368.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p271_369.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p271_370.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p271_371.txt|It seems a long time ago.
p271_372.txt|There is no signature.
p271_373.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p271_374.txt|It became a national network.
p271_375.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p271_376.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p271_377.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p271_378.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p271_379.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p271_380.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p271_381.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p271_382.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271_383.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p271_384.txt|It's a real problem.
p271_385.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p271_386.txt|Who will provide the wine?
p271_387.txt|It is unusual.
p271_388.txt|They deserved the win.
p271_389.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p271_390.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p271_391.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p271_392.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p271_393.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p271_394.txt|But we are a young side.
p271_395.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271_396.txt|It will take place in July.
p271_397.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p271_398.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p271_399.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p271_400.txt|It is full-scale.
p271_401.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p271_402.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p271_403.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p271_404.txt|They are not left wing.
p271_405.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p271_406.txt|In a way he was.
p271_407.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p271_408.txt|It might be.
p271_409.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p271_410.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p271_411.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p271_412.txt|He got his degree.
p271_413.txt|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p271_414.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p271_415.txt|But we finished the show.
p271_416.txt|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p271_417.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p271_418.txt|That may be.
p271_419.txt|It is legally binding.
p271_420.txt|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p271_421.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p271_422.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p271_423.txt|Paris is not only young.
p271_424.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271_425.txt|He is to appeal.
p271_426.txt|It was like someone had died.
p271_427.txt|I'm very grateful.
p271_428.txt|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271_429.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p271_430.txt|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p271_431.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p271_432.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p271_433.txt|Everything has collapsed.
p271_434.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p271_435.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p271_436.txt|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p271_437.txt|We are all equal.
p271_438.txt|Admission is free.
p271_439.txt|We are now up against it.
p271_440.txt|In it went.
p271_441.txt|We were used.
p271_442.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p271_443.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p271_444.txt|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p271_445.txt|They were not even allowed to see them.
p271_446.txt|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p271_447.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p271_448.txt|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271_449.txt|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p271_450.txt|Was it worth it?
p271_451.txt|It was ignored.
p271_452.txt|It is bizarre.
p271_453.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p271_454.txt|It's a miracle.
p272_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p272_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p272_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p272_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p272_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p272_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p272_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p272_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p272_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p272_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p272_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p272_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p272_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p272_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p272_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p272_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p272_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p272_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p272_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p272_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p272_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p272_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p272_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p272_025.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p272_026.txt|Is this accurate?
p272_027.txt|They have no history.
p272_028.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p272_029.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p272_030.txt|There's a story, too.
p272_031.txt|This is the window.
p272_032.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p272_033.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p272_034.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p272_035.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p272_036.txt|Was it worth it?
p272_037.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p272_038.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p272_039.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p272_040.txt|They're just different.
p272_041.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p272_042.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p272_043.txt|Indeed, he does.
p272_044.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p272_045.txt|He's just in it for himself.
p272_046.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p272_047.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p272_048.txt|We will push.
p272_049.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p272_050.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p272_051.txt|It is bizarre.
p272_052.txt|They said she was stable.
p272_053.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p272_054.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p272_055.txt|He is too weak to move.
p272_056.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p272_057.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p272_058.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p272_059.txt|Here's a clue.
p272_060.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p272_061.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p272_062.txt|There was no safety net.
p272_063.txt|It is unique.
p272_064.txt|That's the truth.
p272_065.txt|They are ready.
p272_066.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p272_067.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p272_068.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p272_069.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p272_070.txt|They are real.
p272_071.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p272_072.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p272_073.txt|He was popular.
p272_074.txt|But I've won both ways.
p272_075.txt|There was an e-mail.
p272_076.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p272_077.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p272_078.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p272_079.txt|I had my suspicions.
p272_080.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p272_081.txt|It was magic.
p272_082.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p272_083.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p272_084.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p272_085.txt|Even the one she loved.
p272_086.txt|Today she has been released.
p272_087.txt|He is in the queue.
p272_088.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p272_089.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p272_090.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p272_091.txt|Someone who cares
p272_092.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p272_093.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p272_094.txt|It is a blow.
p272_095.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p272_096.txt|They lived for their children.
p272_097.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p272_098.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p272_099.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p272_100.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p272_101.txt|It was clear.
p272_102.txt|It is annoying.
p272_103.txt|But I was wrong.
p272_104.txt|I love the Dome.
p272_105.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p272_106.txt|Our position remains unchanged.
p272_107.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p272_108.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p272_109.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p272_110.txt|You should be.
p272_111.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p272_112.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p272_113.txt|He takes the job.
p272_114.txt|She reflects a bit.
p272_115.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p272_116.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p272_117.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p272_118.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p272_119.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p272_120.txt|It is so sad.
p272_121.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p272_122.txt|It is rubbish.
p272_123.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p272_124.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p272_125.txt|Who would have?
p272_126.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p272_127.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p272_128.txt|I'm so angry.
p272_129.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p272_130.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p272_131.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p272_132.txt|No production was achieved.
p272_133.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p272_134.txt|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p272_135.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p272_136.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p272_137.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p272_138.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p272_139.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p272_140.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p272_141.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p272_142.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p272_143.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p272_144.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p272_145.txt|Who would be right?
p272_146.txt|She died at her home.
p272_147.txt|He realises his mistake.
p272_148.txt|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p272_149.txt|It is not just about pay.
p272_150.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p272_151.txt|So I got a blood test.
p272_152.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p272_153.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p272_154.txt|I was so nervous.
p272_155.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p272_156.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p272_157.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p272_158.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p272_159.txt|They should come clean.
p272_160.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p272_161.txt|He can do no wrong.
p272_162.txt|Well, he should know.
p272_163.txt|It is so unfair.
p272_164.txt|I will tell you.
p272_165.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p272_166.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p272_167.txt|It is not like us.
p272_168.txt|We've all had the shots.
p272_169.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p272_170.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p272_171.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p272_172.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p272_173.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p272_174.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p272_175.txt|As we worked.
p272_176.txt|Tony had arrived.
p272_177.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p272_178.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p272_179.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p272_180.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p272_181.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p272_182.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p272_183.txt|Our team is just so young.
p272_184.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p272_185.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p272_186.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p272_187.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p272_188.txt|Peace was won.
p272_189.txt|It's a fact.
p272_190.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p272_191.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p272_192.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p272_193.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p272_194.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p272_195.txt|But she might be.
p272_196.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p272_197.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p272_198.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p272_199.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p272_200.txt|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p272_201.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p272_202.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p272_203.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p272_204.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p272_205.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p272_206.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p272_207.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p272_208.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p272_209.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p272_210.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p272_211.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p272_212.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p272_213.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p272_214.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p272_215.txt|It's not before time.
p272_216.txt|The report is due out next month.
p272_217.txt|But she was.
p272_218.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p272_219.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p272_220.txt|They must do it.
p272_221.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p272_222.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p272_223.txt|Until they came to do it.
p272_224.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p272_225.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p272_226.txt|There is no excuse.
p272_227.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p272_228.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p272_229.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p272_230.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p272_231.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p272_232.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p272_233.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p272_234.txt|It is hard won.
p272_235.txt|Our policy is clear.
p272_236.txt|The scene is about this?
p272_237.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p272_238.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p272_239.txt|I should think so, too.
p272_240.txt|There's the mix.
p272_241.txt|The concerns are the same.
p272_242.txt|I can't get a job.
p272_243.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p272_244.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p272_245.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p272_246.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p272_247.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p272_248.txt|Is that a serious question?
p272_249.txt|This is the first step.
p272_250.txt|They must play for each other.
p272_251.txt|Souter will be back.
p272_252.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p272_253.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p272_254.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p272_255.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p272_256.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p272_257.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p272_258.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p272_259.txt|It's very nice.
p272_260.txt|He was also married with two children.
p272_261.txt|The system can work.
p272_262.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p272_263.txt|We're in shock.
p272_264.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p272_265.txt|It's a way of life.
p272_266.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p272_267.txt|It was very fast.
p272_268.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p272_269.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p272_270.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p272_271.txt|If not, he should go home.
p272_272.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p272_273.txt|He looked very sharp.
p272_274.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p272_275.txt|All options are open.
p272_276.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p272_277.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p272_278.txt|It was a virus.
p272_279.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p272_280.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p272_281.txt|This is a national crisis.
p272_282.txt|It was good.
p272_283.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p272_284.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p272_285.txt|The songs are just so good.
p272_286.txt|The goals will come.
p272_287.txt|There's a pause.
p272_288.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p272_289.txt|I was the sheep.
p272_290.txt|What has altered?
p272_291.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p272_292.txt|Nothing is safe.
p272_293.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p272_294.txt|One was a lawyer.
p272_295.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p272_296.txt|They are wrong.
p272_297.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p272_298.txt|The plot is minimal.
p272_299.txt|You are the glory.
p272_300.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p272_301.txt|The letters are going out today.
p272_302.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p272_303.txt|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p272_304.txt|My whole life has changed.
p272_305.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p272_306.txt|You may have a short memory.
p272_307.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p272_308.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p272_309.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p272_310.txt|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p272_311.txt|A review is under way.
p272_312.txt|It will work.
p272_313.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p272_314.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p272_315.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p272_316.txt|Off with their heads.
p272_317.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p272_318.txt|I was invited to work in Germany.
p272_319.txt|Is that an issue?
p272_320.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p272_321.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p272_322.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p272_323.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p272_324.txt|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p272_325.txt|Well, it won't.
p272_326.txt|These days are long gone.
p272_327.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p272_328.txt|I've got no secret.
p272_329.txt|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p272_330.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p272_331.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p272_332.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p272_333.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p272_334.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p272_335.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p272_336.txt|The performance was excellent.
p272_337.txt|That has been lost.
p272_338.txt|Tell us about it.
p272_339.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p272_340.txt|She said they would appeal.
p272_341.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p272_342.txt|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p272_343.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p272_344.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p272_345.txt|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p272_346.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p272_347.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p272_348.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p272_349.txt|We will be homeless.
p272_350.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p272_351.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p272_352.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p272_353.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p272_354.txt|Not so, it seems.
p272_355.txt|He could make it.
p272_356.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p272_357.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p272_358.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p272_359.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p272_360.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p272_361.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p272_362.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p272_363.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p272_364.txt|So there, we won.
p272_365.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p272_366.txt|There is no signature.
p272_367.txt|It was a funny game.
p272_368.txt|He was the architect.
p272_369.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p272_370.txt|I've never seen a game like it.
p272_371.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p272_372.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p272_373.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p272_374.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p272_375.txt|Something is wrong.
p272_376.txt|You can cope with it.
p272_377.txt|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p272_378.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p272_379.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p272_380.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p272_381.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p272_382.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p272_383.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p272_384.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p272_385.txt|It's a real problem.
p272_386.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p272_387.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p272_388.txt|It is unusual.
p272_389.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p272_390.txt|It's like a basketball.
p272_391.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p272_392.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p272_393.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p272_394.txt|It was a kind of contempt.
p272_395.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p272_396.txt|The car was just there.
p272_397.txt|It will take place in July.
p272_398.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p272_399.txt|Is that possible?
p272_400.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p272_401.txt|What was the difference between them?
p272_402.txt|Emotions were complex.
p272_403.txt|Then , he laughs.
p272_404.txt|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p272_405.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p272_406.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p272_407.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p272_408.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p272_409.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p272_410.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p272_411.txt|He got his degree.
p272_412.txt|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p273_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p273_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p273_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p273_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p273_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p273_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p273_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p273_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p273_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p273_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p273_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p273_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p273_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p273_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p273_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p273_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p273_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p273_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p273_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p273_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p273_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p273_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p273_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p273_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p273_026.txt|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p273_027.txt|Because we do not need it.
p273_028.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p273_029.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p273_030.txt|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p273_031.txt|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p273_032.txt|It carries a double message.
p273_033.txt|That is the face of fear.
p273_034.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p273_035.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p273_036.txt|This will save interest charges.
p273_037.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p273_038.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p273_039.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p273_040.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p273_041.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p273_042.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p273_043.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p273_044.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p273_045.txt|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p273_046.txt|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p273_047.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p273_048.txt|I must take a seat.
p273_049.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p273_050.txt|How are you, sir ?
p273_051.txt|So is that it, then ?
p273_052.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p273_053.txt|What do we do ?
p273_054.txt|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p273_055.txt|Let's hope that it does.
p273_056.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p273_057.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p273_058.txt|We will pay their bills.
p273_059.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p273_060.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p273_061.txt|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p273_062.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p273_063.txt|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p273_064.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p273_065.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p273_066.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p273_067.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p273_068.txt|The creditors have lost a lot.
p273_069.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p273_070.txt|Even the one she loved.
p273_071.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p273_072.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p273_073.txt|It makes for an interesting conference.
p273_074.txt|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
p273_075.txt|No progress has been made.
p273_076.txt|He has been a success this year.
p273_077.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p273_078.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p273_079.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p273_080.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p273_081.txt|They lived for their children.
p273_082.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p273_083.txt|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p273_084.txt|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p273_085.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p273_086.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p273_087.txt|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p273_088.txt|It was clear on Thursday.
p273_089.txt|It was a family tragedy.
p273_090.txt|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p273_091.txt|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p273_092.txt|He was prepared for this.
p273_093.txt|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p273_094.txt|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p273_095.txt|We intend to change the model.
p273_096.txt|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p273_097.txt|But the battle has only just begun.
p273_098.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p273_099.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p273_100.txt|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p273_101.txt|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p273_102.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p273_103.txt|We deserve a significant rise.
p273_104.txt|Got to win today, though.
p273_105.txt|The pressure is on them.
p273_106.txt|New Year will be very busy.
p273_107.txt|There's still plenty of time left.
p273_108.txt|I didn't think so either.
p273_109.txt|He thought she was amazing.
p273_110.txt|I came here this week to work.
p273_111.txt|Then again, we could have.
p273_112.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p273_113.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p273_114.txt|We would make a start.
p273_115.txt|His job was not advertised.
p273_116.txt|This is a frightening development.
p273_117.txt|Which can happen any time.
p273_118.txt|That is far too high.
p273_119.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p273_120.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p273_121.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p273_122.txt|You are a gambling man.
p273_123.txt|It feels like a privilege.
p273_124.txt|That is the ultimate revenge.
p273_125.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p273_126.txt|We'll have to think about it.
p273_127.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p273_128.txt|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
p273_129.txt|I'm so grateful for that.
p273_130.txt|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p273_131.txt|There's always the next century.
p273_132.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p273_133.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p273_134.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p273_135.txt|Behind him was his brother.
p273_136.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p273_137.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p273_138.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p273_139.txt|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p273_140.txt|Today is not a victory.
p273_141.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p273_142.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p273_143.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p273_144.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p273_145.txt|And does it ?
p273_146.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p273_147.txt|Had I heard ?
p273_148.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p273_149.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p273_150.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p273_151.txt|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p273_152.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p273_153.txt|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273_154.txt|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p273_155.txt|They could not match it.
p273_156.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p273_157.txt|His team management was protective.
p273_158.txt|One season, they might do well.
p273_159.txt|The jury is still out.
p273_160.txt|Phase one was a shambles.
p273_161.txt|I did not have a bet on myself.
p273_162.txt|It is also very valuable.
p273_163.txt|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p273_164.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p273_165.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p273_166.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p273_167.txt|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p273_168.txt|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p273_169.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p273_170.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p273_171.txt|It shows the strength of the roots.
p273_172.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p273_173.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p273_174.txt|Two years later, she was dead.
p273_175.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p273_176.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p273_177.txt|Everyone can have their opinion.
p273_178.txt|Because he was born in England.
p273_179.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p273_180.txt|What happened in that game ?
p273_181.txt|Are you going to win ?
p273_182.txt|Was it the wife ?
p273_183.txt|Why change it ?
p273_184.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p273_185.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p273_186.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p273_187.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p273_188.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p273_189.txt|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p273_190.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p273_191.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p273_192.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p273_193.txt|It gave no further details.
p273_194.txt|Little is known about them.
p273_195.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p273_196.txt|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p273_197.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p273_198.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p273_199.txt|His injury was completely random.
p273_200.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p273_201.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p273_202.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p273_203.txt|It had all been arranged.
p273_204.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p273_205.txt|His third goal was superb.
p273_206.txt|It will affect their work.
p273_207.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p273_208.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p273_209.txt|There's a chance they might come down.
p273_210.txt|The transaction is not feasible.
p273_211.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p273_212.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p273_213.txt|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p273_214.txt|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p273_216.txt|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p273_217.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p273_218.txt|You could feel the heat.
p273_219.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p273_220.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p273_221.txt|That was a problem for me.
p273_222.txt|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p273_223.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p273_224.txt|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p273_225.txt|He is obviously very dangerous.
p273_226.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p273_227.txt|It had so much to do with the output.
p273_228.txt|We have not been approached.
p273_229.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p273_230.txt|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p273_231.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p273_232.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p273_233.txt|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p273_234.txt|The irony was not lost.
p273_235.txt|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
p273_236.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p273_237.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p273_238.txt|We were well worth the win.
p273_239.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p273_240.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p273_241.txt|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p273_242.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p273_243.txt|Does the name matter ?

p273_295.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p273_296.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p273_297.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p273_298.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p273_299.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p273_300.txt|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p273_301.txt|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p273_302.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p273_303.txt|His appeal is instantly understood.
p273_304.txt|The songs are just so good.
p273_305.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p273_306.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.

p273_320.txt|He will go a long way.
p273_321.txt|We will listen to any suggestion.
p273_322.txt|But it is a slow process.
p273_323.txt|The woman is basically off her head.

p273_342.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p273_343.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p273_344.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p273_345.txt|There was a definite prejudice.

p273_358.txt|How independent is that ?
p273_359.txt|Are they free ?
p273_360.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p273_361.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p273_362.txt|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p273_363.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p273_364.txt|They have broken that promise.
p273_365.txt|That is a crazy situation.
p273_366.txt|We are really good friends.
p273_367.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.

p273_373.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p273_374.txt|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p273_375.txt|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p273_376.txt|It was like a weekly wage.
p273_377.txt|In due course the deal was done.
p273_378.txt|to have products for their needs.
p273_379.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p273_380.txt|We will win the argument.

p273_389.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p273_390.txt|Rugby is a hard game.
p273_391.txt|Is it worth it ?
p273_392.txt|Does it matter ?
p273_393.txt|How do you take them away ?
p273_394.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p273_395.txt|After the match, do you ?
p273_396.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p273_397.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p273_398.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p273_399.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p273_400.txt|The results will take second place.
p273_401.txt|It was a funny game.
p273_402.txt|It's too close to call.
p273_403.txt|It is a large number.
p273_404.txt|She started to put on weight.
p273_405.txt|I've had a wonderful career.
p273_406.txt|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p273_407.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p273_408.txt|There was an element of frustration.
p273_409.txt|Russell is delighted with them.
p273_410.txt|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p273_411.txt|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p273_412.txt|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.

p273_414.txt|I would like to continue to develop.
p273_415.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p273_416.txt|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p273_417.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p273_418.txt|That might mean another delay.
p273_419.txt|That's been all around Europe with me.
p273_420.txt|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
p273_421.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p273_422.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p273_423.txt|That means that nobody can do it.
p273_424.txt|Such an attack is bizarre.
p273_425.txt|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p273_426.txt|No date has been fixed for his return.
p273_427.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p273_428.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p273_429.txt|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p273_430.txt|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p273_431.txt|They are not left wing.
p273_432.txt|It is not a standing army.
p273_433.txt|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p273_434.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p273_435.txt|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p273_436.txt|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p275_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p275_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p275_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p275_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p275_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p275_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p275_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p275_009.txt|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p275_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p275_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p275_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p275_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p275_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p275_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p275_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p275_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p275_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p275_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p275_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p275_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p275_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p275_025.txt|But it failed.
p275_026.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p275_027.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p275_028.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p275_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p275_030.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p275_031.txt|There's a story, too.
p275_032.txt|He was jailed for four years.
p275_033.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p275_034.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p275_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p275_036.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p275_037.txt|They're just different.
p275_038.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p275_039.txt|Indeed, he does.
p275_040.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p275_041.txt|Dancing was her life.
p275_042.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p275_043.txt|We will push.
p275_044.txt|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p275_045.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p275_046.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p275_047.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p275_048.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p275_049.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p275_050.txt|Here's a clue.
p275_051.txt|I had come back from London.
p275_052.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p275_053.txt|It is unique.
p275_054.txt|That's the truth.
p275_055.txt|There's a danger.
p275_056.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p275_057.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p275_058.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p275_059.txt|This is the first step.
p275_060.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p275_061.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p275_062.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p275_063.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p275_064.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p275_065.txt|Try to save us.
p275_066.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p275_067.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p275_068.txt|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p275_069.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p275_070.txt|It's all I can do.
p275_071.txt|There could be a way back.
p275_072.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p275_073.txt|It works for us.
p275_074.txt|The party is up for it.
p275_075.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p275_076.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p275_077.txt|I will miss him.
p275_078.txt|A review is under way.
p275_079.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p275_080.txt|He is driven.
p275_081.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p275_082.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p275_083.txt|They lived for their children.
p275_084.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p275_085.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p275_086.txt|It is a lifeline.
p275_087.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p275_088.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p275_089.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p275_090.txt|But I was wrong.
p275_091.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p275_092.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p275_093.txt|Hartley should know.
p275_094.txt|It is a love affair.
p275_095.txt|May not have been at fault?
p275_096.txt|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p275_097.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p275_098.txt|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p275_099.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p275_100.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p275_101.txt|He takes the job.
p275_102.txt|She reflects a bit.
p275_103.txt|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p275_104.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p275_105.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p275_106.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p275_108.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p275_109.txt|It's a shame.
p275_110.txt|It was the eighties.
p275_111.txt|It is a financial matter.
p275_112.txt|It is so sad.
p275_113.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p275_114.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p275_115.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p275_116.txt|It's not fair.
p275_117.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p275_118.txt|It is rubbish.
p275_119.txt|Who would be a referee?
p275_120.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p275_121.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p275_122.txt|Who would have?
p275_123.txt|That's all right then.
p275_124.txt|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275_125.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p275_126.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p275_127.txt|It is not a U-turn.
p275_128.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p275_129.txt|Who will attend?
p275_130.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p275_131.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p275_132.txt|I am now unemployed.
p275_133.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p275_134.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p275_135.txt|What will happen then?
p275_136.txt|It's not true.
p275_137.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p275_138.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p275_139.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p275_140.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p275_141.txt|Is that it?
p275_142.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p275_143.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p275_144.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p275_145.txt|Who would be right?
p275_146.txt|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p275_147.txt|He realises his mistake.
p275_148.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p275_149.txt|I was awful.
p275_150.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p275_151.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p275_152.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p275_153.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p275_154.txt|So I got a blood test.
p275_155.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p275_156.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p275_157.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p275_158.txt|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p275_159.txt|They have not been named.
p275_160.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p275_161.txt|It was by the numbers.
p275_162.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p275_163.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p275_164.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p275_165.txt|Well, he should know.
p275_166.txt|Was this element always there?
p275_167.txt|These days are long gone.
p275_168.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p275_169.txt|We've all had the shots.
p275_170.txt|Tell it like it was?
p275_171.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p275_172.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p275_173.txt|You had to go and see him.
p275_174.txt|In a way he was.
p275_175.txt|One season, they might do well.
p275_176.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p275_177.txt|As we worked.
p275_178.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p275_179.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p275_180.txt|He deserved the win.
p275_181.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p275_182.txt|Tony had arrived.
p275_183.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p275_184.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p275_185.txt|His name was unknown.
p275_186.txt|It's an idea.
p275_187.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p275_188.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p275_189.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p275_190.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p275_191.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p275_192.txt|It is a farce.
p275_193.txt|Peace was won.
p275_194.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p275_195.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p275_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p275_197.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p275_198.txt|I have a cold.
p275_199.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p275_200.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p275_201.txt|Who will pay for this?
p275_203.txt|But she might be.
p275_205.txt|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
p275_207.txt|I don't want to use it.
p275_208.txt|Feel the heat?
p275_209.txt|He knows a lot.
p275_210.txt|You have a plan?
p275_211.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p275_212.txt|It had all been arranged.
p275_213.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p275_214.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p275_215.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p275_216.txt|Work has started.
p275_217.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p275_218.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p275_219.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p275_220.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p275_221.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p275_222.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p275_223.txt|Saturday is gone.
p275_224.txt|It's the Tate.
p275_225.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p275_226.txt|I will win.
p275_227.txt|The report is due out next month.
p275_228.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p275_229.txt|He is in the queue.
p275_230.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p275_231.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p275_233.txt|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p275_234.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p275_235.txt|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p275_236.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p275_237.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p275_238.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p275_239.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p275_240.txt|It is hard won.
p275_241.txt|Our policy is clear.
p275_242.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p275_243.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p275_244.txt|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p275_246.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p275_247.txt|It was a hit.
p275_248.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275_249.txt|I can't get a job.
p275_250.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p275_251.txt|Kirkwood was arrested.
p275_252.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p275_253.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p275_254.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p275_255.txt|Is that a serious question?
p275_256.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p275_257.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p275_258.txt|Souter will be back.
p275_259.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p275_260.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p275_261.txt|It will be done in stages.
p275_262.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p275_263.txt|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p275_264.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p275_265.txt|It's very nice.
p275_266.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p275_268.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p275_269.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p275_270.txt|It was very fast.
p275_271.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p275_272.txt|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p275_273.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p275_274.txt|It's so awful.
p275_275.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p275_276.txt|We are a grandmother.
p275_277.txt|He looked very sharp.
p275_278.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p275_279.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p275_280.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p275_281.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p275_282.txt|It was a virus.
p275_283.txt|Yet, it worked.
p275_284.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p275_285.txt|It was good.
p275_286.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p275_287.txt|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p275_288.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p275_289.txt|We are not going to forget.
p275_290.txt|I could never be cool.
p275_291.txt|Who can predict?
p275_292.txt|There was a vacuum.
p275_293.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p275_294.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275_295.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p275_296.txt|She is really magic.
p275_297.txt|One was a lawyer.
p275_298.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p275_299.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p275_300.txt|It could work.
p275_301.txt|This is a war over our home.
p275_302.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p275_303.txt|The court had a number of empty seats.
p275_304.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p275_305.txt|The plot is minimal.
p275_306.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p275_307.txt|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p275_308.txt|You should be.
p275_309.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p275_310.txt|The letters are going out today.
p275_311.txt|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p275_312.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p275_313.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p275_314.txt|We have got to get the points from this one.
p275_315.txt|My whole life has changed.
p275_316.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p275_317.txt|Kids are terrible.
p275_320.txt|We are in the end game.
p275_321.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p275_322.txt|Off with their heads.
p275_323.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p275_324.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p275_325.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p275_326.txt|Is that an issue?
p275_327.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p275_328.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p275_329.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p275_330.txt|It's been hard.
p275_331.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p275_332.txt|Who will do it?
p275_333.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p275_334.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p275_335.txt|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
p275_336.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p275_337.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p275_338.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p275_339.txt|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
p275_340.txt|This is a friendly match?
p275_341.txt|I got a yellow card.
p275_342.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p275_343.txt|Tell us about it.
p275_344.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p275_345.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p275_346.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p275_347.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p275_348.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p275_349.txt|She is free.
p275_350.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p275_351.txt|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p275_352.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p275_353.txt|It is not like us.
p275_354.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p275_355.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p275_356.txt|We will be homeless.
p275_357.txt|That would help.
p275_358.txt|It is a memorial.
p275_359.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p275_360.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p275_361.txt|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p275_362.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p275_363.txt|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
p275_364.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p275_365.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p275_366.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p275_367.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p275_368.txt|There is no signature.
p275_369.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p275_370.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p275_371.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p275_372.txt|It is hard to understand.
p275_373.txt|Something is wrong.
p275_374.txt|You can cope with it.
p275_375.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p275_376.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p275_377.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p275_378.txt|It is the old story.
p275_379.txt|It looked like a river.
p275_380.txt|It's a real problem.
p275_381.txt|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p275_382.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p275_383.txt|It's like a basketball.
p275_384.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p275_385.txt|It can help.
p275_386.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p275_387.txt|They are good.
p275_388.txt|I'm glad I came.
p275_389.txt|But we are a young side.
p275_390.txt|That set the tone.
p275_391.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p275_392.txt|What happened in the summer?
p275_393.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p275_394.txt|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p275_395.txt|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p275_396.txt|What was the difference between them?
p275_397.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p275_398.txt|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p275_399.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p275_400.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p275_402.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p275_403.txt|It might be.
p275_404.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p275_405.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p275_406.txt|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p275_407.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p275_408.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p275_409.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p275_410.txt|We went straight into the bedroom.
p275_411.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p275_413.txt|I am extremely cautious.
p275_414.txt|Paris is not only young.
p275_415.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p275_416.txt|He is to appeal.
p275_417.txt|It all began as an accident.
p275_418.txt|We have to expand.
p275_419.txt|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p275_420.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p275_421.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p275_422.txt|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p275_423.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p275_424.txt|We are now up against it.
p275_425.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p275_426.txt|I want a career.
p275_427.txt|He deserved a red card.
p275_428.txt|And they replied.
p275_429.txt|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p276_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p276_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p276_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p276_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p276_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p276_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p276_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p276_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p276_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p276_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p276_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p276_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p276_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p276_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p276_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p276_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p276_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p276_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p276_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p276_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p276_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p276_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p276_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p276_025.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p276_026.txt|How are you, sir ?
p276_027.txt|So is that it, then ?
p276_028.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p276_029.txt|What do we do ?
p276_030.txt|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p276_031.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p276_032.txt|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p276_033.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p276_034.txt|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276_035.txt|There was a rush of water.
p276_036.txt|A fiver and I'll tell.
p276_037.txt|We speak about the performance.
p276_038.txt|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p276_039.txt|Further management changes are planned.
p276_040.txt|I can feel the sound inside.
p276_041.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p276_042.txt|He is married with three children.
p276_043.txt|I might well have done so already.
p276_044.txt|This is slightly negative for inflation.
p276_045.txt|And they had a case.
p276_046.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p276_047.txt|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276_048.txt|It carried a double message.
p276_049.txt|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p276_050.txt|But not a penny has been paid.
p276_051.txt|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p276_052.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p276_053.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p276_054.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276_055.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p276_056.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p276_057.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p276_058.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p276_059.txt|He is too weak to move.
p276_060.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p276_061.txt|They desperately want some stability.
p276_062.txt|Everything is possible in football.
p276_063.txt|We like being the underdogs.
p276_064.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p276_065.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p276_066.txt|He will need that machine.
p276_067.txt|Then they scored two goals to win.
p276_068.txt|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p276_069.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p276_070.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p276_071.txt|Let's not be too despondent.
p276_072.txt|There was no safety net.
p276_073.txt|The Government does not go far enough.
p276_074.txt|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p276_075.txt|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p276_076.txt|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p276_077.txt|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p276_078.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p276_079.txt|I have made that offer.
p276_080.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p276_081.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p276_082.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p276_083.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p276_084.txt|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276_085.txt|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p276_086.txt|But the organisers refused to worry.
p276_087.txt|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
p276_088.txt|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p276_089.txt|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p276_090.txt|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p276_091.txt|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p276_092.txt|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276_093.txt|Funding needs to be long term.
p276_094.txt|We should all be grateful.
p276_095.txt|He's not getting into any games.
p276_096.txt|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p276_097.txt|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p276_098.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p276_099.txt|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276_100.txt|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p276_101.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p276_102.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p276_103.txt|It wasn't possible to relax.
p276_104.txt|Context is also very important.
p276_105.txt|There could be a way back.
p276_106.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p276_107.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p276_108.txt|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p276_109.txt|Even the one she loved.
p276_110.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276_111.txt|He's been active in Arabia.
p276_112.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p276_113.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p276_114.txt|It is sometimes like that.
p276_115.txt|He was unprepared for this fight.
p276_116.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p276_117.txt|Those people must be accountable.
p276_118.txt|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p276_119.txt|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p276_120.txt|Choice is a good thing.
p276_121.txt|I am not very pleased.
p276_122.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p276_123.txt|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p276_124.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p276_125.txt|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p276_126.txt|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p276_127.txt|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p276_128.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276_129.txt|They lived for their children.
p276_130.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p276_131.txt|Diversions were put in place.
p276_132.txt|The Queen Mother is dead.
p276_133.txt|No one person or small group could be singled out.

p276_150.txt|Are you going to win ?
p276_151.txt|Was it the wife ?
p276_152.txt|Why change it ?
p276_153.txt|And they all have a vote.
p276_154.txt|But they must believe in themselves.
p276_155.txt|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p276_156.txt|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.

p276_162.txt|A good actor doesn't think.
p276_163.txt|That's what happened against Ayr.
p276_164.txt|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p276_165.txt|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p276_166.txt|It is a good lifestyle.

p276_176.txt|It took five months to repair the damage.
p276_177.txt|They exist in name alone.
p276_178.txt|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p276_179.txt|You had better believe it.
p276_180.txt|It was a sobering experience.
p276_181.txt|I can see it now.
p276_182.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p276_183.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p276_184.txt|I've no idea how it works.

p276_187.txt|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p276_188.txt|She is in good spirits.
p276_189.txt|The changes took effect from June.
p276_190.txt|As if that is an achievement.
p276_191.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p276_192.txt|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p276_193.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.

p276_196.txt|I did not concentrate on my performance.

p276_198.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p276_199.txt|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276_200.txt|However, the problem is the timing.
p276_201.txt|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p276_202.txt|That was just one night.
p276_203.txt|This is a frightening development.
p276_204.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276_205.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p276_206.txt|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p276_207.txt|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p276_208.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p276_209.txt|It is quite a thing to watch.
p276_210.txt|This should begin in October.
p276_211.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p276_212.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p276_213.txt|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p276_214.txt|We did what we had to do.
p276_215.txt|The squad is too small.
p276_216.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p276_217.txt|Does the name matter ?
p276_218.txt|how do you get it back ?
p276_219.txt|What are you not good at ?
p276_220.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p276_221.txt|You've got to be vigilant.

p276_225.txt|You are a gambling man.
p276_226.txt|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276_227.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p276_228.txt|I would not say that.
p276_229.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p276_230.txt|The refund is fully justified.
p276_231.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p276_232.txt|I never wanted a legal battle.
p276_233.txt|It would make a lot of sense.

p276_240.txt|Is it worth it ?
p276_241.txt|Does it matter ?
p276_242.txt|How do you take them away ?
p276_243.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p276_244.txt|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p276_245.txt|We were right to be afraid.
p276_247.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p276_248.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p276_249.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.

p276_251.txt|That view has not altered.
p276_252.txt|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p276_253.txt|For business, the benefits will be enormous.

p276_266.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p276_267.txt|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p276_268.txt|We will turn the corner.
p276_269.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p276_270.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p276_271.txt|And they were being paid ?
p276_272.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p276_273.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p276_274.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p276_275.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p276_276.txt|Did he trip ?
p276_277.txt|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p276_278.txt|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p276_279.txt|This is absolutely not true.
p276_280.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p276_281.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p276_282.txt|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
p276_283.txt|I've come here for the jersey.
p276_284.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p276_285.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.

p276_287.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p276_288.txt|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
p276_289.txt|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p276_290.txt|We have a budget in March.
p276_291.txt|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.

p276_293.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p276_294.txt|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p276_295.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p276_296.txt|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p276_297.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p276_298.txt|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p276_299.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p276_300.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p276_301.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p276_302.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p276_303.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p276_304.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p276_305.txt|A winter of discontent awaits.
p276_306.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p276_307.txt|I am astonished at attack.
p276_308.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p276_309.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p276_310.txt|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p276_311.txt|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p276_312.txt|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p276_313.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p276_314.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p276_315.txt|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p276_316.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p276_317.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p276_318.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p276_319.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p276_320.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p276_321.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p276_322.txt|I saw them last week.
p276_323.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p276_324.txt|Did it work ?
p276_325.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p276_326.txt|Is our children learning ?
p276_327.txt|How independent is that ?
p276_328.txt|What form did that take ?
p276_329.txt|Are they free ?
p276_330.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p276_331.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p276_332.txt|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p276_333.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p276_334.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p276_335.txt|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
p276_336.txt|MOVIE stars are public property.
p276_337.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p276_338.txt|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p276_339.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p276_340.txt|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p276_341.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p276_342.txt|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p276_343.txt|And we have the experience.
p276_344.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p276_345.txt|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
p276_346.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p276_347.txt|You just have to give yourself a chance.
p276_348.txt|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p276_349.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p276_350.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p276_351.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p276_352.txt|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
p276_353.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276_354.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p276_355.txt|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
p276_356.txt|There is no quick fix.
p276_357.txt|What are they for ?
p276_358.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p276_359.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p276_360.txt|So what happens next ?
p276_361.txt|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p276_362.txt|Walker plans to return indoors.
p276_363.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p276_364.txt|He worked there for six months.
p276_365.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p276_366.txt|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p276_367.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p276_368.txt|I had relied on him.
p276_369.txt|Truth is the child of time.
p276_370.txt|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
p276_372.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p276_373.txt|Brown has always protested his innocence.
p276_374.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p276_375.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p276_376.txt|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p276_377.txt|Instead, he missed the lot.
p276_378.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p276_379.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p276_380.txt|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.

p276_382.txt|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p276_383.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p276_384.txt|But the rally was short-lived.
p276_385.txt|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p276_386.txt|It must be tough to live with.
p276_387.txt|The statement contained no surprises.
p276_388.txt|Six other people were injured.
p276_389.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p276_390.txt|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p276_391.txt|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p276_392.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p276_393.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p276_394.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p276_395.txt|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p276_396.txt|He is obviously very dangerous.
p276_397.txt|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p276_398.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p276_399.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p276_400.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p276_401.txt|It had so much to do with output.
p276_402.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p276_403.txt|After the match, do you ?
p276_404.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p276_405.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p276_406.txt|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p276_407.txt|Its failure is no surprise.
p276_408.txt|It has to be enforced.
p276_409.txt|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p276_410.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p276_411.txt|You will have seen the adverts.
p276_412.txt|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p276_413.txt|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p276_414.txt|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p276_415.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p276_416.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p276_417.txt|Venus rejects the very suggestion.

p276_423.txt|You didn't need to pay.
p276_424.txt|The might be rolled out.
p276_425.txt|But nothing could be done.
p276_426.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p276_427.txt|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p276_428.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p276_429.txt|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p276_430.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p276_431.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p276_432.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p276_433.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p276_434.txt|The company declined to comment.
p276_435.txt|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p276_436.txt|They make the right decisions.
p276_437.txt|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p276_438.txt|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p276_439.txt|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
p276_440.txt|I got a yellow card.
p276_441.txt|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p276_442.txt|Not many people like to do that.
p276_443.txt|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
p276_444.txt|I might also completely change the routine.
p276_445.txt|We accept the new rules.
p276_446.txt|He was due to retire in December.
p276_447.txt|We go there with confidence.
p276_448.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p276_449.txt|He was released after treatment.
p276_450.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p276_451.txt|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
p276_452.txt|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p276_453.txt|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p276_454.txt|They must play for each other.
p276_455.txt|We are aiming for early March.
p276_456.txt|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p276_457.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.

p276_460.txt|We will pay their bills.
p276_461.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p276_462.txt|It was very positive and very helpful.
p276_463.txt|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p276_464.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p276_465.txt|We are having a look.
p277_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p277_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p277_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p277_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p277_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p277_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p277_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p277_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p277_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p277_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p277_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p277_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p277_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p277_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p277_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p277_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p277_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p277_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p277_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p277_025.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p277_026.txt|Is this accurate?
p277_027.txt|They have no history.
p277_028.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p277_029.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p277_030.txt|There's a story, too.
p277_031.txt|This is the window.
p277_032.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p277_033.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277_034.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277_035.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p277_036.txt|Was it worth it?
p277_037.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277_038.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277_039.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p277_040.txt|They're just different.
p277_041.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p277_042.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277_043.txt|Indeed, he does.
p277_044.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277_045.txt|He's just in it for himself.
p277_046.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p277_047.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277_048.txt|We will push.
p277_049.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p277_050.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p277_051.txt|It is bizarre.
p277_052.txt|They said she was stable.
p277_053.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p277_054.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p277_055.txt|He is too weak to move.
p277_056.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p277_057.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p277_058.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p277_059.txt|Here's a clue.
p277_060.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p277_061.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p277_062.txt|There was no safety net.
p277_063.txt|It is unique.
p277_064.txt|That's the truth.
p277_065.txt|They are ready.
p277_066.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p277_067.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p277_068.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277_069.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277_070.txt|They are real.
p277_071.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p277_072.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p277_073.txt|He was popular.
p277_074.txt|But I've won both ways.
p277_075.txt|There was an e-mail.
p277_076.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277_077.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277_078.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p277_079.txt|I had my suspicions.
p277_080.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p277_081.txt|It was magic.
p277_082.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p277_083.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p277_084.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277_085.txt|Even the one she loved.
p277_086.txt|Today she has been released.
p277_087.txt|He is in the queue.
p277_088.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277_089.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090.txt|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p277_091.txt|Someone who cares
p277_092.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p277_093.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p277_094.txt|It is a blow.
p277_095.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277_096.txt|They lived for their children.
p277_097.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p277_098.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p277_099.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277_100.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p277_101.txt|It was clear.
p277_102.txt|It is annoying.
p277_103.txt|But I was wrong.
p277_104.txt|I love the Dome.
p277_105.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p277_106.txt|Our position remains unchanged.
p277_107.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p277_108.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p277_109.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p277_110.txt|You should be.
p277_111.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p277_112.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p277_113.txt|He takes the job.
p277_114.txt|She reflects a bit.
p277_115.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p277_116.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p277_117.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p277_118.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p277_119.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p277_120.txt|It is so sad.
p277_121.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p277_122.txt|It is rubbish.
p277_123.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p277_124.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p277_125.txt|Who would have?
p277_126.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p277_127.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p277_128.txt|I'm so angry.
p277_129.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p277_130.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p277_131.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p277_132.txt|No production was achieved.
p277_133.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p277_134.txt|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p277_135.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p277_136.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p277_137.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p277_138.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p277_139.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p277_140.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p277_141.txt|I had decided to quit the show.
p277_142.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p277_143.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p277_144.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p277_145.txt|Who would be right?
p277_146.txt|She died at her home.
p277_147.txt|He realises his mistake.
p277_148.txt|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p277_149.txt|It is not just about pay.
p277_150.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p277_151.txt|So I got a blood test.
p277_152.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p277_153.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p277_154.txt|I was so nervous.
p277_155.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p277_156.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p277_157.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p277_158.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p277_159.txt|They should come clean.
p277_160.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p277_161.txt|He can do no wrong.
p277_162.txt|Well, he should know.
p277_163.txt|It is so unfair.
p277_164.txt|I will tell you.
p277_165.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p277_166.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p277_167.txt|It is not like us.
p277_168.txt|We've all had the shots.
p277_169.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p277_170.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p277_171.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p277_172.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p277_173.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p277_174.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p277_175.txt|As we worked.
p277_176.txt|Tony had arrived.
p277_177.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p277_178.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p277_179.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p277_180.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p277_181.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p277_182.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p277_183.txt|Our team is just so young.
p277_184.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p277_185.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p277_186.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p277_187.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p277_188.txt|Peace was won.
p277_189.txt|It's a fact.
p277_190.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p277_191.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p277_192.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p277_193.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p277_194.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p277_195.txt|But she might be.
p277_196.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p277_197.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p277_198.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p277_199.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p277_200.txt|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277_201.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277_202.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p277_203.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p277_204.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p277_205.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p277_206.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p277_207.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p277_208.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p277_209.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p277_210.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p277_211.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p277_212.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p277_213.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277_214.txt|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277_215.txt|It's not before time.
p277_216.txt|The report is due out next month.
p277_217.txt|But she was.
p277_218.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277_219.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p277_220.txt|They must do it.
p277_221.txt|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277_222.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p277_223.txt|Until they came to do it.
p277_224.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277_225.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p277_226.txt|There is no excuse.
p277_228.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p277_229.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p277_230.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277_231.txt|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277_232.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p277_233.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p277_234.txt|It is hard won.
p277_235.txt|Our policy is clear.
p277_236.txt|The scene is about this?
p277_237.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p277_238.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p277_239.txt|I should think so, too.
p277_240.txt|There's the mix.
p277_241.txt|The concerns are the same.
p277_242.txt|I can't get a job.
p277_243.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277_244.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277_245.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277_246.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277_248.txt|Is that a serious question?
p277_249.txt|This is the first step.
p277_250.txt|They must play for each other.
p277_251.txt|Souter will be back.
p277_252.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p277_253.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p277_254.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p277_255.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p277_256.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p277_257.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p277_258.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p277_259.txt|It's very nice.
p277_260.txt|He was also married with two children.
p277_261.txt|The system can work.
p277_262.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p277_263.txt|We're in shock.
p277_264.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277_265.txt|It's a way of life.
p277_266.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p277_267.txt|It was very fast.
p277_268.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p277_269.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277_270.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p277_271.txt|If not, he should go home.
p277_272.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277_273.txt|He looked very sharp.
p277_274.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277_275.txt|All options are open.
p277_276.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p277_277.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277_278.txt|It was a virus.
p277_279.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p277_280.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277_281.txt|This is a national crisis.
p277_282.txt|It was good.
p277_283.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p277_284.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285.txt|The songs are just so good.
p277_286.txt|The goals will come.
p277_287.txt|There's a pause.
p277_288.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277_289.txt|I was the sheep.
p277_290.txt|What has altered?
p277_291.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p277_292.txt|Nothing is safe.
p277_293.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p277_294.txt|One was a lawyer.
p277_295.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277_296.txt|They are wrong.
p277_297.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277_298.txt|The plot is minimal.
p277_299.txt|You are the glory.
p277_300.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p277_301.txt|The letters are going out today.
p277_302.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p277_303.txt|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p277_304.txt|My whole life has changed.
p277_305.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p277_306.txt|You may have a short memory.
p277_307.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277_308.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p277_309.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p277_310.txt|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277_311.txt|A review is under way.
p277_312.txt|It will work.
p277_313.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p277_314.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p277_315.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277_316.txt|Off with their heads.
p277_317.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p277_318.txt|I was invited to work in Germany.
p277_319.txt|Is that an issue?
p277_320.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277_321.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277_322.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p277_323.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277_324.txt|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277_325.txt|Well, it won't.
p277_326.txt|These days are long gone.
p277_327.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p277_328.txt|I've got no secret.
p277_329.txt|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277_330.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p277_331.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277_332.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p277_333.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277_334.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277_335.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p277_336.txt|The performance was excellent.
p277_337.txt|That has been lost.
p277_338.txt|Tell us about it.
p277_339.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277_340.txt|She said they would appeal.
p277_341.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p277_342.txt|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p277_343.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277_344.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p277_346.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p277_347.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277_348.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277_349.txt|We will be homeless.
p277_350.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p277_351.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277_352.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277_353.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p277_354.txt|Not so, it seems.
p277_355.txt|He could make it.
p277_356.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p277_357.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p277_358.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p277_359.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p277_360.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p277_361.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p277_362.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277_363.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277_364.txt|So there, we won.
p277_365.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p277_366.txt|There is no signature.
p277_367.txt|It was a funny game.
p277_368.txt|He was the architect.
p277_369.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277_370.txt|I've never seen a game like it.
p277_371.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p277_372.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277_373.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p277_374.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p277_375.txt|Something is wrong.
p277_376.txt|You can cope with it.
p277_377.txt|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p277_378.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p277_379.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p277_380.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277_381.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277_382.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p277_383.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p277_384.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p277_385.txt|It's a real problem.
p277_386.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p277_387.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p277_388.txt|It is unusual.
p277_389.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p277_390.txt|It's like a basketball.
p277_391.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p277_392.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277_393.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277_394.txt|It was a kind of contempt.
p277_395.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p277_396.txt|The car was just there.
p277_397.txt|It will take place in July.
p277_398.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p277_399.txt|Is that possible?
p277_400.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p277_401.txt|What was the difference between them?
p277_402.txt|Emotions were complex.
p277_403.txt|Then , he laughs.
p277_404.txt|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277_405.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p277_406.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p277_407.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p277_408.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p277_409.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p277_410.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p277_411.txt|He got his degree.
p277_412.txt|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277_413.txt|went on sale.
p277_414.txt|But we finished the show.
p277_415.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p277_416.txt|The people around me were fantastic.
p277_417.txt|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p277_418.txt|It is legally binding.
p277_419.txt|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_420.txt|There's been a mistake.
p277_421.txt|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p277_422.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p277_423.txt|I am extremely cautious.
p277_424.txt|It was little else.
p277_425.txt|It all began as an accident.
p277_426.txt|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
p277_427.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p277_428.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p277_429.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p277_430.txt|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p277_431.txt|We are all equal.
p277_432.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p277_433.txt|We were used.
p277_434.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p277_435.txt|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p277_436.txt|They were not even allowed to see them.
p277_437.txt|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p277_438.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p277_439.txt|It won the match.
p277_440.txt|And it showed.
p277_441.txt|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p277_442.txt|I hate the word.
p277_443.txt|Who would be in that desert?
p277_444.txt|I was lost.
p277_445.txt|The children are fine.
p277_446.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p277_447.txt|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p277_448.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p277_449.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p277_450.txt|It was a total disaster.
p277_451.txt|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p277_452.txt|I got a yellow card.
p277_453.txt|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p277_454.txt|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p277_455.txt|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p277_456.txt|If they don't, they should say so.
p277_457.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p277_458.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p277_459.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p277_460.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p277_461.txt|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p277_462.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p277_463.txt|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p278_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p278_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p278_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p278_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p278_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p278_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p278_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p278_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p278_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p278_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p278_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p278_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p278_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p278_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p278_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p278_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p278_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p278_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p278_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p278_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p278_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p278_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p278_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p278_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p278_026.txt|These decisions are not simple.
p278_027.txt|Life was like a timetable.

p278_030.txt|The director will be present.
p278_031.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p278_032.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p278_033.txt|It carried a double message.
p278_034.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p278_035.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p278_036.txt|Several investments have already been made.
p278_037.txt|It was a hell of a way to lose.
p278_038.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p278_039.txt|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p278_040.txt|This will get their attention.
p278_041.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p278_042.txt|Well, the climate has changed.
p278_043.txt|Must be prepared to use it.
p278_044.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p278_045.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p278_046.txt|How are you, sir ?
p278_047.txt|So is that it, then ?
p278_048.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p278_049.txt|He will need that machine.
p278_050.txt|I have learned from him.
p278_051.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p278_052.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p278_053.txt|People come to see the Highlands.
p278_054.txt|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p278_055.txt|We have not given up hope.
p278_056.txt|She said she was really sorry.
p278_057.txt|None has ever been found.
p278_058.txt|Let's hope that it does.
p278_059.txt|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
p278_060.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p278_061.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p278_062.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p278_063.txt|I'm looking to the future.
p278_064.txt|But it has been an amazing experience.
p278_065.txt|The judge was really nice.
p278_066.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p278_067.txt|The fans would love it.
p278_068.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p278_069.txt|The party is up for it.
p278_070.txt|Even the one she loved.
p278_071.txt|It was a unanimous decision.
p278_072.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p278_073.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p278_074.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p278_075.txt|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p278_076.txt|By then, he was walking on water.

p278_078.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p278_079.txt|Mr Smith declined to comment.

p278_083.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p278_084.txt|Everyone had to play the game.
p278_085.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p278_086.txt|It was clear on Thursday.
p278_087.txt|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p278_088.txt|But they must believe in themselves.
p278_089.txt|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p278_090.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p278_091.txt|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p278_092.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p278_093.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p278_094.txt|In the end we made too many errors.
p278_095.txt|That time is not now, however.
p278_096.txt|We created so many chances.
p278_097.txt|Our house was very small.
p278_098.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p278_099.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p278_100.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p278_101.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p278_102.txt|And does it ?
p278_103.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p278_104.txt|Had I heard ?
p278_105.txt|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p278_106.txt|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p278_107.txt|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p278_108.txt|We have got a race.
p278_109.txt|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p278_110.txt|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.

p278_112.txt|They almost achieved a draw.
p278_113.txt|Football is a passion for many.
p278_114.txt|I didn't think so either.
p278_115.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p278_116.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p278_117.txt|That might help a bit.
p278_118.txt|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p278_119.txt|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
p278_120.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p278_121.txt|The hearing was due to continue today.
p278_122.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p278_123.txt|However, the problem is the timing.
p278_124.txt|This is a frightening development.
p278_125.txt|Which can happen any time.
p278_126.txt|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278_127.txt|We had another last Tuesday.
p278_128.txt|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p278_129.txt|This should begin in October.
p278_130.txt|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p278_131.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p278_132.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p278_133.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p278_134.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p278_135.txt|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p278_136.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p278_137.txt|Before it was an ordeal.
p278_138.txt|It will affect their work.
p278_139.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p278_140.txt|They could use a boost.
p278_141.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p278_142.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p278_143.txt|Others are not so sure.
p278_144.txt|I have always loved the countryside.
p278_145.txt|It was his job to check.
p278_146.txt|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p278_147.txt|There's always the next century.
p278_148.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p278_149.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p278_150.txt|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p278_151.txt|Nothing was meant by it.
p278_152.txt|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p278_153.txt|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
p278_154.txt|It was by the numbers.
p278_155.txt|I knew he was good.
p278_156.txt|We will turn the corner.
p278_157.txt|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p278_158.txt|These days are long gone.
p278_159.txt|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p278_160.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p278_161.txt|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p278_162.txt|So was the first half.
p278_163.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p278_164.txt|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p278_165.txt|We have a budget in March.
p278_166.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p278_167.txt|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p278_168.txt|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p278_169.txt|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p278_170.txt|On my day I can beat anyone.
p278_171.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p278_172.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p278_173.txt|What happened in that game ?
p278_174.txt|Are you going to win ?
p278_175.txt|Was it the wife ?
p278_176.txt|Why change it ?
p278_177.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p278_178.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p278_179.txt|His team management was protective.
p278_180.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p278_181.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p278_182.txt|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p278_183.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p278_184.txt|It is vital to clarify their role.
p278_185.txt|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p278_186.txt|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p278_187.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p278_188.txt|That's not fair to the supporters.
p278_189.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p278_190.txt|I've always been like that.
p278_191.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p278_192.txt|They were seriously after him.
p278_193.txt|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p278_194.txt|It shows the strength of the roots.
p278_195.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p278_196.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p278_197.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p278_198.txt|I had come back from London.
p278_199.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p278_200.txt|They are still very quiet.
p278_201.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p278_202.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p278_203.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p278_204.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p278_205.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p278_206.txt|We could soon be in that same position!
p278_207.txt|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p278_208.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p278_209.txt|I am very realistic about these things.
p278_210.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p278_211.txt|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p278_212.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p278_213.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p278_214.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278_215.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p278_216.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p278_217.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p278_218.txt|They have known the hard times.
p278_219.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p278_220.txt|The only problem was the greens.
p278_221.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p278_222.txt|His injury was completely random.
p278_223.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p278_224.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p278_225.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p278_226.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p278_227.txt|Does the name matter ?
p278_228.txt|how do you get it back ?
p278_229.txt|What are you not good at ?
p278_230.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p278_231.txt|Who was she ?
p278_232.txt|It was finally agreed on Saturday.

p278_251.txt|There were no reports of casualties.
p278_252.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p278_253.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p278_254.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p278_255.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p278_256.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p278_257.txt|I was just getting over the time difference.
p278_258.txt|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.

p278_266.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p278_267.txt|Messages have to be reinforced.
p278_268.txt|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p278_269.txt|We accept the new rules.
p278_270.txt|And they were being paid ?
p278_271.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p278_272.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p278_273.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p278_274.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p278_275.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p278_276.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p278_277.txt|He was released after treatment.
p278_278.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p278_279.txt|I'd never run for them.
p278_280.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p278_281.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p278_282.txt|These figures are truly terrible.
p278_283.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p278_284.txt|The stage was set for a showdown.
p278_285.txt|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p278_286.txt|I'd like to report a murder.
p278_287.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p278_288.txt|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p278_289.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p278_290.txt|I understand the security issue.
p278_291.txt|Truth is the child of time.
p278_292.txt|It has become a way of life.
p278_293.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p278_294.txt|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p278_295.txt|It was never a free kick.

p278_297.txt|This is a great opportunity for us.
p278_298.txt|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p278_299.txt|You have to expect this type of thing.
p278_300.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.

p278_317.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p278_318.txt|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.

p278_321.txt|I first met him last summer.
p278_322.txt|The songs are just so good.

p278_329.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p278_330.txt|The party lasted all night.
p278_331.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p278_332.txt|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278_333.txt|They come to enjoy themselves.
p278_334.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p278_335.txt|And he goes with it.
p278_336.txt|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p278_337.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p278_338.txt|The letters are going out today.
p278_339.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p278_340.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p278_341.txt|How independent is that ?
p278_342.txt|What form did that take ?
p278_343.txt|What are they for ?
p278_344.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p278_345.txt|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
p278_346.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p278_347.txt|And he is immensely loyal.
p278_348.txt|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p278_349.txt|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p278_350.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p278_351.txt|And it was this one.
p278_352.txt|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p278_353.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p278_354.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p278_355.txt|He was at school in Devon.
p278_356.txt|Finally came the moment of truth.
p278_357.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p278_358.txt|A crucial moment has arrived.
p278_359.txt|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p278_360.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p278_361.txt|But we welcome this document.
p278_362.txt|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p278_363.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p278_364.txt|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p278_365.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p278_366.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p278_367.txt|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p278_368.txt|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p278_369.txt|I was delighted to accept.
p278_370.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p278_371.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p278_372.txt|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p278_373.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p278_374.txt|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p278_375.txt|He must have seen the movie.
p278_376.txt|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p278_377.txt|The major championships will always have a special place.
p278_378.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p278_379.txt|This decision is a farce.
p278_380.txt|Is it worth it ?
p278_381.txt|Does it matter ?
p278_382.txt|How do you take them away ?
p278_383.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p278_384.txt|After the match, do you ?
p278_385.txt|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p278_386.txt|In due course the deal was done.
p278_387.txt|This remains the party's policy.
p278_388.txt|They will fight for everything.
p278_389.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p278_390.txt|The team hadn't been picked.
p278_391.txt|One-third of the places are already taken.
p278_392.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p278_393.txt|The marshall at the turn was great.
p278_394.txt|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p278_395.txt|They have not got anyone.
p278_396.txt|The law would appear to be on our side.
p278_397.txt|It has happened for generations.
p278_398.txt|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p278_399.txt|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p278_400.txt|There's still no-one like him.
p278_401.txt|They know it'll be fantastic.
p278_402.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p278_403.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p278_404.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p278_405.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p278_406.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p278_407.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p278_408.txt|That is the ultimate revenge.
p278_409.txt|The next few months will tell.
p278_410.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p279_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p279_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p279_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p279_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p279_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p279_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p279_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p279_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p279_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p279_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p279_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p279_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p279_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p279_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p279_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p279_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p279_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p279_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p279_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p279_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p279_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p279_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p279_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p279_025.txt|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279_026.txt|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p279_027.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p279_028.txt|They should be so lucky.
p279_029.txt|Is this accurate?
p279_030.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p279_031.txt|There's a story, too.
p279_032.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p279_033.txt|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p279_034.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p279_035.txt|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p279_036.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p279_037.txt|They're just different.
p279_038.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p279_039.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p279_040.txt|President Bush is at war.
p279_041.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p279_042.txt|I was scared.
p279_043.txt|Dancing was her life.
p279_044.txt|It will come all right.
p279_045.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p279_046.txt|We will push.
p279_047.txt|That period was a struggle.
p279_048.txt|It is urgent.
p279_049.txt|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p279_050.txt|The judge said.
p279_051.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p279_052.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p279_053.txt|It's a blessing.
p279_054.txt|But it might have done.
p279_055.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p279_056.txt|As she explains.
p279_057.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p279_058.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p279_059.txt|Life is good.
p279_060.txt|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p279_061.txt|Here's a clue.
p279_062.txt|He had no enemies.
p279_063.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p279_064.txt|We have not given up hope.
p279_065.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p279_066.txt|That's the truth.
p279_067.txt|They were too hard.
p279_068.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p279_069.txt|Art is extra.
p279_070.txt|They're appalled by that.
p279_071.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p279_072.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p279_073.txt|He was popular.
p279_074.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p279_075.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p279_076.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p279_077.txt|It seemed so personal.
p279_078.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p279_079.txt|He had been a singer.
p279_080.txt|I've been there.
p279_081.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p279_082.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p279_083.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p279_084.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p279_085.txt|It works for us.
p279_086.txt|It is a time bomb.
p279_087.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p279_088.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p279_089.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p279_090.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p279_091.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p279_092.txt|They lived for their children.
p279_093.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p279_094.txt|Yet, it worked.
p279_095.txt|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p279_096.txt|It is an old family habit.
p279_097.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p279_098.txt|The peace process will be buried!
p279_099.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p279_100.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p279_101.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p279_102.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p279_103.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p279_104.txt|I see no need for change.
p279_105.txt|That would be unlawful.
p279_106.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p279_107.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p279_108.txt|They will want to perform well.
p279_109.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p279_110.txt|I don't have many friends.
p279_111.txt|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p279_112.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p279_113.txt|I was angry.
p279_114.txt|This is a step backwards.
p279_115.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p279_116.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p279_117.txt|My office is bare.
p279_118.txt|Does this mean.
p279_119.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p279_120.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p279_121.txt|Who would have?
p279_122.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p279_123.txt|We work on the same level.
p279_124.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p279_125.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p279_126.txt|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p279_127.txt|I'm so angry.
p279_128.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p279_129.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p279_130.txt|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p279_131.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p279_132.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p279_133.txt|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p279_134.txt|It will be too hot.
p279_135.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p279_136.txt|I am now unemployed.
p279_137.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p279_138.txt|It's perfectly feasible.
p279_139.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p279_140.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p279_141.txt|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p279_142.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p279_143.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p279_144.txt|Is that Titanic?
p279_145.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p279_146.txt|It is like a football team.
p279_147.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p279_148.txt|They did very well.
p279_149.txt|You know the type.
p279_150.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p279_151.txt|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p279_152.txt|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p279_153.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p279_154.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p279_155.txt|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p279_156.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p279_157.txt|I am very happy with life.
p279_158.txt|These days are long gone.
p279_159.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p279_160.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p279_161.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p279_162.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p279_163.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p279_164.txt|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p279_165.txt|Tell it like it was?
p279_166.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p279_167.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p279_168.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p279_169.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p279_170.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p279_171.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p279_172.txt|His team management was protective.
p279_173.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p279_174.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p279_175.txt|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p279_176.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p279_177.txt|The clarity is vital.
p279_178.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p279_179.txt|I drove the ball well.
p279_180.txt|That has been the easy part.
p279_181.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p279_182.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p279_183.txt|Government will intervene.
p279_184.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p279_185.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p279_186.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p279_187.txt|It's a joke.
p279_188.txt|Does this matter?
p279_189.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p279_190.txt|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p279_191.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p279_192.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p279_193.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p279_194.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p279_195.txt|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p279_196.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p279_197.txt|It was typical.
p279_198.txt|Our strategy is straightforward.
p279_199.txt|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p279_200.txt|I have a cold.
p279_201.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p279_202.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p279_203.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p279_204.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p279_205.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p279_206.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p279_207.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p279_208.txt|There was no rescue.
p279_209.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p279_210.txt|I don't want to use it.
p279_211.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p279_212.txt|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p279_213.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p279_214.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p279_215.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p279_216.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p279_217.txt|By hard work, is the answer.
p279_218.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p279_219.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p279_220.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p279_221.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p279_222.txt|He's a nice guy.
p279_223.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279_224.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p279_225.txt|I am immensely sad.
p279_226.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p279_227.txt|It is a gamble.
p279_228.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p279_229.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p279_230.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p279_231.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p279_232.txt|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p279_233.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p279_234.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p279_235.txt|It is set in Paris.
p279_236.txt|They should come forward.
p279_237.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p279_238.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p279_239.txt|You take a risk.
p279_240.txt|It's too much work.
p279_241.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p279_242.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p279_243.txt|He will go a long way.
p279_244.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279_245.txt|The scene is about this?
p279_246.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p279_247.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p279_248.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p279_249.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p279_250.txt|This year I understood.
p279_251.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p279_252.txt|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p279_253.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p279_254.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p279_255.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p279_256.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p279_257.txt|This is a big club.
p279_258.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p279_259.txt|they fail to engage.
p279_260.txt|People should not become complacent.
p279_261.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p279_262.txt|The warning is timely.
p279_263.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p279_264.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p279_265.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p279_266.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p279_267.txt|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p279_268.txt|It's very nice.
p279_269.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p279_270.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p279_271.txt|It is the same in Sweden.
p279_272.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p279_273.txt|Things can change.
p279_274.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p279_275.txt|The script was funny.
p279_276.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p279_277.txt|She looked so young.
p279_278.txt|It happens from time to time.
p279_279.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p279_280.txt|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279_281.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p279_282.txt|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p279_283.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p279_284.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p279_285.txt|It was a virus.
p279_286.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p279_287.txt|Who will perform?
p279_288.txt|It's like a high school play.
p279_289.txt|It was hopeless.
p279_290.txt|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p279_291.txt|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p279_292.txt|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p279_293.txt|It changed my life.
p279_294.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p279_295.txt|He should have won.
p279_296.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p279_297.txt|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279_298.txt|What has altered?
p279_299.txt|Graeme was prepared.
p279_300.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p279_301.txt|One was a lawyer.
p279_302.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p279_303.txt|They are wrong.
p279_304.txt|This is a war over our home.
p279_305.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p279_306.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p279_307.txt|It was entirely justified.
p279_308.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p279_309.txt|It's certainly different.
p279_310.txt|The letters are going out today.
p279_311.txt|I did not name it.
p279_312.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p279_313.txt|Special measures were needed.
p279_314.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p279_315.txt|They were fantastic.
p279_316.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p279_317.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p279_318.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p279_319.txt|The airport was even different.
p279_320.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p279_321.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p279_322.txt|He got the same story.
p279_323.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p279_324.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p279_325.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p279_326.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p279_327.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279_328.txt|Was this element always there?
p279_329.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p279_330.txt|He did a good job.
p279_331.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p279_332.txt|It is so unfair.
p279_333.txt|It will be very, very tight.
p279_334.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p279_335.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p279_336.txt|The composer will conduct.
p279_337.txt|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p279_338.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p279_339.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p279_340.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p279_341.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p279_342.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p279_343.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p279_344.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p279_345.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p279_346.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p279_347.txt|It is horrible.
p279_348.txt|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p279_349.txt|I kept going for her.
p279_350.txt|He has seen the past.
p279_351.txt|Hartley should know.
p279_352.txt|We are looking for perfection.
p279_353.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p279_354.txt|It's that sort of night.
p279_355.txt|He could make it.
p279_356.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p279_357.txt|I lost my head.
p279_358.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p279_359.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p279_360.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p279_361.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p279_362.txt|So there, we won.
p279_363.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p279_364.txt|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p279_365.txt|There is no signature.
p279_366.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p279_367.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p279_368.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p279_369.txt|He has the edge.
p279_370.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p279_371.txt|He denied the charge.
p279_372.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p279_373.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p279_374.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p279_375.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p279_376.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p279_377.txt|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p279_378.txt|It doesn't always work that way.
p279_379.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p279_380.txt|We try to keep it right.
p279_381.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p279_382.txt|It's like a basketball.
p279_383.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p279_384.txt|I can lead by example.
p279_385.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p279_386.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p279_387.txt|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279_388.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p279_389.txt|It will take place in July.
p279_390.txt|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p279_391.txt|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p279_392.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p279_393.txt|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279_394.txt|He's already made history.
p279_395.txt|So I did.
p279_396.txt|You ask the question.
p279_397.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p279_398.txt|You make the choice.
p279_399.txt|I have been in good form for the last two years.
p279_400.txt|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p279_401.txt|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p279_402.txt|What would be the point?
p279_403.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p279_404.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279_405.txt|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p279_406.txt|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p280_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p280_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p280_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p280_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p280_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p280_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p280_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p280_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p280_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p280_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p280_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p280_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p280_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p280_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p280_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p280_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p280_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p280_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p280_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p280_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p280_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p280_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p280_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p280_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p280_025.txt|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p280_026.txt|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p280_027.txt|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p280_028.txt|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p280_029.txt|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p280_030.txt|She brought a lot to my life.
p280_031.txt|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p280_032.txt|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p280_033.txt|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p280_034.txt|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p280_035.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p280_036.txt|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p280_037.txt|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p280_038.txt|He added that her comments were noted.
p280_039.txt|She will get through it I'm sure.
p280_040.txt|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p280_041.txt|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p280_042.txt|He does not even trust his own members.
p280_043.txt|He too started on the subs seats.
p280_044.txt|Is it worth it ?
p280_045.txt|Does it matter ?
p280_046.txt|How do you take them away ?
p280_047.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p280_048.txt|After the match, do you ?
p280_049.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p280_050.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p280_051.txt|I'm as fit as I can get.
p280_052.txt|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p280_053.txt|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p280_054.txt|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p280_055.txt|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p280_056.txt|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p280_057.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280_058.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p280_059.txt|We just want this season to end.
p280_060.txt|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p280_061.txt|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p280_062.txt|The referee is there to decide these things.
p280_063.txt|There were no details of the other five victims.
p280_064.txt|It also has a good labour supply.
p280_065.txt|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p280_066.txt|Do not give your details to anyone.
p280_067.txt|He was failed by his health authority.
p280_068.txt|But it was not all bad news.
p280_069.txt|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p280_070.txt|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p280_071.txt|It turned me against the whole system.
p280_072.txt|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280_073.txt|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280_074.txt|But two groups refused to sign up.
p280_075.txt|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280_076.txt|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p280_077.txt|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p280_078.txt|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p280_079.txt|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280_080.txt|They said our costs were too high.
p280_081.txt|I do not attempt to answer that.
p280_082.txt|It's been a great evening for us.
p280_083.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p280_084.txt|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280_085.txt|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p280_086.txt|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p280_087.txt|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p280_088.txt|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p280_089.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p280_090.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p280_091.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p280_092.txt|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p280_093.txt|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p280_094.txt|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p280_095.txt|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p280_096.txt|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280_097.txt|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p280_098.txt|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p280_099.txt|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280_100.txt|I am delighted to hear this news.
p280_101.txt|We are already seeing some positive results.
p280_102.txt|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p280_103.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p280_104.txt|They won't actually make any money from it.
p280_105.txt|I bought a flat six years ago.
p280_106.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p280_107.txt|They are a different team at home.
p280_108.txt|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280_109.txt|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p280_110.txt|Some young girls also came by last night.
p280_111.txt|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280_112.txt|What are they for ?
p280_113.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p280_114.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p280_115.txt|So what happens next ?
p280_116.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p280_117.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p280_118.txt|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p280_119.txt|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p280_120.txt|It is the right package for Scotland.
p280_121.txt|They have no real friends in the region.
p280_122.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p280_123.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p280_124.txt|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280_125.txt|I think there's not much between them.
p280_126.txt|So I am going in the right direction.
p280_127.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p280_128.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p280_129.txt|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p280_130.txt|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p280_131.txt|He's got to look after himself now.
p280_132.txt|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p280_133.txt|No country has a similar training programme.
p280_134.txt|There is no future in rock music.
p280_135.txt|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p280_136.txt|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p280_137.txt|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280_138.txt|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p280_139.txt|The programme has been made with great care.
p280_140.txt|There was only one living room, you see.
p280_141.txt|I am not under any new pressure.
p280_142.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p280_143.txt|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280_144.txt|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p280_145.txt|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p280_146.txt|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p280_147.txt|You should feel involved in their lives.
p280_148.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p280_149.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p280_150.txt|Did he trip ?
p280_151.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p280_152.txt|Did it work ?
p280_153.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p280_154.txt|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p280_155.txt|Time may already have run out for this option.
p280_156.txt|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p280_157.txt|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p280_158.txt|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280_159.txt|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p280_160.txt|A progress report will be published in October.
p280_161.txt|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p280_162.txt|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p280_163.txt|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p280_164.txt|Surely it can't run for two years.
p280_165.txt|But the game is still wide open.
p280_166.txt|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p280_167.txt|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p280_168.txt|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p280_169.txt|We had to work very hard for our points.
p280_170.txt|That is a big risk at any price.
p280_171.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p280_172.txt|He said some things which were better left alone.
p280_173.txt|If successful, several records will be made.
p280_174.txt|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280_175.txt|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p280_176.txt|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p280_177.txt|It's just a different way of life.
p280_178.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p280_179.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p280_180.txt|I am secure in my own position.
p280_181.txt|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p280_182.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p280_183.txt|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p280_184.txt|We have come a long way since then.
p280_185.txt|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p280_186.txt|A great player has to win major championships.
p280_187.txt|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280_188.txt|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p280_189.txt|The story was not made public by this club.
p280_190.txt|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p280_191.txt|You are not long home from work.
p280_192.txt|I am fighting the force of nature.
p280_193.txt|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280_194.txt|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p280_195.txt|And they were being paid ?
p280_196.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p280_197.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p280_198.txt|But they had to be paid for.
p280_199.txt|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p280_200.txt|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280_201.txt|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p280_202.txt|I've never had a year like this.
p280_203.txt|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p280_204.txt|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p280_205.txt|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p280_206.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p280_207.txt|I want an answer from the British Government.
p280_208.txt|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280_209.txt|They are a victim of their own success.
p280_210.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p280_211.txt|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p280_212.txt|It is going to change the world.
p280_213.txt|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p280_214.txt|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p280_215.txt|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280_216.txt|I am not going to judge them.
p280_217.txt|I do not see this so much as failure.
p280_218.txt|A European final must be the millennium target.
p280_219.txt|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p280_220.txt|I was independent but I am not now.
p280_221.txt|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p280_222.txt|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p280_223.txt|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p280_224.txt|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p280_225.txt|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p280_227.txt|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p280_228.txt|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p280_229.txt|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p280_230.txt|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280_231.txt|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p280_232.txt|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280_233.txt|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280_234.txt|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p280_235.txt|You are not allowed to do that.
p280_236.txt|That is the last thing they need.

p280_238.txt|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p280_239.txt|Jim was down there with his wife.
p280_240.txt|Was it the wife ?
p280_241.txt|Why change it ?
p280_242.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p280_243.txt|Does the name matter ?
p280_244.txt|how do you get it back ?
p280_245.txt|What are you not good at ?
p280_246.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p280_247.txt|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p280_248.txt|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p280_249.txt|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p280_250.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p280_251.txt|However, the figures tell a different story.
p280_252.txt|The rise has come too late for some.
p280_253.txt|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280_254.txt|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p280_255.txt|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p280_256.txt|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p280_257.txt|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p280_258.txt|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p280_259.txt|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p280_260.txt|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p280_261.txt|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p280_262.txt|There would be a north and south division.
p280_263.txt|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p280_264.txt|The two companies were not for sale.
p280_265.txt|His condition was described as serious last night.
p280_266.txt|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280_267.txt|The board do not own the company.
p280_268.txt|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p280_269.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p280_270.txt|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p280_271.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p280_272.txt|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p280_273.txt|I think I was about four years old.
p280_274.txt|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p280_275.txt|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p280_276.txt|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p280_277.txt|I think the shares are good value.
p280_278.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p280_279.txt|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p280_280.txt|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p280_281.txt|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280_282.txt|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p280_283.txt|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p280_284.txt|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p280_285.txt|There was just fire all around me.
p280_286.txt|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p280_287.txt|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p280_288.txt|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p280_289.txt|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p280_290.txt|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p280_291.txt|He would get into any world team.
p280_292.txt|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280_293.txt|They first met during a Step in London.
p280_294.txt|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p280_295.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p280_296.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p280_297.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p280_298.txt|It is based on population rather than need.
p280_299.txt|He could understand both points of view.
p280_300.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p280_301.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p280_302.txt|And does it ?
p280_303.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p280_304.txt|Had I heard ?
p280_305.txt|What happened in that game ?
p280_306.txt|Are you going to win ?
p280_307.txt|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
p280_308.txt|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p280_309.txt|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p280_310.txt|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p280_311.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p280_312.txt|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p280_313.txt|For that reason cover should not be given.
p280_314.txt|He felt too close to head office.
p280_315.txt|If you believe in the blue and white.
p280_316.txt|A report on their property is due within days.
p280_317.txt|He will just go on doing his job.
p280_318.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p280_319.txt|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p280_320.txt|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280_321.txt|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p280_322.txt|We will not simply hit these people.
p280_323.txt|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p280_324.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p280_325.txt|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p280_326.txt|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p280_327.txt|I try to be open to experience.
p280_328.txt|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p280_329.txt|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p280_330.txt|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p280_331.txt|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p280_332.txt|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p280_333.txt|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280_334.txt|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p280_335.txt|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p280_336.txt|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p280_337.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p280_338.txt|How are you, sir ?
p280_339.txt|So is that it, then ?
p280_340.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p280_341.txt|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p280_342.txt|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p280_343.txt|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p280_344.txt|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280_345.txt|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p280_346.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p280_347.txt|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280_348.txt|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p280_349.txt|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p280_350.txt|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p280_351.txt|I think we are back on track.
p280_352.txt|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p280_353.txt|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280_354.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p280_355.txt|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p280_356.txt|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p280_357.txt|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p280_358.txt|His style was direct and very human.
p280_359.txt|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280_360.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p280_361.txt|The institute board will take the decision.
p280_362.txt|He's young enough and he must learn.
p280_363.txt|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p280_364.txt|Both players gave so much to the side.
p280_365.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280_366.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p280_367.txt|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280_368.txt|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p280_369.txt|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p280_370.txt|I have come here to show support for the families.
p280_371.txt|We have been going for three years.
p280_372.txt|He really played us into a corner.
p280_373.txt|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p280_374.txt|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p280_375.txt|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p280_376.txt|It used to be all hard sell.
p280_377.txt|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p280_378.txt|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p280_379.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p280_380.txt|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p280_381.txt|This is not a small amount of money.
p280_382.txt|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p280_383.txt|I just felt that I was broken down.
p280_384.txt|What do we do ?
p280_385.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p280_386.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p280_387.txt|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p280_388.txt|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p280_389.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p280_390.txt|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p280_391.txt|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p280_392.txt|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p280_393.txt|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280_394.txt|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p280_395.txt|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p280_396.txt|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p280_397.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p280_398.txt|People have a wish to charge twice.
p280_399.txt|I think it's a big advantage to us.
p280_400.txt|There were no hard words between us.
p280_401.txt|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
p280_402.txt|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
p280_403.txt|These old songs are very nice to play.
p280_404.txt|My views on the decision are well known.
p280_405.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p280_406.txt|We were on top and could have won.
p280_407.txt|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280_408.txt|So it looks like a done deal.
p280_409.txt|The play was to go straight ahead.
p280_410.txt|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
p281_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p281_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p281_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p281_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p281_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p281_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p281_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p281_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p281_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p281_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p281_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p281_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p281_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p281_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p281_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p281_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p281_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p281_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p281_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p281_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p281_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p281_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p281_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p281_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p281_026.txt|They are very clever in their use of words.
p281_027.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p281_028.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p281_029.txt|It's not going to work out that way.
p281_030.txt|They've got their own agenda.
p281_031.txt|I'd just like to play.
p281_032.txt|Our fans have been marvellous.
p281_033.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p281_034.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p281_035.txt|She failed in her action.
p281_036.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p281_037.txt|It carried a double message.
p281_038.txt|It is a financial matter.
p281_039.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p281_040.txt|They want to be entertained.
p281_041.txt|A week is a long time in politics.
p281_042.txt|I am just going to go for it.
p281_043.txt|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p281_044.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p281_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p281_046.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p281_047.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p281_048.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p281_049.txt|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p281_050.txt|I had come back from London.
p281_051.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p281_052.txt|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281_053.txt|I must take a seat.
p281_054.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p281_055.txt|The Government should be ashamed.
p281_056.txt|None has ever been found.
p281_057.txt|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p281_058.txt|We should be able to cope.
p281_059.txt|It was a lovely experience.
p281_060.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p281_061.txt|We will pay their bills.
p281_062.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p281_063.txt|The standard is extremely high.
p281_064.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p281_065.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p281_066.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p281_067.txt|It is a real problem.
p281_068.txt|I have proved that in the past.
p281_069.txt|He had been a singer.
p281_070.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p281_071.txt|How are you, sir ?
p281_072.txt|So is that it, then ?
p281_073.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p281_074.txt|The players will be down.
p281_075.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p281_076.txt|There could be a lot of confusion.
p281_077.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p281_078.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p281_079.txt|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p281_080.txt|He is in the queue.
p281_081.txt|I first met him last summer.
p281_082.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p281_083.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p281_084.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p281_085.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p281_086.txt|The error appeared in a warrant.
p281_087.txt|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p281_088.txt|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p281_089.txt|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p281_090.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p281_091.txt|We could not get any possession.
p281_092.txt|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p281_093.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p281_094.txt|The conclusion is the same.
p281_095.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p281_096.txt|But I know the course.
p281_097.txt|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p281_098.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p281_099.txt|This is a national crisis.
p281_100.txt|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p281_101.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p281_102.txt|Movement has to take place.
p281_103.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p281_104.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p281_105.txt|It's not a lack of confidence.
p281_106.txt|It was a funny game.
p281_107.txt|What do we do ?
p281_108.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p281_109.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p281_110.txt|That is the only way forward.
p281_111.txt|They are at a very early stage.
p281_112.txt|The whole thing is the music.
p281_113.txt|Or it would have been.
p281_114.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p281_115.txt|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p281_116.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p281_117.txt|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p281_118.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p281_119.txt|They've got to account for it.
p281_120.txt|Then again, we could have.
p281_121.txt|We have a training class.
p281_122.txt|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p281_123.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p281_124.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p281_125.txt|She does not want to speak.
p281_126.txt|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p281_127.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p281_128.txt|That is far too high.
p281_129.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p281_130.txt|There were no serious injuries.
p281_131.txt|She was also very brave.
p281_132.txt|He wants to win a major.
p281_133.txt|First meeting was next week.
p281_134.txt|I never wanted a legal battle.
p281_135.txt|We will try to find someone.
p281_136.txt|People come from all round the world to see it.
p281_137.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p281_138.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p281_139.txt|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p281_140.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p281_141.txt|It is not just about pay.
p281_142.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p281_143.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p281_144.txt|I was caught out a little bit.
p281_145.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p281_146.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p281_147.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p281_148.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p281_149.txt|It is not normal practice.
p281_150.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p281_151.txt|The family kept away from me.
p281_152.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p281_153.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p281_154.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p281_155.txt|And does it ?
p281_156.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p281_157.txt|Had I heard ?
p281_158.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p281_159.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p281_160.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p281_161.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p281_162.txt|It is a terrible tragedy.
p281_163.txt|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p281_164.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p281_165.txt|We have a budget in March.
p281_166.txt|The pension levels will remain the same.
p281_167.txt|They will do their own thing.
p281_168.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p281_169.txt|Our position remains the same.
p281_170.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p281_171.txt|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p281_172.txt|They could not match it.
p281_173.txt|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p281_174.txt|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p281_175.txt|One season, they might do well.
p281_176.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p281_177.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p281_178.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p281_179.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p281_180.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p281_181.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p281_182.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p281_183.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p281_184.txt|They know no other way.
p281_185.txt|The referee had a good game.
p281_186.txt|I am not ready to walk away.
p281_187.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p281_188.txt|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p281_189.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p281_190.txt|He prefers to play for them.
p281_191.txt|I have accepted the challenge.
p281_192.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p281_193.txt|They were seriously after him.
p281_194.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p281_195.txt|And this game is all about belief.
p281_196.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p281_197.txt|That would be my view.
p281_198.txt|It decided to blame the media.
p281_199.txt|We always felt we could win.
p281_200.txt|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p281_201.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p281_202.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p281_203.txt|Because he was born in England.
p281_204.txt|There was no way back for United after that.
p281_205.txt|It was a test in itself.
p281_206.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p281_207.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p281_208.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p281_209.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p281_210.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p281_211.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p281_212.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p281_213.txt|This is a holy place.
p281_214.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p281_215.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p281_216.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p281_217.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p281_218.txt|You are a great player.
p281_219.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p281_220.txt|Does the name matter ?
p281_221.txt|how do you get it back ?
p281_222.txt|What are you not good at ?
p281_223.txt|You have got to look at speed of response.
p281_224.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p281_225.txt|We're very unhappy about it.
p281_226.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p281_227.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p281_228.txt|I had relied on him.
p281_229.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p281_230.txt|It had all been arranged.
p281_231.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p281_232.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p281_233.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p281_234.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p281_235.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p281_236.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p281_237.txt|It was a crazy day.
p281_238.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p281_239.txt|That has been the easy part.
p281_240.txt|You could feel the heat.
p281_241.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p281_242.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p281_243.txt|This is the year of the Tiger.
p281_244.txt|Wilson will tell the truth.
p281_245.txt|She died in middle age.
p281_246.txt|We just had a go.
p281_247.txt|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p281_248.txt|It is set in Paris.
p281_249.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p281_250.txt|That is still in place.
p281_251.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p281_252.txt|The irony was not lost.
p281_253.txt|The pig industry is on its knees.
p281_254.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p281_255.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p281_256.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p281_257.txt|She took them for a term.
p281_258.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p281_259.txt|You can never tell with the manager.
p281_260.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p281_261.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p281_262.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p281_263.txt|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p281_264.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p281_265.txt|I should think so, too.
p281_266.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p281_267.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p281_268.txt|That would depend on the parole board.
p281_269.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p281_270.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p281_271.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p281_272.txt|He looked like a schoolboy.
p281_273.txt|England could only play the other team on the park.
p281_274.txt|He took over our lives.
p281_275.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p281_276.txt|We feel very good about it.
p281_277.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p281_278.txt|For him then it's a labour of love.
p281_279.txt|We are aiming for early March.
p281_280.txt|It is also very valuable.
p281_281.txt|The demand is created by the supply.
p281_282.txt|Not many companies can say that these days.
p281_283.txt|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p281_284.txt|That view has not altered.
p281_285.txt|And they were being paid ?
p281_286.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p281_287.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p281_288.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p281_289.txt|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p281_290.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p281_291.txt|He was also married with two children.
p281_292.txt|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p281_293.txt|You have to expect this type of thing.
p281_294.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p281_295.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p281_296.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p281_297.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p281_298.txt|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p281_299.txt|This is the correct decision.
p281_300.txt|He added that the business was in good shape.
p281_301.txt|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p281_302.txt|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p281_303.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p281_304.txt|We are not doing the Today programme.
p281_305.txt|There should be room for creative dissent.
p281_306.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p281_307.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p281_308.txt|The real issue is personal.
p281_309.txt|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p281_310.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p281_311.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p281_312.txt|The dealer is on notice.
p281_313.txt|The party lasted all night.
p281_314.txt|We are in the end game.
p281_315.txt|They come to enjoy themselves.
p281_316.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p281_317.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p281_318.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p281_319.txt|This may be perfectly innocent.
p281_320.txt|Scotland has shown the way.
p281_321.txt|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p281_322.txt|The letters are going out today.
p281_323.txt|I can see their argument.
p281_324.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p281_325.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p281_326.txt|The whole family was in shock.
p281_327.txt|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p281_328.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p281_329.txt|There is no shortage of farmers.
p281_330.txt|It's difficult to predict the future.
p281_331.txt|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p281_332.txt|But the Farmer is bemused.
p281_333.txt|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p281_334.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p281_335.txt|The airport was even different.
p281_336.txt|There was no time scale.
p281_337.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p281_338.txt|Did it work ?
p281_339.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p281_340.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p281_341.txt|It's just the way I play.
p281_342.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p281_343.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p281_344.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p281_345.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p281_346.txt|It was almost too much.
p281_347.txt|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
p281_348.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p281_349.txt|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p281_350.txt|He did a good job.
p281_351.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p281_352.txt|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p281_353.txt|I think this proposal is excellent.
p281_354.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p281_355.txt|He deserves a top team.
p281_356.txt|It is all about having physical evidence.
p281_357.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p281_358.txt|I said she was very young.
p281_359.txt|He had no previous convictions.
p281_360.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p281_361.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p281_362.txt|Neither woman has been named.
p281_363.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p281_364.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p281_365.txt|I got a yellow card.
p281_366.txt|There will be no final dividend.
p281_367.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p281_368.txt|The major championships will always have a special place.
p281_369.txt|She said they would appeal.
p281_370.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p281_371.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p281_372.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p281_373.txt|The shares are a strong hold.
p281_374.txt|It would be quite nice.
p281_375.txt|There was a thing in front of the camera.
p281_376.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p281_377.txt|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p281_378.txt|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p281_379.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p281_380.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p281_381.txt|He has seen the past.
p281_382.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p281_383.txt|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p281_384.txt|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p281_385.txt|He has been a success this year.
p281_386.txt|In fact, he was great today.
p281_387.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p281_388.txt|A review is under way.
p281_389.txt|It is a simple equation.
p281_390.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p281_391.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p281_392.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p281_393.txt|Are they free ?
p281_394.txt|What are they for ?
p281_395.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p281_396.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p281_397.txt|That investment has now been secured.
p281_398.txt|He had returned to die.
p281_399.txt|It is hard to understand.
p281_400.txt|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p281_401.txt|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p281_402.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p281_403.txt|The casualties were not named.
p281_404.txt|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p281_405.txt|It had been on the cards.
p281_406.txt|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p281_407.txt|It was the same expression of joy.
p281_408.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p281_409.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p281_410.txt|That was a touch of class.
p281_411.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p281_412.txt|That is a personal matter.
p281_413.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p281_414.txt|We will stand for the nation.
p281_415.txt|Is it worth it ?
p281_416.txt|Does it matter ?
p281_417.txt|How do you take them away ?
p281_418.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p281_419.txt|After the match, do you ?
p281_420.txt|I am delighted for them.
p281_421.txt|Footballers have also been targeted.
p281_422.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p281_423.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p281_424.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p281_425.txt|That's the way it works.
p281_426.txt|The professor is in no doubt.
p281_427.txt|It was a poor performance.
p281_428.txt|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p281_429.txt|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p281_430.txt|Once again, they would be wrong.
p281_431.txt|Together, we can make a difference.
p281_432.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p281_433.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p281_434.txt|We might be back next year.
p281_435.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p281_436.txt|Size is not the issue.
p281_437.txt|It was support as it should be.
p281_438.txt|I didn't get to keep it.
p281_439.txt|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p281_440.txt|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p281_441.txt|He deserves a second chance.
p281_442.txt|It is pretty bad news.
p281_443.txt|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281_444.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p281_445.txt|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p281_446.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p281_447.txt|I was embarrassed by it.
p281_448.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p281_449.txt|She came to the Highland Show.
p281_450.txt|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p281_451.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p281_452.txt|They were good years for him.
p281_453.txt|We're all paying for it.
p281_454.txt|This is the stuff of live music.
p281_455.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p281_456.txt|We could hardly believe it.
p281_457.txt|The men are very worried.
p281_458.txt|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p281_459.txt|We are going through the process.
p281_460.txt|It must never be seen as second class.
p282_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p282_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p282_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p282_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p282_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p282_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p282_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p282_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p282_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p282_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p282_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p282_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p282_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p282_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p282_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p282_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p282_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p282_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p282_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p282_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p282_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p282_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p282_025.txt|But it failed.
p282_026.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p282_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p282_028.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p282_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p282_030.txt|This is the window.
p282_031.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p282_032.txt|Help is needed.
p282_033.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p282_034.txt|It is marvellous.
p282_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p282_036.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p282_037.txt|They're just different.
p282_038.txt|It was clear.
p282_039.txt|Indeed, he does.
p282_040.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p282_041.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p282_042.txt|Dancing was her life.
p282_043.txt|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p282_044.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p282_045.txt|They want to be entertained.
p282_046.txt|It's the only thing.
p282_047.txt|You had better believe it.
p282_048.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p282_049.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p282_050.txt|A neighbour said.
p282_051.txt|It is bizarre.
p282_052.txt|There is no reason at all.
p282_053.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p282_054.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p282_055.txt|Our people are ready.
p282_056.txt|Here's a clue.
p282_057.txt|I was lost.
p282_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p282_059.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p282_060.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p282_061.txt|It is unique.
p282_062.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p282_063.txt|It happened so quickly.
p282_064.txt|That's the truth.
p282_065.txt|It seems to have worked.
p282_066.txt|This is the first step.
p282_067.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_068.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p282_069.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p282_070.txt|But I've won both ways.
p282_071.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282_072.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p282_073.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p282_074.txt|It could take some time.
p282_075.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p282_076.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p282_077.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p282_078.txt|The party is up for it.
p282_079.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p282_080.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p282_081.txt|What has changed?
p282_082.txt|I will miss him.
p282_083.txt|He is in the queue.
p282_084.txt|I first met him last summer.
p282_085.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_086.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p282_087.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p282_088.txt|They lived for their children.
p282_089.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p282_090.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p282_091.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p282_092.txt|We are on the path of change.
p282_093.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p282_094.txt|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p282_095.txt|Yet, it worked.
p282_096.txt|He's been hit by it.
p282_097.txt|I love the Dome.
p282_098.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p282_099.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p282_100.txt|It is a love affair.
p282_101.txt|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p282_102.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p282_103.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p282_104.txt|That would be unlawful.
p282_105.txt|I don't want to use it.
p282_106.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p282_107.txt|It was an adventure.
p282_108.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p282_109.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p282_110.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p282_111.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p282_112.txt|Is that right?
p282_113.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p282_114.txt|It's a shame.
p282_115.txt|It was the eighties.
p282_116.txt|It is so sad.
p282_117.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p282_118.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p282_119.txt|It is rubbish.
p282_120.txt|Who would be a referee?
p282_121.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p282_122.txt|We enjoyed it today.
p282_123.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p282_124.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p282_125.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p282_126.txt|I'm so angry.
p282_127.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p282_128.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p282_129.txt|It is not a U-turn.
p282_130.txt|No production was achieved.
p282_131.txt|I am now unemployed.
p282_132.txt|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p282_133.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p282_134.txt|We work well together.
p282_135.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p282_136.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p282_137.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p282_138.txt|I was dead.
p282_139.txt|I don't know the full story.
p282_140.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p282_141.txt|She died at her home.
p282_142.txt|He realises his mistake.
p282_143.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p282_144.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p282_145.txt|I was awful.
p282_146.txt|Who would have?
p282_147.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p282_148.txt|It is not just about pay.
p282_149.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p282_150.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p282_151.txt|I was stunned.
p282_152.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p282_153.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p282_154.txt|They have not been named.
p282_155.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p282_156.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p282_157.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p282_158.txt|Words were not required.
p282_159.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p282_160.txt|Life becomes a song.
p282_161.txt|Well, he should know.
p282_162.txt|Was this element always there?
p282_163.txt|These days are long gone.
p282_164.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p282_165.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p282_166.txt|It has to be now.
p282_167.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p282_168.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p282_169.txt|We have a budget in March.
p282_170.txt|We should do everything at a stroke.
p282_171.txt|You had to go and see him.
p282_172.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p282_173.txt|In a way he was.
p282_174.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p282_175.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p282_176.txt|As we worked.
p282_177.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p282_178.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p282_179.txt|The goals were good.
p282_180.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p282_181.txt|It's an idea.
p282_182.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p282_183.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p282_184.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p282_185.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p282_186.txt|Does this matter?
p282_187.txt|Our team is just so young.
p282_188.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p282_189.txt|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282_190.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p282_191.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p282_192.txt|We speak about the performance.
p282_193.txt|It is a farce.
p282_194.txt|Peace was won.
p282_195.txt|It's a fact.
p282_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p282_197.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p282_198.txt|Is that success?
p282_199.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p282_200.txt|Who will pay for this?
p282_201.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p282_202.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p282_203.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p282_204.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p282_205.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p282_206.txt|Feel the heat?
p282_207.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p282_208.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p282_209.txt|It had all been arranged.
p282_210.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p282_211.txt|Work has started.
p282_212.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p282_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p282_214.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p282_215.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p282_216.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p282_217.txt|Then another one came.
p282_218.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p282_219.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p282_220.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p282_221.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p282_222.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p282_223.txt|It's not before time.
p282_224.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p282_225.txt|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p282_226.txt|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p282_227.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p282_228.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p282_229.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p282_230.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p282_231.txt|We are so proud.
p282_232.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p282_233.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p282_234.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p282_235.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p282_236.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p282_237.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p282_238.txt|It is hard won.
p282_239.txt|Our policy is clear.
p282_240.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p282_241.txt|The scene is about this?
p282_242.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p282_243.txt|My son was too young to die.
p282_244.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p282_245.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p282_246.txt|It was a hit.
p282_247.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p282_248.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p282_249.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p282_250.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p282_251.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p282_252.txt|they fail to engage.
p282_253.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p282_254.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p282_255.txt|They must play for each other.
p282_256.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p282_257.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p282_258.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p282_259.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p282_260.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p282_261.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p282_262.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p282_263.txt|He was also married with two children.
p282_264.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p282_265.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p282_266.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p282_267.txt|One knows the feeling.
p282_268.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p282_269.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p282_270.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p282_271.txt|She failed in her action.
p282_272.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p282_273.txt|She looked so young.
p282_274.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p282_275.txt|It's so awful.
p282_276.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p282_277.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p282_278.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p282_279.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p282_280.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p282_281.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p282_282.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p282_283.txt|Who will perform?
p282_284.txt|This is a national crisis.
p282_285.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p282_286.txt|She is really magic.
p282_287.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p282_288.txt|I was the sheep.
p282_289.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p282_290.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p282_291.txt|Nothing is safe.
p282_292.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p282_293.txt|One was a lawyer.
p282_294.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p282_295.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p282_296.txt|They are wrong.
p282_297.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p282_298.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p282_299.txt|It could work.
p282_300.txt|This is a war over our home.
p282_301.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p282_302.txt|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p282_303.txt|You should be.
p282_304.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p282_305.txt|The letters are going out today.
p282_306.txt|Is there on his hands?
p282_307.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p282_308.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p282_309.txt|She is very distinctive.
p282_310.txt|We have got to get the points from this one.
p282_311.txt|You may have a short memory.
p282_312.txt|Henman has been warned.
p282_313.txt|We are in the end game.
p282_314.txt|It will work.
p282_315.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p282_316.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p282_317.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p282_318.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p282_319.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p282_320.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p282_321.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p282_322.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p282_323.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p282_324.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p282_325.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p282_326.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p282_327.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p282_328.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p282_329.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p282_330.txt|I've got no secret.
p282_331.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p282_332.txt|This is a friendly match?
p282_333.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p282_334.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p282_335.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p282_336.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p282_337.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p282_338.txt|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p282_339.txt|She is free.
p282_340.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p282_341.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p282_342.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p282_343.txt|Yet he left a few days later.
p282_344.txt|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p282_345.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p282_346.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p282_347.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p282_348.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p282_349.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p282_350.txt|That would help.
p282_351.txt|My husband was angry.
p282_352.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p282_353.txt|And he laughs.
p282_354.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p282_355.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p282_356.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p282_357.txt|Their time has gone.
p282_358.txt|He could make it.
p282_359.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p282_360.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p282_361.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p282_362.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p282_363.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p282_364.txt|It is a simple equation.
p282_365.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p282_366.txt|It was a funny game.
p282_367.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p282_368.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p282_369.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p282_370.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p283_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p283_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p283_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p283_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p283_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p283_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p283_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p283_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p283_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p283_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p283_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p283_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p283_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p283_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p283_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p283_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p283_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p283_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p283_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p283_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p283_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p283_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p283_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p283_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p283_025.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p283_026.txt|We are a service industry.
p283_027.txt|It's not going to work out that way.
p283_028.txt|The idea is not new.
p283_029.txt|Because we do not need it.
p283_030.txt|And we have a singer.
p283_031.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p283_032.txt|We speak about the performance.
p283_033.txt|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p283_034.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p283_035.txt|It could well be the case.
p283_036.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p283_037.txt|That means an extra two years.
p283_038.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p283_039.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p283_040.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p283_041.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p283_042.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p283_043.txt|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p283_044.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p283_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p283_046.txt|I was released after six days.
p283_047.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p283_048.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p283_049.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p283_050.txt|Clearly, they had other problems.
p283_051.txt|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
p283_052.txt|I would say the position is open.
p283_053.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p283_054.txt|I had come back from London.
p283_055.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p283_056.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p283_057.txt|There was no safety net.
p283_058.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p283_059.txt|How are you, sir ?
p283_060.txt|So is that it, then ?
p283_061.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p283_062.txt|What do we do ?
p283_063.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p283_064.txt|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p283_065.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p283_066.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p283_067.txt|This is the year of the Tiger.
p283_068.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p283_069.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p283_070.txt|The Government should be ashamed.
p283_071.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p283_072.txt|You do not change overnight.
p283_073.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p283_074.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p283_075.txt|We will pay their bills.
p283_076.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p283_077.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p283_078.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p283_079.txt|It is very special for me.
p283_080.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p283_081.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283_082.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283_083.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283_084.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p283_085.txt|The result is a vacuum.
p283_086.txt|It looks like a hit.
p283_087.txt|I'd like to see the business case.
p283_088.txt|It makes for an interesting conference.
p283_089.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p283_090.txt|You have to respect the office.
p283_091.txt|He has been a success this year.
p283_092.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p283_093.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p283_094.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p283_095.txt|They lived for their children.
p283_096.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p283_097.txt|The trick is to try it.
p283_098.txt|Little is known about them.
p283_099.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p283_100.txt|It really was an unusual award.
p283_101.txt|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p283_102.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p283_103.txt|We could not get any possession.
p283_104.txt|That is the important thing.
p283_105.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p283_106.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p283_107.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p283_108.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p283_109.txt|And does it ?
p283_110.txt|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p283_111.txt|It's good to have a voice.
p283_112.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p283_113.txt|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p283_114.txt|Their attitude is all wrong.
p283_115.txt|We made a world record together.
p283_116.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p283_117.txt|It's for that reason he should resign.
p283_118.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p283_119.txt|It's been a long wait.
p283_120.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p283_121.txt|Our house was very small.
p283_122.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p283_123.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p283_124.txt|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p283_125.txt|Sport is good for you.
p283_126.txt|It was won on the issue of the land.
p283_127.txt|I am a committed European.
p283_128.txt|From it emerged a cup.
p283_129.txt|That was the first step.
p283_130.txt|That might help a bit.
p283_131.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p283_132.txt|We would make a start.
p283_133.txt|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p283_134.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p283_135.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p283_136.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p283_137.txt|This should begin in October.
p283_138.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p283_139.txt|We did what we had to do.
p283_140.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p283_141.txt|But it is different in different regions.
p283_142.txt|Last night, the row continued.
p283_143.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p283_144.txt|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p283_145.txt|We are entirely happy with Russell.
p283_146.txt|It's not a U-turn at all.
p283_147.txt|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p283_148.txt|He was a home referee.
p283_149.txt|Before it was an ordeal.
p283_150.txt|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p283_151.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p283_152.txt|I'm so grateful for that.
p283_153.txt|It will be retained as part of the group.
p283_154.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p283_155.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p283_156.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p283_157.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p283_158.txt|It has become a way of life.
p283_159.txt|I was caught out a little bit.
p283_160.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p283_161.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p283_162.txt|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p283_163.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p283_164.txt|What happened in that game ?
p283_165.txt|Are you going to win ?
p283_166.txt|Was it the wife ?
p283_167.txt|Why change it ?
p283_168.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p283_169.txt|It has to be an event.
p283_170.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p283_171.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p283_172.txt|It was by the numbers.
p283_173.txt|Today I had no failures in my team.
p283_174.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p283_175.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p283_176.txt|He was asked to quit.
p283_177.txt|There is no reason at all.
p283_178.txt|The woman was his wife.
p283_179.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p283_180.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p283_181.txt|The research was my life.
p283_182.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p283_183.txt|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
p283_184.txt|I am a good player.
p283_185.txt|He was in great spirits.
p283_186.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p283_187.txt|We have a budget in March.
p283_188.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p283_189.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p283_190.txt|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p283_191.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p283_192.txt|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p283_193.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p283_194.txt|It was to be inclusive.
p283_195.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p283_196.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p283_197.txt|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p283_198.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p283_199.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p283_200.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p283_201.txt|Does the name matter ?
p283_202.txt|how do you get it back ?
p283_203.txt|What are you not good at ?
p283_204.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p283_205.txt|Who was she ?
p283_206.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p283_207.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p283_208.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p283_209.txt|She was married with one son.
p283_210.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p283_211.txt|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
p283_212.txt|We are not making any comment.
p283_213.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p283_214.txt|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p283_215.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p283_216.txt|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p283_217.txt|I will work on her.
p283_218.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p283_219.txt|We always felt we could win.
p283_220.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p283_221.txt|They are still very quiet.
p283_222.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p283_223.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p283_224.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p283_225.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p283_226.txt|You could feel the heat.
p283_227.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p283_228.txt|That is the real test.
p283_229.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p283_230.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p283_231.txt|Consumers have the right to choose.
p283_232.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p283_233.txt|This is a holy place.
p283_234.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p283_235.txt|This will take several weeks.
p283_236.txt|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p283_237.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p283_238.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p283_239.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p283_240.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p283_241.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p283_242.txt|I had relied on him.
p283_243.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p283_244.txt|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p283_245.txt|It was a great experience.
p283_246.txt|His second was a beauty.
p283_247.txt|These will take a little time to develop.
p283_248.txt|There's a chance they might come down.
p283_249.txt|This is an exciting time for the party.
p283_250.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p283_251.txt|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
p283_252.txt|It was a crazy day.
p283_253.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p283_254.txt|Our future is in their hands.
p283_255.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p283_256.txt|It could be to do with the location.
p283_257.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p283_258.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p283_259.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p283_260.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p283_261.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p283_262.txt|They have not been in touch with the club.
p283_263.txt|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p283_264.txt|She claimed the day was for young people.
p283_265.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p283_266.txt|It had so much to do with output.
p283_267.txt|She died in middle age.
p283_268.txt|And they were being paid ?
p283_269.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p283_270.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p283_271.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p283_272.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p283_273.txt|Did he trip ?
p283_274.txt|That takes a lot of courage.
p283_275.txt|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p283_276.txt|The irony was not lost.
p283_277.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p283_278.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p283_279.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p283_280.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p283_281.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p283_282.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p283_283.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p283_284.txt|You can never tell with the manager.
p283_285.txt|We need to establish the facts.
p283_286.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p283_287.txt|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p283_288.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p283_289.txt|My son was too young to die.
p283_290.txt|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p283_291.txt|I should think so, too.
p283_292.txt|My office is down there.
p283_293.txt|None of the agencies was able to help.
p283_294.txt|I told you I was ill.
p283_295.txt|We accept the new rules.
p283_296.txt|He looked like a schoolboy.
p283_297.txt|They are very keen to work with us.
p283_298.txt|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p283_299.txt|The next month is very important.
p283_300.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p283_301.txt|This is a total mystery.
p283_302.txt|At first I thought I was gone.
p283_303.txt|It is the end of an adventure.
p283_304.txt|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p283_305.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p283_306.txt|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p283_307.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p283_308.txt|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p283_309.txt|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p283_310.txt|My whole life has changed.
p283_311.txt|It was never a free kick.
p283_312.txt|It further expressed his defiance.
p283_313.txt|He said he was sorry.
p283_314.txt|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p283_315.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p283_316.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p283_317.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p283_318.txt|If not, he should go home.
p283_319.txt|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p283_320.txt|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p283_321.txt|This is the correct decision.
p283_322.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p283_323.txt|The Project is far from that.
p283_324.txt|What form did that take ?
p283_326.txt|What are they for ?
p283_327.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p283_328.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p283_329.txt|So what happens next ?
p283_330.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p283_331.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p283_332.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p283_333.txt|No final decision has been taken.
p283_334.txt|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p283_335.txt|I was there five months ago.
p283_336.txt|Well, he can do it.
p283_337.txt|The songs are just so good.
p283_338.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p283_339.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p283_340.txt|A new school will be built.
p283_341.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p283_342.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p283_343.txt|It became a book by itself.
p283_344.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p283_345.txt|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p283_346.txt|The party lasted all night.
p283_347.txt|But I think it's different from the rest!
p283_348.txt|It is a matter of clarity.
p283_349.txt|He did that every night I was with him.
p283_350.txt|They come to enjoy themselves.
p283_351.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p283_352.txt|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283_353.txt|And he goes with it.
p283_354.txt|My life is exactly the same.
p283_356.txt|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p283_357.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p283_358.txt|We will listen to any suggestion.
p283_359.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p283_360.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p283_361.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p283_362.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p283_363.txt|They were impressive against France.
p283_364.txt|The airport was even different.
p283_365.txt|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p283_366.txt|He was at school in Devon.
p283_367.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p283_368.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p283_369.txt|Last weekend he was awful.
p283_370.txt|There is a range of employers.
p283_371.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p283_372.txt|Ferguson is a good example.
p283_373.txt|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p283_374.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p283_375.txt|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283_376.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p283_377.txt|I said she was very young.
p283_378.txt|He had no previous convictions.
p283_379.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p283_380.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p283_381.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p283_382.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p283_383.txt|Is it worth it ?
p283_384.txt|Does it matter ?
p283_385.txt|That can be good for us.
p283_386.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p283_387.txt|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
p283_388.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p283_389.txt|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p283_390.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p283_391.txt|It would be quite nice.
p283_392.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p283_393.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p283_394.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p283_395.txt|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p283_396.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p283_397.txt|We came across the first set of bodies.
p283_398.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p283_399.txt|It has only been rumours.
p283_400.txt|Final proposals will be published in February.
p283_401.txt|I could not live with it.
p283_402.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p283_403.txt|A review is under way.
p283_404.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p283_405.txt|There is a lack of logic.
p283_406.txt|That investment has now been secured.
p283_407.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p283_408.txt|It proved a good decision.
p283_409.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p283_410.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p283_411.txt|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283_412.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p283_413.txt|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
p283_414.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p283_415.txt|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p283_416.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p283_417.txt|The second goal was superb.
p283_418.txt|That's all I can say.
p283_419.txt|How do you take them away ?
p283_420.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p283_421.txt|After the match, do you ?
p283_422.txt|I am astonished at attack.
p283_423.txt|I was pleased with my own game.
p283_424.txt|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p283_425.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p283_426.txt|No date has been set for a meeting.
p283_427.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p283_428.txt|That is a personal matter.
p283_429.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p283_430.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p283_431.txt|These guys are looking for business.
p283_432.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p283_433.txt|I would rather look at him.
p283_434.txt|It needs to be volatile.
p283_435.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283_436.txt|It is based on a true story.
p283_437.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p283_438.txt|Being with me is an honour.
p283_439.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p283_440.txt|Which may be the same thing.
p283_441.txt|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p283_442.txt|We shall not forget him.
p283_443.txt|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p283_444.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p283_445.txt|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p283_446.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p283_447.txt|Something has got to give.
p283_448.txt|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p283_449.txt|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
p283_450.txt|We went straight into the bedroom.
p283_451.txt|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
p283_452.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p283_453.txt|I was embarrassed by it.
p283_454.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283_455.txt|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p283_456.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p283_457.txt|I'd never run for them.
p283_458.txt|She came to the Highland Show.
p283_459.txt|He was confronted by police.
p283_460.txt|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283_461.txt|She has reached the top of her profession.
p283_462.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p283_463.txt|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p283_464.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p283_465.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p283_466.txt|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p283_467.txt|It all began as an accident.
p283_468.txt|We are going through the process.
p283_469.txt|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
p283_470.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p283_471.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p284_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p284_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p284_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p284_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p284_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p284_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p284_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p284_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p284_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p284_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p284_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p284_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p284_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p284_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p284_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p284_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p284_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p284_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p284_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p284_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p284_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p284_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p284_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p284_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p284_025.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p284_026.txt|We will be homeless.
p284_027.txt|Is this accurate?
p284_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p284_029.txt|They have no history.
p284_030.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p284_031.txt|I'd just like to play.
p284_032.txt|There's a story, too.
p284_033.txt|This is the window.
p284_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p284_035.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p284_036.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p284_037.txt|It's a fact.
p284_038.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p284_039.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p284_040.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p284_041.txt|Dancing was her life.
p284_042.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p284_043.txt|We will push.
p284_044.txt|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p284_045.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p284_046.txt|It is marvellous.
p284_047.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p284_048.txt|Our people are ready.
p284_049.txt|Here's a clue.
p284_050.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p284_051.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p284_052.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p284_053.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p284_054.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p284_055.txt|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p284_056.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p284_057.txt|What was the main difference?
p284_058.txt|There's a danger.
p284_059.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284_060.txt|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p284_061.txt|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p284_062.txt|It's that kind of place.
p284_063.txt|They are real.
p284_064.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p284_065.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p284_066.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p284_067.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p284_068.txt|We should have known.
p284_069.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p284_070.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p284_071.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p284_072.txt|It was magic.
p284_073.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p284_074.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p284_075.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p284_076.txt|The party is up for it.
p284_077.txt|Even the one she loved.
p284_078.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p284_079.txt|Today she has been released.
p284_080.txt|Who will pay for this?
p284_081.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p284_082.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p284_083.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p284_084.txt|They lived for their children.
p284_085.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p284_086.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p284_087.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p284_088.txt|It is a lifeline.
p284_089.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p284_090.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p284_091.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p284_092.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p284_093.txt|Then came the crunch.
p284_094.txt|It is annoying.
p284_095.txt|I love the Dome.
p284_096.txt|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p284_097.txt|I am extremely sad.
p284_098.txt|It is a love affair.
p284_099.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p284_100.txt|May not have been at fault?
p284_101.txt|They tried to deny it.
p284_102.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p284_103.txt|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p284_104.txt|That's all right then.
p284_105.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p284_106.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p284_107.txt|She reflects a bit.
p284_108.txt|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p284_109.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p284_110.txt|It was a funny game.
p284_111.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p284_112.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p284_113.txt|It was the eighties.
p284_114.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p284_115.txt|It is so sad.
p284_116.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p284_117.txt|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p284_118.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p284_119.txt|It is rubbish.
p284_120.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p284_121.txt|We enjoyed it today.
p284_122.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p284_123.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p284_124.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p284_125.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p284_126.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p284_127.txt|The people will come.
p284_128.txt|No production was achieved.
p284_129.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p284_130.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p284_131.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p284_132.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p284_133.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p284_134.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p284_135.txt|I don't know the full story.
p284_136.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p284_137.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p284_138.txt|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p284_139.txt|I was awful.
p284_140.txt|The idea is simple.
p284_141.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p284_142.txt|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p284_143.txt|It is not just about pay.
p284_144.txt|Note the date.
p284_145.txt|So I got a blood test.
p284_146.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p284_147.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p284_148.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p284_149.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p284_150.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p284_151.txt|I was on a roll.
p284_152.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p284_153.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p284_154.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p284_155.txt|He was asked to quit.
p284_156.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p284_157.txt|He can do no wrong.
p284_158.txt|Was this element always there?
p284_159.txt|These days are long gone.
p284_160.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p284_161.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p284_162.txt|They are not advertised.
p284_163.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p284_164.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p284_165.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p284_166.txt|They will do their own thing.
p284_167.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p284_168.txt|One season, they might do well.
p284_169.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p284_170.txt|As we worked.
p284_171.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p284_172.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p284_173.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p284_174.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p284_175.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p284_176.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p284_177.txt|I've been there.
p284_178.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p284_179.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p284_180.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p284_181.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p284_182.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p284_183.txt|Our team is just so young.
p284_184.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p284_185.txt|It is a farce.
p284_186.txt|Peace was won.
p284_187.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p284_188.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p284_189.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p284_190.txt|Is that success?
p284_191.txt|They are ready.
p284_192.txt|I have a cold.
p284_193.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p284_194.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p284_195.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p284_196.txt|There was no safety net.
p284_197.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p284_198.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p284_199.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p284_200.txt|There was an e-mail.
p284_201.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p284_202.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p284_203.txt|It had all been arranged.
p284_204.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p284_205.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p284_206.txt|It's not ideal.
p284_207.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p284_208.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p284_209.txt|I might come back.
p284_210.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p284_211.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p284_212.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p284_213.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p284_214.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p284_215.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p284_216.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p284_217.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p284_218.txt|It's not before time.
p284_219.txt|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p284_220.txt|The report is due out next month.
p284_221.txt|But she was.
p284_222.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p284_223.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p284_224.txt|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p284_225.txt|We were awful.
p284_226.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p284_227.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p284_228.txt|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p284_229.txt|There is no excuse.
p284_230.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p284_231.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p284_232.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p284_233.txt|The car was just there.
p284_234.txt|The whole thing will be great.
p284_235.txt|Our policy is clear.
p284_236.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p284_237.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p284_238.txt|The scene is about this?
p284_239.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p284_240.txt|It was a kind of contempt.
p284_241.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p284_242.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p284_243.txt|I should think so, too.
p284_244.txt|It was a hit.
p284_245.txt|There's the mix.
p284_246.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p284_247.txt|Is there on his hands?
p284_248.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p284_249.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p284_250.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p284_251.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p284_252.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p284_253.txt|We have to expand.
p284_254.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p284_255.txt|Is that a serious question?
p284_256.txt|They must play for each other.
p284_257.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p284_258.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p284_259.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p284_260.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p284_261.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p284_262.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p284_263.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p284_264.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p284_265.txt|The system can work.
p284_266.txt|We're in shock.
p284_267.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p284_268.txt|It's a way of life.
p284_269.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p284_270.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p284_271.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p284_272.txt|She looked so young.
p284_273.txt|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p284_274.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p284_275.txt|If not, he should go home.
p284_276.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p284_277.txt|We are a grandmother.
p284_278.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p284_279.txt|You feel very helpless.
p284_280.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p284_281.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p284_282.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p284_283.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p284_284.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p284_285.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p284_286.txt|This is a national crisis.
p284_287.txt|Bombing slaughter rejected
p284_288.txt|We are not going to forget.
p284_289.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p284_290.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p284_291.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p284_292.txt|The songs are just so good.
p284_293.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p284_294.txt|The goals will come.
p284_295.txt|Who can predict?
p284_296.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p284_297.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p284_298.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p284_299.txt|I was the sheep.
p284_300.txt|What has altered?
p284_301.txt|Nothing is safe.
p284_302.txt|One was a lawyer.
p284_303.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p284_304.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p284_305.txt|They are wrong.
p284_306.txt|I can live with it.
p284_307.txt|Work has started.
p284_308.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p284_309.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p284_310.txt|You should be.
p284_311.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p284_312.txt|The letters are going out today.
p284_313.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p284_314.txt|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p284_315.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p284_316.txt|Special measures were needed.
p284_317.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p284_318.txt|The show is at an end.
p284_319.txt|Your father was a good man.
p284_320.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p284_321.txt|We have got to get the points from this one.
p284_322.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p284_323.txt|Henman has been warned.
p284_324.txt|I would love it.
p284_325.txt|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p284_326.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p284_327.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p284_328.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p284_329.txt|We are in the end game.
p284_330.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p284_331.txt|There was no time scale.
p284_332.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p284_333.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p284_334.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p284_335.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p284_336.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p284_337.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p284_338.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p284_339.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p284_340.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p284_341.txt|He was the architect.
p284_342.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p284_343.txt|He has to learn.
p284_344.txt|Two people were interviewed.
p284_345.txt|I've got no secret.
p284_346.txt|This is a big advantage.
p284_347.txt|I'm very lucky.
p284_348.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p284_349.txt|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p284_350.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284_351.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p284_352.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p284_353.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p284_354.txt|I HAVE a dream.
p284_355.txt|We have big ideas.
p284_356.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p284_357.txt|I first met him last summer.
p284_358.txt|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p284_359.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p284_360.txt|She is free.
p284_361.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p284_362.txt|Yet he left a few days later.
p284_363.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p284_364.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p284_365.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p284_366.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p284_367.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p284_368.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p284_369.txt|Their time has gone.
p284_370.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p284_371.txt|They believed it worked.
p284_372.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p284_373.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p284_374.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p284_375.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p284_376.txt|It is a simple equation.
p284_377.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p284_378.txt|There is no signature.
p284_379.txt|The task is enormous.
p284_380.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p284_381.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p284_382.txt|It is hard to understand.
p284_383.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p284_384.txt|I was lost.
p284_385.txt|Something is wrong.
p284_386.txt|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p284_387.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p284_388.txt|It's like a car crash.
p284_389.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p284_390.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p284_391.txt|You had to go and see him.
p284_392.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p284_393.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p284_394.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p284_395.txt|We try to keep it right.
p284_396.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p284_397.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p284_398.txt|It can help.
p284_399.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p284_400.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p284_401.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p284_402.txt|But we are a young side.
p284_403.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p284_404.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p284_405.txt|It will take place in July.
p284_406.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p284_407.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p284_408.txt|It is full-scale.
p284_409.txt|Then , he laughs.
p284_410.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p284_411.txt|I knew the script.
p284_412.txt|It might be.
p284_413.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p284_414.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p284_415.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p284_416.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p284_417.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p284_418.txt|It is legally binding.
p284_419.txt|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p284_420.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p284_421.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p284_422.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p284_423.txt|It was little else.
p284_424.txt|He is to appeal.
p284_425.txt|Nato will prevail.
p285_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p285_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p285_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p285_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p285_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p285_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p285_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p285_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p285_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p285_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p285_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p285_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p285_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p285_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p285_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p285_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p285_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p285_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p285_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p285_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p285_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p285_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p285_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p285_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p285_025.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p285_026.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p285_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p285_028.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p285_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p285_030.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p285_031.txt|There's a story, too.
p285_032.txt|This is the window.
p285_033.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p285_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p285_035.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p285_036.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p285_037.txt|They're just different.
p285_038.txt|It was clear.
p285_039.txt|Indeed, he does.
p285_040.txt|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p285_041.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p285_042.txt|Sure, it's funny.
p285_043.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p285_044.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p285_045.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p285_046.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p285_047.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p285_048.txt|Here's a clue.
p285_049.txt|I was lost.
p285_050.txt|It's a miracle.
p285_051.txt|I love the Dome.
p285_052.txt|There was no safety net.
p285_053.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p285_054.txt|That's the truth.
p285_055.txt|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p285_056.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p285_057.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p285_058.txt|It's that kind of place.
p285_059.txt|They are real.
p285_060.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p285_061.txt|We should have known.
p285_062.txt|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p285_063.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p285_064.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p285_065.txt|There could be a way back.
p285_066.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p285_067.txt|I had my suspicions.
p285_068.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p285_069.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p285_070.txt|Even the one she loved.
p285_071.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p285_072.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p285_073.txt|What has changed?
p285_074.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p285_075.txt|He is in the queue.
p285_076.txt|He is driven.
p285_077.txt|All options are open.
p285_078.txt|I was too young.
p285_079.txt|Someone who cares
p285_080.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p285_081.txt|It is a blow.
p285_082.txt|They lived for their children.
p285_083.txt|It will be tight.
p285_084.txt|This is the start of our season.
p285_085.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p285_086.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p285_087.txt|We knew they could do it.
p285_088.txt|But I was wrong.
p285_089.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p285_090.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p285_091.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p285_092.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p285_093.txt|It was mayhem.
p285_094.txt|Journalists should make him.
p285_095.txt|It is a love affair.
p285_096.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p285_097.txt|They tried to deny it.
p285_098.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p285_099.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p285_100.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p285_101.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p285_102.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p285_103.txt|She reflects a bit.
p285_104.txt|It was an interesting thing to do.
p285_105.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p285_106.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p285_107.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p285_108.txt|Is that right?
p285_109.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p285_110.txt|It was the eighties.
p285_111.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p285_112.txt|It is so sad.
p285_113.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p285_114.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p285_115.txt|It is rubbish.
p285_116.txt|Who would be a referee?
p285_117.txt|We enjoyed it today.
p285_118.txt|She does not want to speak.
p285_119.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p285_120.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p285_121.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p285_122.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p285_123.txt|It is not a U-turn.
p285_124.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p285_125.txt|No production was achieved.
p285_126.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p285_127.txt|I am now unemployed.
p285_128.txt|We work well together.
p285_129.txt|It's not true.
p285_130.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p285_131.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p285_132.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p285_133.txt|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p285_134.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p285_135.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p285_136.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p285_137.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p285_138.txt|Who would be right?
p285_139.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p285_140.txt|I was awful.
p285_141.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p285_142.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p285_143.txt|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p285_144.txt|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p285_145.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p285_146.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p285_147.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p285_148.txt|I was on a roll.
p285_149.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p285_150.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p285_151.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p285_152.txt|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p285_153.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p285_154.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p285_155.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p285_156.txt|That includes the equipment?
p285_157.txt|Well, he should know.
p285_158.txt|I will tell you.
p285_159.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p285_160.txt|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p285_161.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p285_162.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p285_163.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p285_164.txt|They are not advertised.
p285_165.txt|Tell it like it was?
p285_166.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p285_167.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p285_168.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p285_169.txt|I carried on for him.
p285_170.txt|He was a crazy man.
p285_171.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p285_172.txt|One season, they might do well.
p285_173.txt|As we worked.
p285_174.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p285_175.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p285_176.txt|My players are special.
p285_177.txt|I drove the ball well.
p285_178.txt|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p285_179.txt|The goals were good.
p285_180.txt|His name was unknown.
p285_181.txt|Nothing is safe.
p285_182.txt|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p285_183.txt|Many innocent people will die.
p285_184.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p285_185.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p285_186.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p285_187.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p285_188.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p285_189.txt|There is no openness.
p285_190.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p285_191.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p285_192.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p285_193.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p285_194.txt|It's a fact.
p285_195.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p285_196.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p285_197.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p285_198.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p285_199.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p285_200.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p285_201.txt|Today was first class.
p285_202.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p285_203.txt|I don't want to use it.
p285_204.txt|There was an e-mail.
p285_205.txt|He knows a lot.
p285_206.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p285_207.txt|It's not before time.
p285_208.txt|It's not ideal.
p285_209.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p285_210.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p285_211.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p285_212.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p285_213.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p285_214.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p285_215.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p285_216.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p285_217.txt|That has been the easy part.
p285_218.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p285_219.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p285_220.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p285_221.txt|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p285_222.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p285_223.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p285_224.txt|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p285_225.txt|But she was.
p285_226.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p285_227.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p285_228.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p285_229.txt|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p285_230.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p285_231.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p285_232.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p285_233.txt|Wealth is relative.
p285_234.txt|You should be.
p285_235.txt|It's quite nice.
p285_236.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p285_237.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p285_238.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p285_239.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p285_240.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p285_241.txt|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p285_242.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p285_243.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p285_244.txt|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285_245.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p285_246.txt|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p285_247.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p285_248.txt|It was a hit.
p285_249.txt|There's the mix.
p285_250.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p285_251.txt|The concerns are the same.
p285_252.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p285_253.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p285_254.txt|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p285_255.txt|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p285_256.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p285_257.txt|Is that a serious question?
p285_258.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p285_259.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p285_260.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p285_261.txt|Souter will be back.
p285_262.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p285_263.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p285_264.txt|He was also married with two children.
p285_265.txt|The system can work.
p285_266.txt|We are happy.
p285_267.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p285_268.txt|We're in shock.
p285_269.txt|Of course I was tempted.
p285_270.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p285_271.txt|It was very fast.
p285_272.txt|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p285_273.txt|They seem to get away with it.
p285_274.txt|I feel pretty good.
p285_275.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p285_276.txt|She looked so young.
p285_277.txt|It's so awful.
p285_278.txt|He looked very sharp.
p285_279.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p285_280.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285_281.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p285_282.txt|Yet, it worked.
p285_283.txt|Who will perform?
p285_284.txt|It was good.
p285_285.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p285_286.txt|We are not going to forget.
p285_287.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p285_288.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285_289.txt|Who can predict?
p285_290.txt|There was a vacuum.
p285_291.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p285_292.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p285_293.txt|What has altered?
p285_294.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p285_295.txt|She is really magic.
p285_296.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p285_297.txt|One was a lawyer.
p285_298.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p285_299.txt|They are wrong.
p285_300.txt|It could work.
p285_301.txt|This is a war over our home.
p285_302.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p285_303.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p285_304.txt|It needs a team approach.
p285_305.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p285_306.txt|There is no excuse.
p285_307.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p285_308.txt|The letters are going out today.
p285_309.txt|She is very distinctive.
p285_310.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p285_311.txt|Hartley should know.
p285_312.txt|Henman has been warned.
p285_313.txt|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p285_314.txt|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p285_315.txt|A review is under way.
p285_316.txt|It will work.
p285_317.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p285_318.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p285_319.txt|Off with their heads.
p285_320.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p285_321.txt|There was no time scale.
p285_322.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p285_323.txt|Either team will be hard.
p285_324.txt|It's not long enough.
p285_325.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p285_326.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p285_327.txt|The party is up for it.
p285_328.txt|The outcome is not in doubt.
p285_329.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p285_330.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p285_331.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p285_332.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p285_333.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p285_334.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p285_335.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p285_336.txt|I've got no secret.
p285_337.txt|went on sale.
p285_338.txt|I'm very lucky.
p285_339.txt|Our policy is clear.
p285_340.txt|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p285_341.txt|I will miss him.
p285_342.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p285_343.txt|I got a yellow card.
p285_344.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p285_345.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p285_346.txt|I HAVE a dream.
p285_347.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p285_348.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p285_349.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p285_350.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p285_351.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p285_352.txt|The pair are very much in love.

p285_354.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285_355.txt|We will be homeless.
p285_356.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p285_357.txt|It is a memorial.
p285_358.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p285_359.txt|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p285_360.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p285_361.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p285_362.txt|They believed it worked.
p285_363.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p285_364.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p285_365.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p285_366.txt|It seems a long time ago.
p285_367.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p285_368.txt|So there, we won.
p285_369.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p285_370.txt|There is no signature.
p285_371.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p285_372.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p285_373.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p285_374.txt|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p285_375.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p285_376.txt|Something is wrong.
p285_377.txt|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p285_378.txt|You can cope with it.
p285_379.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p285_380.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p285_381.txt|It is the old story.
p285_382.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p285_383.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p285_384.txt|It's just outrageous.
p285_385.txt|They deserved the win.
p285_386.txt|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p285_387.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p285_388.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p285_389.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p285_390.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p285_391.txt|They are good.
p285_392.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p285_393.txt|But we are a young side.
p285_394.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p285_395.txt|It will take place in July.
p285_396.txt|What happened in the summer?
p285_397.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p285_398.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p285_399.txt|Is that possible?
p285_400.txt|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p285_401.txt|What was the difference between them?
p285_402.txt|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285_403.txt|Emotions were complex.
p286_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p286_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p286_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p286_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p286_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p286_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p286_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p286_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p286_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p286_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p286_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p286_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p286_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p286_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p286_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p286_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p286_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p286_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p286_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p286_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p286_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p286_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p286_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p286_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p286_025.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p286_026.txt|We must convince the citizens.
p286_027.txt|I am pretty careful with money.
p286_028.txt|Because we do not need it.
p286_029.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p286_030.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p286_031.txt|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p286_032.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p286_033.txt|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p286_034.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p286_035.txt|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p286_036.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p286_037.txt|Costs have got to be controlled.
p286_038.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p286_039.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p286_040.txt|It is serious - but not that serious.
p286_041.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p286_042.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p286_043.txt|He will need that machine.
p286_044.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p286_045.txt|I had come back from London.
p286_046.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p286_047.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p286_048.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p286_049.txt|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p286_050.txt|We are a new department.
p286_051.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p286_052.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p286_053.txt|How are you, sir ?
p286_054.txt|So is that it, then ?
p286_055.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p286_056.txt|People come to see the Highlands.
p286_057.txt|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p286_058.txt|We have not given up hope.
p286_059.txt|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p286_060.txt|We would have concerns about suspension.
p286_061.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p286_062.txt|We have to keep our clients.
p286_063.txt|It seems to have worked.
p286_064.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p286_065.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p286_066.txt|It is a great feeling right now.
p286_067.txt|It's not covered by the insurance.
p286_068.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p286_069.txt|It wasn't possible to relax.
p286_070.txt|We speak about the performance.
p286_071.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p286_072.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p286_073.txt|That would be too easy.
p286_074.txt|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p286_075.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p286_076.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p286_077.txt|Even the one she loved.
p286_078.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p286_079.txt|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p286_080.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p286_081.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p286_082.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p286_083.txt|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p286_084.txt|He has been a success this year.
p286_085.txt|The error appeared in a warrant.
p286_086.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p286_087.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p286_088.txt|It's so hard to shift.
p286_089.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p286_090.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p286_091.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p286_092.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p286_093.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p286_094.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p286_095.txt|And does it ?
p286_096.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p286_097.txt|Had I heard ?
p286_098.txt|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p286_099.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p286_100.txt|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p286_101.txt|It really was an unusual award.
p286_102.txt|I cannot believe this decision.
p286_103.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p286_104.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p286_105.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p286_106.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p286_107.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p286_108.txt|We could not get any possession.
p286_109.txt|They must be on commission.
p286_110.txt|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p286_111.txt|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p286_112.txt|He was forced to quit.
p286_113.txt|But I know the course.
p286_114.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p286_115.txt|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p286_116.txt|In the end we made too many errors.
p286_117.txt|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p286_118.txt|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p286_119.txt|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p286_120.txt|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p286_121.txt|It is an impressive record.
p286_122.txt|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p286_123.txt|I have learned from him.
p286_124.txt|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p286_125.txt|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p286_126.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p286_127.txt|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p286_128.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p286_129.txt|The firm also has a construction division.
p286_130.txt|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p286_131.txt|Then again, we could have.
p286_132.txt|They will remember this victory for a while.
p286_133.txt|Structural changes were also required.
p286_134.txt|It was a good game to watch.
p286_135.txt|His job was not advertised.
p286_136.txt|However, the problem is the timing.
p286_137.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p286_138.txt|Which can happen any time.
p286_139.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p286_140.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p286_141.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p286_142.txt|He said to give a local injection.
p286_143.txt|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p286_144.txt|The first half was depressing.
p286_145.txt|Tiger is not the norm.
p286_146.txt|He will get his chances.
p286_147.txt|They could use a boost.
p286_148.txt|What happened in that game ?
p286_149.txt|Are you going to win ?
p286_150.txt|Was it the wife ?
p286_151.txt|Why change it ?
p286_152.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p286_153.txt|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p286_154.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p286_155.txt|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p286_156.txt|He's not a Celtic man.
p286_157.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p286_158.txt|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p286_159.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p286_160.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p286_161.txt|Behind him was his brother.
p286_162.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p286_163.txt|The family kept away from me.
p286_164.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p286_165.txt|We will turn the corner.
p286_166.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p286_167.txt|It should never have happened.
p286_168.txt|We did what we had to do.
p286_169.txt|The bank was now involved.
p286_170.txt|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p286_171.txt|It's never great to finish second.
p286_172.txt|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p286_173.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p286_174.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p286_175.txt|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p286_176.txt|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p286_177.txt|They could not match it.
p286_178.txt|One season, they might do well.
p286_179.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p286_180.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p286_181.txt|People should not become complacent.
p286_182.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p286_183.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p286_184.txt|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p286_185.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p286_186.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p286_187.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p286_188.txt|We have a long way to go this week.
p286_189.txt|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p286_190.txt|His son is a local legend.
p286_191.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p286_192.txt|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
p286_193.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p286_194.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p286_195.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p286_196.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p286_197.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p286_198.txt|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
p286_199.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p286_200.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p286_201.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p286_202.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p286_203.txt|Does the name matter ?
p286_204.txt|how do you get it back ?
p286_205.txt|What are you not good at ?
p286_206.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p286_207.txt|Who was she ?
p286_208.txt|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p286_209.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p286_210.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p286_211.txt|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p286_212.txt|Because he was born in England.
p286_213.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p286_214.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p286_215.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p286_216.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p286_217.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p286_218.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p286_219.txt|We should all be grateful.
p286_220.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p286_221.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p286_222.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p286_223.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p286_224.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p286_225.txt|This will take several weeks.
p286_226.txt|Scotland will play its part.
p286_227.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p286_228.txt|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p286_229.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p286_230.txt|His injury was completely random.
p286_231.txt|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p286_232.txt|It will affect their work.
p286_233.txt|These things have not happened by accident.
p286_234.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p286_235.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p286_236.txt|He must get to know himself.
p286_237.txt|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p286_238.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p286_239.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p286_240.txt|You could feel the heat.
p286_241.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p286_242.txt|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p286_243.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p286_244.txt|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p286_245.txt|The scientific debate is dead.
p286_246.txt|This would include the GM food industry.
p286_247.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p286_248.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p286_249.txt|She will attend in July.
p286_250.txt|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p286_251.txt|She claimed the day was for young people.
p286_252.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p286_253.txt|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p286_254.txt|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p286_255.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p286_256.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p286_257.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p286_258.txt|There were no reports of casualties.
p286_259.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p286_260.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p286_261.txt|And it was this one.
p286_262.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p286_263.txt|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p286_264.txt|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p286_265.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p286_266.txt|His is a global perspective.
p286_267.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p286_268.txt|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p286_269.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p286_270.txt|I should think so, too.
p286_271.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p286_272.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p286_273.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p286_274.txt|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p286_275.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p286_276.txt|And they were being paid ?
p286_277.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p286_278.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p286_279.txt|Do I think about them often ?

p286_339.txt|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p286_340.txt|I didn't have the reply.

p286_360.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p286_361.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p286_362.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p286_363.txt|We have very limited capacity.
p286_364.txt|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p286_365.txt|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.

p286_373.txt|Neither woman has been named.

p286_376.txt|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p286_377.txt|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p286_378.txt|Finally came the moment of truth.
p286_379.txt|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p286_380.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p286_381.txt|She is obviously very disappointed.
p286_382.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p286_383.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p286_384.txt|The team hadn't been picked.

p286_390.txt|Rugby has an extended run.
p286_391.txt|Is it worth it ?
p286_392.txt|Does it matter ?
p286_393.txt|How do you take them away ?
p286_394.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p286_395.txt|After the match, do you ?
p286_396.txt|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p286_397.txt|It gets into the culture.
p286_398.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p286_399.txt|In fact, he was great today.
p286_400.txt|A review is under way.
p286_401.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p286_402.txt|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p286_403.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p286_404.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p286_405.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p286_406.txt|The choice is strictly personal.
p286_407.txt|It's too close to call.
p286_408.txt|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p286_409.txt|They were a lovely family.
p286_410.txt|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.

p286_413.txt|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p286_414.txt|It's just a training thing.
p286_415.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p286_416.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p286_417.txt|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p286_418.txt|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p286_419.txt|It had been on the cards.
p286_420.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p286_421.txt|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p286_422.txt|That was a touch of class.
p286_423.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p286_424.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p286_425.txt|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p286_426.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p286_427.txt|No date has been fixed for his return.
p286_428.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p286_429.txt|I never had a childhood.
p286_430.txt|Nobody should believe this story.
p286_431.txt|It's going to be epic.
p286_432.txt|They did the right thing.
p286_433.txt|There is another important factor.
p286_434.txt|The growth potential is enormous.
p286_435.txt|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p286_436.txt|But he gave no details.
p286_437.txt|That was a great performance by the team.
p286_438.txt|Which may be the same thing.
p286_439.txt|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p286_440.txt|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p286_441.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p286_442.txt|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p286_443.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p286_444.txt|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p286_445.txt|There were no formal announcements.
p286_446.txt|He had no problems with discipline.
p286_447.txt|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p286_448.txt|The couple had one daughter.
p286_449.txt|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
p286_450.txt|We make this offer to the parliament.
p286_451.txt|The jury is still out.
p286_452.txt|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p286_453.txt|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p286_454.txt|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p286_455.txt|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p286_456.txt|They were good years for him.
p286_457.txt|It was his job to check.
p286_458.txt|The boys are mentally focused.
p286_459.txt|The damage has been done.
p286_460.txt|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p286_461.txt|They are defined by law.
p286_462.txt|The peace process will be buried!
p286_463.txt|We are now up against it.
p286_464.txt|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p286_465.txt|It is vital to clarify their role.
p286_466.txt|He was backed by Downing Street.
p286_467.txt|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
p286_468.txt|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p287_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p287_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p287_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p287_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p287_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p287_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p287_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p287_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p287_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p287_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p287_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p287_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p287_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p287_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p287_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p287_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p287_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p287_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p287_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p287_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p287_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p287_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p287_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p287_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p287_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p287_026.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p287_027.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p287_028.txt|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p287_029.txt|He has the courage of the unaware.
p287_030.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p287_031.txt|This is a central issue.
p287_032.txt|But a solution has been found.
p287_033.txt|I thought it was an accident.
p287_034.txt|President Bush is at war.
p287_035.txt|That period was a struggle.
p287_036.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p287_037.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p287_038.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p287_039.txt|But it might have done.
p287_040.txt|There is no reason at all.
p287_041.txt|This will get their attention.
p287_042.txt|Must be prepared to use it.
p287_043.txt|He will need that machine.
p287_044.txt|I had come back from London.
p287_045.txt|I saw them last week.
p287_046.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p287_047.txt|There was no safety net.
p287_048.txt|The teacher would have approved.
p287_049.txt|It is quite a figure.
p287_050.txt|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p287_051.txt|It depends on the couple.
p287_052.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p287_053.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p287_054.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p287_055.txt|You do not change overnight.
p287_056.txt|We will pay their bills.
p287_057.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p287_058.txt|How are you, sir ?
p287_059.txt|So is that it, then ?
p287_060.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p287_061.txt|What do we do ?
p287_062.txt|It has been an amazing day.
p287_063.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p287_064.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287_065.txt|This is a big step up.
p287_066.txt|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p287_067.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p287_068.txt|Now the plot is perfect.
p287_069.txt|That would be too easy.
p287_070.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p287_071.txt|It looks like a hit.
p287_072.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287_073.txt|I first met him last summer.
p287_074.txt|We did it for the jersey.
p287_075.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p287_076.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p287_077.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287_078.txt|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287_079.txt|That was a great performance by the team.
p287_080.txt|It was a total disaster.
p287_081.txt|I've never seen anything like it.
p287_082.txt|He added that he felt undermined.
p287_083.txt|It was not an insult.
p287_084.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p287_085.txt|It was clear on Thursday.
p287_086.txt|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p287_087.txt|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p287_088.txt|But I know the course.
p287_089.txt|We intend to change the model.
p287_090.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p287_091.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p287_092.txt|This decision is a farce.
p287_093.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p287_094.txt|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p287_095.txt|It would be the end of farming.
p287_096.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p287_097.txt|It's not a lack of confidence.
p287_098.txt|We have got a race.
p287_099.txt|He will go on the bench.
p287_100.txt|You had better believe it.
p287_101.txt|New Year will be very busy.
p287_102.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p287_103.txt|That was the first step.
p287_104.txt|I was impressed with them.
p287_105.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p287_106.txt|Mr Blair should be warned.
p287_107.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p287_108.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p287_109.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p287_110.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p287_111.txt|And does it ?
p287_112.txt|Then again, we could have.
p287_113.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p287_114.txt|We have a training class.
p287_115.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p287_116.txt|We did what we had to do.
p287_117.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p287_118.txt|She was also very brave.
p287_119.txt|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p287_120.txt|You are a gambling man.
p287_121.txt|My conscience is not clear.
p287_122.txt|He is a great addition to our team.
p287_123.txt|I felt he was excellent.
p287_124.txt|We will try to find someone.
p287_125.txt|The money needs to go to the front line.
p287_126.txt|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p287_127.txt|I miss the freedom that I had.
p287_128.txt|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p287_129.txt|We had to add value.
p287_130.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p287_131.txt|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p287_132.txt|That is the real test.
p287_133.txt|I would relish the prospect.
p287_134.txt|It has become a way of life.
p287_135.txt|We will provide immediate access.
p287_136.txt|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p287_137.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p287_138.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p287_139.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p287_140.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p287_141.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p287_142.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p287_143.txt|We will turn the corner.
p287_144.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p287_145.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p287_146.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p287_147.txt|These days are long gone.
p287_148.txt|I am a good player.
p287_149.txt|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
p287_150.txt|We have a budget in March.
p287_151.txt|The pension levels will remain the same.
p287_152.txt|You had to go and see him.
p287_153.txt|They could not match it.
p287_154.txt|The people are the hero.
p287_155.txt|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p287_156.txt|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287_157.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p287_158.txt|This much I can tell you.
p287_159.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p287_160.txt|Phase one was a shambles.
p287_161.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p287_162.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p287_163.txt|Tomorrow is a new day.
p287_164.txt|What happened in that game ?
p287_165.txt|Are you going to win ?
p287_166.txt|Was it the wife ?
p287_167.txt|Why change it ?
p287_168.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p287_169.txt|His son is a local legend.
p287_170.txt|I am not ready to walk away.
p287_171.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p287_172.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p287_173.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p287_174.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p287_175.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p287_176.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p287_177.txt|People like to talk about these things.
p287_178.txt|Being investor ready is a good start.
p287_179.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p287_180.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p287_181.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p287_182.txt|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p287_183.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p287_184.txt|They were seriously after him.
p287_185.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p287_186.txt|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p287_187.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p287_188.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p287_189.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p287_190.txt|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p287_191.txt|It is hard to tell.
p287_192.txt|I can't play the game for them.
p287_193.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p287_194.txt|They might be surprised by the response.
p287_195.txt|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p287_196.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p287_197.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p287_198.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p287_199.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p287_200.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p287_201.txt|Getting this right is essential.
p287_202.txt|Does the name matter ?
p287_203.txt|how do you get it back ?
p287_204.txt|What are you not good at ?
p287_205.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p287_206.txt|Who was she ?
p287_207.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p287_208.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p287_209.txt|I had relied on him.
p287_210.txt|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p287_211.txt|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p287_212.txt|It had all been arranged.
p287_213.txt|His third goal was superb.
p287_214.txt|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p287_215.txt|His second was a beauty.
p287_216.txt|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p287_217.txt|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p287_218.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p287_219.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p287_220.txt|The red card was okay.
p287_221.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p287_222.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p287_223.txt|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p287_224.txt|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p287_225.txt|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p287_226.txt|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p287_227.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p287_228.txt|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p287_229.txt|She died in middle age.
p287_230.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p287_231.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p287_232.txt|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p287_233.txt|This is a family club.
p287_234.txt|They need to win a trophy.
p287_235.txt|I was ready for this.
p287_236.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p287_237.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p287_238.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p287_239.txt|The effects are not all bad.
p287_240.txt|He would not impose a fine.
p287_241.txt|It was a fairy tale.
p287_242.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p287_243.txt|She took them for a term.
p287_244.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p287_245.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p287_246.txt|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p287_247.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p287_248.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p287_249.txt|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p287_250.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p287_251.txt|I should think so, too.
p287_252.txt|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p287_253.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p287_254.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p287_255.txt|That you can do it.
p287_256.txt|He was on a horse.
p287_257.txt|The concerns are the same.
p287_258.txt|We are in a war.
p287_259.txt|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p287_260.txt|We run within the law.
p287_261.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p287_262.txt|They are very keen to work with us.
p287_263.txt|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p287_264.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p287_265.txt|They must play for each other.
p287_266.txt|It is also very valuable.
p287_267.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p287_268.txt|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p287_269.txt|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p287_270.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p287_271.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p287_272.txt|And they were being paid ?
p287_273.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p287_274.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p287_275.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p287_276.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p287_277.txt|Did he trip ?
p287_278.txt|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p287_279.txt|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p287_280.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p287_281.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p287_282.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p287_283.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p287_284.txt|And Michael was just great.
p287_285.txt|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p287_286.txt|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p287_287.txt|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p287_288.txt|It was never a free kick.
p287_289.txt|She failed in her action.
p287_290.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p287_291.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p287_292.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p287_293.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p287_294.txt|If not, he should go home.
p287_295.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p287_296.txt|Size is not the issue.
p287_297.txt|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p287_298.txt|But it is up again.
p287_299.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p287_300.txt|Either team will be hard.
p287_301.txt|That is the general feeling.
p287_302.txt|It has to be an event.
p287_303.txt|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p287_304.txt|We can work all night.
p287_305.txt|The answer is with ourselves.
p287_306.txt|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
p287_307.txt|There is no evidence for that.
p287_308.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p287_309.txt|Nothing has been put into action.
p287_310.txt|You are a different people.
p287_311.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p287_312.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p287_313.txt|They are not left wing.
p287_314.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p287_315.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p287_316.txt|The City welcomed the numbers.
p287_317.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p287_318.txt|This is a war over our home.
p287_319.txt|We have a good healthy debate.
p287_320.txt|And he goes with it.
p287_321.txt|I have signed a contract.
p287_322.txt|It is a court case.
p287_323.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p287_324.txt|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p287_325.txt|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p287_326.txt|After some discussion they did.
p287_327.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p287_328.txt|It wasn't a good day for us.
p287_329.txt|The show is at an end.
p287_330.txt|What form did that take ?
p287_331.txt|Are they free ?
p287_332.txt|What are they for ?
p287_333.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p287_334.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p287_335.txt|So what happens next ?
p287_336.txt|It was an achievement all right.
p287_337.txt|My whole life has changed.
p287_338.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p287_339.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p287_340.txt|You may have a short memory.
p287_341.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p287_342.txt|A Home Office spokesman said.
p287_343.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p287_344.txt|I think it's about time.
p287_345.txt|The airport was even different.
p287_346.txt|Other people had looked at it.
p287_347.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p287_348.txt|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p287_349.txt|It is a strong case.
p287_350.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p287_351.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p287_352.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p287_353.txt|It's wonderful to have won.
p287_354.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p287_355.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p287_356.txt|Appointments should be made on merit.
p287_357.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p287_358.txt|Even the one she loved.
p287_359.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p287_360.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p287_361.txt|They were the acts of men.
p287_362.txt|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p287_363.txt|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p287_364.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p287_365.txt|He did a good job.
p287_366.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p287_367.txt|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p287_368.txt|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p287_369.txt|It is a stroke of genius.
p287_370.txt|The members have voted against it.
p287_371.txt|We knew he was very creative.
p287_372.txt|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p287_373.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p287_374.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p287_375.txt|SE is well down that road.
p287_376.txt|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287_377.txt|There is a cup final at stake.
p287_378.txt|It's only a matter of scale.
p287_379.txt|I do not like to lose.
p287_380.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p287_381.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p287_382.txt|This remains the party's policy.
p287_383.txt|They will fight for everything.
p287_384.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p287_385.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p287_386.txt|It was like a vacuum.
p287_387.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p287_388.txt|My dad is all right.
p287_389.txt|It gets into the culture.
p287_390.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p287_391.txt|But we are very near.
p287_392.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p287_393.txt|It has only been rumours.
p287_394.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p287_395.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p287_396.txt|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p287_397.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p287_398.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p287_399.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p287_400.txt|Is it worth it ?
p287_401.txt|Does it matter ?
p287_402.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p287_403.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p287_404.txt|No, because it was too many.
p287_405.txt|It's too close to call.
p287_406.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p287_407.txt|I decided to take my time.
p287_408.txt|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p287_409.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p287_410.txt|That is the ultimate revenge.
p287_411.txt|It certainly appeared that way.
p287_412.txt|They are looking for profit.
p287_413.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p287_414.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p287_415.txt|I am astonished at attack.
p287_416.txt|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p287_417.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p287_418.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p287_419.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p287_420.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p287_421.txt|That's been all around Europe with me.
p287_422.txt|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p287_423.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p287_424.txt|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p288_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p288_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p288_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p288_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p288_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p288_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p288_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p288_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p288_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p288_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p288_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p288_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p288_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p288_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p288_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p288_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p288_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p288_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p288_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p288_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p288_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p288_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p288_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p288_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p288_025.txt|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p288_026.txt|It is a disaster area.
p288_027.txt|Is this accurate?
p288_028.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p288_029.txt|Because we do not need it.
p288_030.txt|I was an athlete.
p288_031.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p288_032.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p288_033.txt|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p288_034.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p288_035.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p288_036.txt|President Bush is at war.
p288_037.txt|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p288_038.txt|I was scared.
p288_039.txt|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p288_040.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p288_041.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p288_042.txt|We need to chat.
p288_043.txt|But it might have done.
p288_044.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p288_045.txt|He is too weak to move.
p288_046.txt|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288_047.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288_048.txt|It will come all right.
p288_049.txt|I was lost.
p288_050.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p288_051.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p288_052.txt|Sadly, it can't.
p288_053.txt|It's very odd.
p288_054.txt|It is unique.
p288_055.txt|It will take time.
p288_056.txt|That's the truth.
p288_057.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p288_058.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288_059.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p288_060.txt|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288_061.txt|They're appalled by that.
p288_062.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p288_063.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p288_064.txt|We should have known.
p288_065.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p288_066.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p288_067.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p288_068.txt|That was the easy election.
p288_069.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p288_070.txt|Neither it is.
p288_071.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p288_072.txt|It can be halted.
p288_073.txt|It was chaotic.
p288_074.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p288_075.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288_076.txt|I've not thought about it.
p288_077.txt|People must remain vigilant.
p288_078.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p288_079.txt|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288_080.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p288_081.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p288_082.txt|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p288_083.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p288_084.txt|We have other options.
p288_085.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p288_086.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p288_087.txt|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p288_088.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p288_089.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p288_090.txt|It is a lifeline.
p288_091.txt|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p288_092.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p288_093.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288_094.txt|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p288_095.txt|Journalists should make him.
p288_096.txt|It was a good performance.
p288_097.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p288_098.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p288_099.txt|It was an adventure.
p288_100.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p288_101.txt|I'm not depressed.
p288_102.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p288_103.txt|It's in his blood.
p288_104.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p288_105.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p288_106.txt|It is so sad.
p288_107.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p288_108.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p288_109.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288_110.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p288_111.txt|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288_112.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p288_113.txt|It is rubbish.
p288_114.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p288_115.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p288_116.txt|That's all right then.
p288_117.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p288_118.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p288_119.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p288_120.txt|I'm so angry.
p288_121.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p288_122.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p288_123.txt|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p288_124.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p288_125.txt|I had relied on him.
p288_126.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p288_127.txt|The goals were good.
p288_128.txt|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p288_129.txt|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p288_130.txt|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p288_131.txt|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p288_132.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p288_133.txt|Is that Titanic?
p288_134.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.

p288_140.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.

p288_146.txt|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p288_147.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p288_148.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p288_149.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p288_150.txt|It was so new, so exciting.
p288_151.txt|I'm just enjoying every match.
p288_152.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.

p288_158.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p288_159.txt|They will do their own thing.
p288_160.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p288_161.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p288_162.txt|It is too much for me.
p288_163.txt|It is a terrible place.
p288_164.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p288_165.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p288_166.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p288_167.txt|He was a crazy man.
p288_168.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p288_169.txt|The jury is still out.
p288_170.txt|It's quite a routine.
p288_171.txt|It should be easy.
p288_172.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p288_173.txt|Tony had arrived.

p288_178.txt|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p288_179.txt|It's a joke.
p288_180.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p288_181.txt|They really did a great job.
p288_182.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p288_183.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p288_184.txt|People will ask about us.
p288_185.txt|If the director is with you.
p288_186.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p288_187.txt|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p288_188.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.

p288_193.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p288_194.txt|The conference is the first test.
p288_195.txt|Is that success?
p288_196.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p288_197.txt|They are in the euro.
p288_198.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p288_199.txt|But she might be.
p288_200.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p288_201.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p288_202.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p288_203.txt|Now, it's all right.
p288_204.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.

p288_206.txt|Feel the heat?
p288_207.txt|She should not be blamed.
p288_208.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p288_209.txt|It had all been arranged.
p288_210.txt|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p288_211.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p288_212.txt|I was so nervous.
p288_213.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p288_214.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p288_215.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p288_216.txt|Who was on the panel?

p288_218.txt|We've got the bronze.
p288_219.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p288_220.txt|You have to do your research.
p288_221.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p288_222.txt|But it will be sorted out this week.
p288_223.txt|It was good fun.
p288_224.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p288_225.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p288_226.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p288_227.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p288_228.txt|The body follows the mind.
p288_229.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p288_230.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p288_231.txt|It is set in Paris.
p288_232.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p288_233.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p288_234.txt|And a film maker was born.
p288_235.txt|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p288_236.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p288_237.txt|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p288_238.txt|He's got to go.
p288_239.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p288_240.txt|It's too much work.
p288_241.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p288_242.txt|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p288_243.txt|It is hard won.
p288_244.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p288_245.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p288_246.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p288_247.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p288_248.txt|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.

p288_250.txt|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p288_251.txt|I told you I was ill.
p288_252.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p288_253.txt|This is a big club.
p288_254.txt|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p288_255.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p288_256.txt|I was happily surprised.
p288_257.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.

p288_261.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p288_262.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p288_263.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p288_264.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p288_265.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p288_266.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p288_267.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p288_268.txt|And Michael was just great.
p288_269.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p288_270.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p288_271.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p288_272.txt|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p288_273.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p288_274.txt|I am an estate agent.
p288_275.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p288_276.txt|It happens from time to time.
p288_277.txt|But I've won both ways.
p288_278.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p288_279.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p288_280.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p288_281.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p288_282.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p288_283.txt|Who will perform?
p288_284.txt|It's like a high school play.
p288_285.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p288_286.txt|This is a national crisis.
p288_287.txt|The death toll included five children.
p288_288.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p288_289.txt|So I did.
p288_290.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p288_291.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p288_292.txt|Who can predict?
p288_293.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p288_294.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p288_295.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p288_296.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p288_297.txt|The home was now under new management.
p288_298.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p288_299.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p288_300.txt|Nothing is safe.
p288_301.txt|One was a lawyer.
p288_302.txt|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p288_303.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p288_304.txt|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p288_305.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p288_306.txt|It's just not funny!
p288_307.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p288_308.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p288_309.txt|It's certainly different.
p288_310.txt|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p288_311.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p288_312.txt|He was solid.
p288_313.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p288_314.txt|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p288_315.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p288_316.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p288_317.txt|My whole life has changed.
p288_318.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p288_319.txt|Hartley should know.
p288_320.txt|Kids are terrible.
p288_321.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p288_322.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p288_323.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p288_324.txt|I had my suspicions.
p288_325.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p288_326.txt|There was some merit in that.
p288_327.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p288_328.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p288_329.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p288_330.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p288_331.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p288_332.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p288_333.txt|Donald was his friend.
p288_334.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p288_335.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p288_336.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p288_337.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p288_338.txt|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p288_339.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p288_340.txt|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p288_341.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p288_342.txt|These days are long gone.
p288_343.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p288_344.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p288_345.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p288_346.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p288_347.txt|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p288_348.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p288_349.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p288_350.txt|That has been lost.
p288_351.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p288_352.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p288_353.txt|It's good to start with Judith.
p288_354.txt|There is no room for error.
p288_355.txt|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p288_356.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p288_357.txt|He's very explosive.
p288_358.txt|We have to move forward.
p288_359.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p288_360.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p288_361.txt|Our numbers are small.
p288_362.txt|That would help.
p288_363.txt|So I left.
p288_364.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p288_365.txt|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p288_366.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p288_367.txt|I am a star.
p288_368.txt|Not so, it seems.
p288_369.txt|Who was the mystery MP?
p288_370.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p288_371.txt|The play is based on a real-life event.
p288_372.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p288_373.txt|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p288_374.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p288_375.txt|We do not get that impression now.
p288_376.txt|They play together perfectly.
p288_377.txt|It was a funny game.
p288_378.txt|It is a large number.
p288_379.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p288_380.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p288_381.txt|I know I'm in a very special position.
p288_382.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p288_383.txt|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p288_384.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p288_385.txt|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p288_386.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p288_387.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p288_388.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p288_389.txt|It's just outrageous.
p288_390.txt|It's like a basketball.
p288_391.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p288_392.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p288_393.txt|It is not normal practice.
p288_394.txt|This is a major step forward for carers.
p288_395.txt|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p288_396.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p288_397.txt|Emotions were complex.
p288_398.txt|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p288_399.txt|He's already made history.
p288_400.txt|Then , he laughs.
p288_401.txt|You ask the question.
p288_402.txt|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p288_403.txt|What would be the point?
p288_404.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p288_405.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p288_406.txt|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p288_407.txt|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288_408.txt|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p288_409.txt|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p288_410.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p288_411.txt|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p288_412.txt|That may be.
p292_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p292_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p292_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p292_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p292_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p292_025.txt|I was not involved in these discussions.
p292_026.txt|O, Is he conscious?
p292_027.txt|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292_028.txt|They are being deported from their homes.
p292_029.txt|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292_030.txt|I thought the game was very poor.
p292_031.txt|Three days later, he was killed.
p292_032.txt|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_033.txt|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
p292_034.txt|It was a deceit.
p292_035.txt|You are in power.
p292_036.txt|PR will be just one of them.
p292_037.txt|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292_038.txt|It is just like the stock market.
p292_039.txt|And the newspapers were full of it.
p292_040.txt|I wish the solutions were as easy.
p292_041.txt|She does not see anything ever changing.
p292_042.txt|It doesn't come any better than this.
p292_043.txt|Mr Blair should be warned.
p292_044.txt|The idea has potential for the future.
p292_045.txt|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p292_046.txt|That was not due to me.
p292_047.txt|Structural changes were also required.
p292_048.txt|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p292_049.txt|The racist abuse was terrible.
p292_050.txt|What is the new religion?
p292_051.txt|Five officers were injured.
p292_052.txt|It was all for good reason as well.
p292_053.txt|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292_054.txt|I'm trying not to think about that.
p292_055.txt|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_056.txt|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_057.txt|One woman refused to sit down.
p292_058.txt|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_059.txt|I was completely knackered.
p292_060.txt|There are two interests in this woodland.
p292_061.txt|A killer is also on the loose.
p292_062.txt|Last night, the row continued.
p292_063.txt|Our approach will be different.
p292_064.txt|You can see how he made his money.
p292_065.txt|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p292_066.txt|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_067.txt|We tend to come good at the end.
p292_068.txt|His record with England was not good.
p292_069.txt|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p292_070.txt|Three penalties were given.
p292_071.txt|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_072.txt|He was between people and God.
p292_073.txt|We are just being flooded.
p292_074.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p292_075.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292_076.txt|There were no proposals on the table.
p292_077.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p292_078.txt|THERE's only one word for it.
p292_079.txt|It was very full anyway.
p292_080.txt|That was him under pressure.
p292_081.txt|I can't believe she is dead.
p292_082.txt|I was in prison for a year.
p292_083.txt|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_084.txt|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_085.txt|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p292_086.txt|I am constantly changing my mind.
p292_087.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p292_088.txt|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_089.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p292_090.txt|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p292_091.txt|It was that kind of afternoon.
p292_092.txt|His presence was very important.
p292_093.txt|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_094.txt|He insisted that his staff were too.
p292_095.txt|They should come clean.
p292_096.txt|Let's see that increase over the years.
p292_097.txt|That, though, is an old story.
p292_098.txt|The real issue is personal.
p292_099.txt|Life becomes a song.
p292_100.txt|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p292_101.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p292_102.txt|So far this season this approach is working.
p292_103.txt|I have got a knife.
p292_104.txt|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p292_105.txt|What did we learn?
p292_106.txt|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p292_107.txt|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p292_108.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p292_109.txt|It's nice to be involved.
p292_110.txt|There could still be some to come forward.
p292_111.txt|What are they like?
p292_112.txt|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p292_113.txt|The squad is too small.
p292_114.txt|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292_115.txt|I'm just going to do my best.
p292_116.txt|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p292_117.txt|They offered to make an investment into it.
p292_118.txt|We have no knowledge of this.
p292_119.txt|I was influenced by all of these things.
p292_120.txt|Is my wife a racist?
p292_121.txt|This would not be my first choice.
p292_122.txt|It certainly should not be used too often.
p292_123.txt|They will run a mile.
p292_124.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p292_125.txt|Britain has never had it so good.
p292_126.txt|We are under no illusions about this.
p292_127.txt|But the killer remains at large.
p292_128.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p292_129.txt|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p292_130.txt|I had a train to catch.
p292_131.txt|It is a terrible loss.
p292_132.txt|What's happening to her?
p292_133.txt|It was even worse than at home.
p292_134.txt|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p292_135.txt|The plane was in flames
p292_136.txt|We cannot lose it.
p292_137.txt|I still think he will win.
p292_138.txt|Elections would follow in about two years.
p292_139.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p292_140.txt|I've got to get on with my career.
p292_141.txt|It is a road of death.
p292_142.txt|Now we look forward to it.
p292_143.txt|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292_144.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292_145.txt|I have a great respect for her.
p292_146.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p292_147.txt|IT takes the biscuit.
p292_148.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p292_149.txt|You're not going to forget something like that.
p292_150.txt|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_151.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p292_152.txt|This is the root of their problems.
p292_153.txt|Other forces were, however, at work.
p292_154.txt|He also has property interests in the country.
p292_155.txt|That takes time and games and practice.
p292_156.txt|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p292_157.txt|It is a new company for Scotland.
p292_158.txt|We should have gone solo.
p292_159.txt|We don't even know his name.
p292_160.txt|They have known the hard times.
p292_161.txt|It is about the script for me.
p292_162.txt|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292_163.txt|The president will not be removed from office.
p292_164.txt|These are serious matters.
p292_165.txt|Are you all right at the front?
p292_166.txt|We want to replicate that success.
p292_167.txt|It was the first time they met.
p292_168.txt|It's been a good year.
p292_169.txt|I was never alone with her, right?
p292_170.txt|That will be vital.
p292_171.txt|It's a technical demand.
p292_172.txt|It's just a normal life.
p292_173.txt|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p292_174.txt|This is a very high price.
p292_175.txt|He is the example for all of us.
p292_176.txt|There is no way to do this.
p292_177.txt|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292_178.txt|Only one person can claim the credit.
p292_179.txt|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292_180.txt|O Neill has delivered.
p292_181.txt|But there was no going back.
p292_182.txt|We will reform the welfare state.
p292_183.txt|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p292_184.txt|We didn't think anything would happen.
p292_185.txt|He had come of age.
p292_186.txt|We were a shambles at the back.
p292_187.txt|It's not before time.
p292_188.txt|One of these problems is the railways.
p292_189.txt|It is a very sad day.
p292_190.txt|A crucial moment has arrived.
p292_191.txt|I have nothing to hide.
p292_192.txt|Next time round, it will be different.
p292_193.txt|How can they get one?
p292_194.txt|Only local people are helping.
p292_195.txt|We had to work hard for it.
p292_196.txt|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p292_197.txt|This is my homeland.
p292_198.txt|You saw the pain he was in.
p292_199.txt|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p292_200.txt|Drugs are always an issue.
p292_201.txt|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292_202.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p292_203.txt|It has affected me.
p292_204.txt|She made no further comment.
p292_205.txt|I have no conflict with them.
p292_206.txt|The next one comes up.
p292_207.txt|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p292_208.txt|We've got better players here.
p292_209.txt|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292_210.txt|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292_211.txt|People have no chance of getting out.
p292_212.txt|I am appalled by this news.
p292_213.txt|We were extremely arrogant.
p292_214.txt|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p292_215.txt|I was just getting over the time difference.
p292_216.txt|I am proud of moments like that.
p292_217.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p292_218.txt|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p292_219.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p292_220.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292_221.txt|You cannot allow it to go on.
p292_222.txt|It's up to the defence team.
p292_223.txt|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292_224.txt|No means testing will be required.
p292_225.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p292_226.txt|I don't think that's very fair.
p292_227.txt|He was on a horse.
p292_228.txt|Human beings are always the same.
p292_229.txt|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292_230.txt|If only he knew himself.
p292_231.txt|This action could have been avoided.
p292_232.txt|I watched a game.
p292_233.txt|Anyone else can apply.
p292_234.txt|It was like the old days.
p292_235.txt|This was never a support group.
p292_236.txt|The first time you read a play.
p292_237.txt|I was a little surprised.
p292_238.txt|This is my home town.
p292_239.txt|That was six years ago.
p292_240.txt|Nothing can bring back their son.
p292_241.txt|It is up to us to approve it.
p292_242.txt|His musicals were very much of their time.
p292_243.txt|They might well be right.
p292_244.txt|There is great demand for human cloning.
p292_245.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p292_246.txt|It starts to get you down.
p292_247.txt|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292_248.txt|My life has been turned upside down.
p292_249.txt|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_250.txt|I have played well the past two days.
p292_251.txt|I said, What was that about?
p292_252.txt|This could prove a problem.
p292_253.txt|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p292_254.txt|His game was complete.
p292_255.txt|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292_256.txt|This is too much like Scotland.
p292_257.txt|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p292_258.txt|That goes back a long way.
p292_259.txt|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292_260.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p292_261.txt|We will not tolerate it.
p292_262.txt|It should not make the same mistake again.
p292_263.txt|They loved it and it showed.
p292_264.txt|However, by then the damage had been done.
p292_265.txt|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p292_266.txt|Have we not been here before?
p292_267.txt|Just what we didn't need.
p292_268.txt|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292_269.txt|It is a very beautiful city.
p292_270.txt|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292_271.txt|The company reacted very, very well.
p292_272.txt|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p292_273.txt|The issues are very intense.
p292_274.txt|It won't be their last.
p292_275.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p292_276.txt|I'll tell you honestly.
p292_277.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p292_278.txt|It has been only average.
p292_279.txt|He should be worried about me.
p292_280.txt|That never happens in real life.
p292_281.txt|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292_282.txt|That was the gimmick.
p292_283.txt|This is a national crisis.
p292_284.txt|He has changed my life forever.
p292_285.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292_286.txt|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p292_287.txt|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292_288.txt|However, we had no failures in our side.
p292_289.txt|This is his first movie.
p292_290.txt|He already had had complaints.
p292_291.txt|For that much we must be grateful.
p292_292.txt|Spent three months alone at sea.
p292_293.txt|They are the heroes.
p292_294.txt|That will be the key to success.
p292_295.txt|They are in good spirits.
p292_296.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p292_297.txt|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p292_298.txt|I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292_299.txt|I'm going to miss it.
p292_300.txt|The atmosphere was excellent.
p292_301.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p292_302.txt|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p292_303.txt|One was a lawyer.
p292_304.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p292_305.txt|It may have been a cry for help.
p292_306.txt|His descent was pathetic.
p292_307.txt|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p292_308.txt|But let's not get carried away.
p292_309.txt|It's only tackling congestion.
p292_310.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292_311.txt|We've seen that time and time again.
p292_312.txt|Friends of the family have given their support.
p292_313.txt|This means a great deal to the families.
p292_314.txt|They said that they stood by their statement.
p292_315.txt|It should be equal.
p292_316.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p292_317.txt|He was always nice to me.
p292_318.txt|Is he going to look after them?
p292_319.txt|He had no answer.
p292_320.txt|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p292_321.txt|Special measures were needed.
p292_322.txt|Your father was a good man.
p292_323.txt|You do that because you want to win.
p292_324.txt|The whole family was in shock.
p292_325.txt|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p292_326.txt|My whole life has changed.
p292_327.txt|They always seem to produce.
p292_328.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292_329.txt|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p292_330.txt|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292_331.txt|The company's in good shape.
p292_332.txt|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292_333.txt|It is out there.
p292_334.txt|This country has many challenges.
p292_335.txt|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p292_336.txt|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p292_337.txt|To begin with it looks good.
p292_338.txt|They are with their father.
p292_339.txt|This was a unique election.
p292_340.txt|The review has been conducted fairly.
p292_341.txt|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p292_342.txt|I had to win this race.
p292_343.txt|And right now, it isn't there.
p292_344.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p292_345.txt|Donald was his friend.
p292_346.txt|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p292_347.txt|The girls are ready to compete.
p292_348.txt|It gives us something to work on.
p292_349.txt|It was all too little, too late.
p292_350.txt|What's the problem with change?
p292_351.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p292_352.txt|There are moments of silence.
p292_353.txt|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_354.txt|The board of governors must act.
p292_355.txt|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p292_356.txt|It is time for a new approach.
p292_357.txt|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_358.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p292_359.txt|There's no choice is there?
p292_360.txt|Does it, Noel?
p292_361.txt|Do not forget about Monaco.
p292_362.txt|You can't give in to the vandals.
p292_363.txt|Glasgow is far from overload.
p292_364.txt|Everything was an effort.
p292_365.txt|And does it even matter?
p292_366.txt|My parents are exhausted.
p292_367.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p292_368.txt|That's why he is a national treasure.
p292_369.txt|I'm delighted for Andy.
p292_370.txt|And how he kept his word.
p292_371.txt|It's their duty to protect them.
p292_372.txt|The Cup has come home.
p292_373.txt|This is a big, big win.
p292_374.txt|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
p292_375.txt|That's an equally important factor.
p292_376.txt|We were given a break.
p292_377.txt|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p292_378.txt|That would have killed the match.
p292_379.txt|That's not like us at all.
p292_380.txt|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292_381.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292_382.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p292_383.txt|Politics is a tough game.
p292_384.txt|This season has been a nightmare.
p292_385.txt|Everyone could see the joke.
p292_386.txt|He is just a wonderful actor.
p292_387.txt|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_388.txt|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292_389.txt|Such cases are on the increase.
p292_390.txt|This was not helpful.
p292_391.txt|The police are not the target.
p292_392.txt|It's a true story.
p292_393.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p292_394.txt|But that title is a mistake.
p292_395.txt|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p292_396.txt|I'd rather have been playing.
p292_397.txt|I am immensely sad.
p292_398.txt|Several others were absent.
p292_399.txt|It is surprising to come back this way.
p292_400.txt|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p292_401.txt|Could they perhaps be related?
p292_402.txt|We all thought we were going to die.
p292_403.txt|I knew she was going to win.
p292_404.txt|What is the Barnett formula?
p292_405.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p292_406.txt|A suspicion was not enough.
p292_407.txt|It will probably be my last, too.
p292_408.txt|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p292_409.txt|It is good for Europe.
p292_410.txt|I am looking forward to this film.
p292_411.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p292_412.txt|They would not tell us.
p292_413.txt|The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_414.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p292_415.txt|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p292_416.txt|A venue was found.
p292_417.txt|I will always remember the horrible images.
p292_418.txt|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p292_419.txt|But a surprise is in store.
p292_420.txt|You can cope with it.
p292_421.txt|He was back to square one.
p292_422.txt|We didn't get any from his face.
p292_423.txt|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p292_424.txt|It's time for a change.
p293_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p293_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p293_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p293_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p293_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p293_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p293_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p293_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p293_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p293_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p293_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p293_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p293_025.txt|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p293_026.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p293_027.txt|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p293_028.txt|All my training is for Athens.
p293_029.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p293_030.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p293_032.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p293_033.txt|Several others were absent.
p293_034.txt|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p293_035.txt|There is a lot of heroin about.
p293_036.txt|There is a growing anger among the group.
p293_037.txt|I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_038.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p293_039.txt|It's a sensible management decision.
p293_040.txt|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293_041.txt|I would just like someone to confess.
p293_042.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p293_043.txt|We can be proud of our achievements.
p293_044.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p293_045.txt|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_046.txt|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293_047.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p293_048.txt|Ferguson must take the blame.
p293_049.txt|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_050.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293_051.txt|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_052.txt|It is a large number.
p293_053.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p293_054.txt|General, You didn't get a modified.
p293_055.txt|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_056.txt|That is our unfinished business.
p293_057.txt|This is far too high.
p293_058.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_059.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p293_060.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p293_061.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_062.txt|So they will settle again.
p293_063.txt|He had other things on his mind.
p293_064.txt|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_065.txt|Let us hope so.
p293_066.txt|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p293_067.txt|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
p293_068.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_069.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_070.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p293_071.txt|So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_072.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p293_073.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_074.txt|We've had our problems at the club.
p293_075.txt|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293_076.txt|More than half of the school collapsed.
p293_077.txt|We also hope to meet the men.
p293_078.txt|I can live with just the one.
p293_079.txt|All the people thought that we would die.
p293_080.txt|Sometimes they come off.
p293_081.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p293_082.txt|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p293_083.txt|However, my position remains the same.
p293_084.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p293_085.txt|There are plenty examples.
p293_086.txt|Self control is just one instalment.
p293_087.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p293_088.txt|I could not believe what they were saying.
p293_089.txt|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
p293_090.txt|Will he be given time?
p293_091.txt|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293_092.txt|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p293_093.txt|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p293_094.txt|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_095.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p293_096.txt|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p293_097.txt|It has been hijacked.
p293_098.txt|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p293_099.txt|They must put them back.
p293_100.txt|You do have a way out.
p293_101.txt|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293_102.txt|This is not a European Army.
p293_103.txt|These guys are looking for business.
p293_104.txt|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p293_105.txt|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p293_106.txt|It was different in the endurance events.
p293_107.txt|They will now have to justify their position.
p293_108.txt|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p293_109.txt|The objective was achieved.
p293_110.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p293_111.txt|Look at his last couple of records.
p293_112.txt|There is no musical background in his family.
p293_113.txt|The cost of war is more than that.
p293_114.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p293_115.txt|The door is open.
p293_116.txt|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p293_117.txt|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p293_118.txt|These are long-term investments.
p293_119.txt|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p293_120.txt|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p293_121.txt|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293_122.txt|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p293_123.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p293_124.txt|You ask the question.
p293_125.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p293_126.txt|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p293_127.txt|The Taliban response was swift.
p293_128.txt|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p293_129.txt|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p293_130.txt|They have their own interests and techniques.
p293_131.txt|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293_132.txt|The firm was down and almost out.
p293_133.txt|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p293_134.txt|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p293_135.txt|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p293_136.txt|That is why we are here.
p293_137.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p293_138.txt|Somehow they got out.
p293_139.txt|The house was so well alight.
p293_140.txt|I've been very nervous.
p293_141.txt|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293_142.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p293_143.txt|The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_144.txt|The Treasury denied the claims.
p293_145.txt|The same goes for McKenna.
p293_146.txt|Perhaps it should stay there.
p293_147.txt|You can be sure we will have problems.
p293_148.txt|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p293_149.txt|We had to take action to protect them.
p293_150.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293_151.txt|Our policy is clear.
p293_152.txt|I think we have a very strong case.
p293_153.txt|Who would be out there, singing?
p293_154.txt|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p293_155.txt|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p293_156.txt|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p293_157.txt|Horses have some sense.
p293_158.txt|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p293_159.txt|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p293_160.txt|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p293_161.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p293_162.txt|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p293_163.txt|Politics is a tough game.
p293_164.txt|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p293_165.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p293_166.txt|It is physical but it is also good.
p293_167.txt|It's unfair on her.
p293_168.txt|So, easy does it.
p293_169.txt|I just want to enjoy myself.
p293_170.txt|We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_171.txt|At this point we can only speculate.
p293_172.txt|Family members are at her bedside.
p293_173.txt|I am very shocked.
p293_174.txt|The people here are quite reserved.
p293_175.txt|When will this change?
p293_176.txt|It has made me feel good.
p293_177.txt|It's been such a long haul.
p293_178.txt|This gives us a lot of practice.
p293_179.txt|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p293_180.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p293_181.txt|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p293_182.txt|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p293_183.txt|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p293_184.txt|It was his job to check.
p293_185.txt|This is the stuff of live music.
p293_186.txt|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
p293_187.txt|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p293_188.txt|But Allen is deadly serious.
p293_189.txt|It's a huge amount.
p293_190.txt|The fire was falling from the sky.
p293_191.txt|So he was anxious to try something new.
p293_192.txt|But he is something special, is he not?
p293_193.txt|This is simply unjust.
p293_194.txt|A final decision is expected by Friday.
p293_195.txt|We will do so again.
p293_196.txt|We will only move forward.
p293_197.txt|I'm a bit annoyed.
p293_198.txt|It ignores the future.
p293_199.txt|I am just looking to God.
p293_200.txt|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p293_201.txt|What's the rush?
p293_202.txt|It would also take time.
p293_203.txt|Nothing is ruled out.
p293_204.txt|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p293_205.txt|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
p293_206.txt|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p293_207.txt|He was also married with two children.
p293_208.txt|His conclusion is upbeat.
p293_209.txt|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
p293_210.txt|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p293_211.txt|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p293_212.txt|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293_213.txt|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293_214.txt|The replacements made a big difference.
p293_215.txt|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p293_216.txt|A web site's planned for November.
p293_217.txt|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p293_218.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p293_219.txt|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p293_220.txt|Who would be in that desert?
p293_221.txt|It will take some time to establish.
p293_222.txt|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293_223.txt|We never got off the bus.
p293_224.txt|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p293_225.txt|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p293_226.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p293_227.txt|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p293_228.txt|These will be finally corrected by next week.
p293_229.txt|They will form a tribute.
p293_230.txt|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p293_231.txt|I think in three dimensions.
p293_232.txt|Three others were wounded.
p293_233.txt|They had four children together.
p293_234.txt|It's a way of making a mark.
p293_235.txt|There is a great carry over value.
p293_236.txt|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p293_237.txt|That was my own personal decision.
p293_238.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p293_239.txt|She returned home a few days later.
p293_240.txt|I have been here for only three months.
p293_241.txt|So what's wrong with Scotland?
p293_242.txt|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p293_243.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p293_244.txt|It gave me something to focus on.
p293_245.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p293_246.txt|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p293_247.txt|She is fulfilled by it.
p293_248.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p293_249.txt|Nobody has been put on trial.
p293_250.txt|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p293_251.txt|Also, he was flawed.
p293_252.txt|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p293_253.txt|I just could not cope.
p293_254.txt|They may differ on other issues.
p293_255.txt|In short, the club was broke.
p293_256.txt|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p293_257.txt|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p293_258.txt|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p293_259.txt|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p293_260.txt|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p293_261.txt|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p293_262.txt|The Commons is too outdated.
p293_263.txt|It feels like a privilege.
p293_264.txt|We have got a full house tonight.
p293_265.txt|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p293_266.txt|He will be advised by me.
p293_267.txt|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
p293_268.txt|Our children are our future.
p293_269.txt|It's part of your life.
p293_270.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p293_271.txt|I was furious about it.
p293_272.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p293_273.txt|It is typical of me.
p293_274.txt|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p293_275.txt|Life becomes a song.
p293_276.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p293_277.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p293_278.txt|This avalanche is just beginning.
p293_279.txt|That, however, is only part of their story.
p293_280.txt|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p293_281.txt|I was living with my mum.
p293_282.txt|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p293_283.txt|The whole process was so different.
p293_284.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p293_285.txt|They feel it belongs to them.
p293_286.txt|I don't know why she is not here.
p293_287.txt|They certainly do not socialise.
p293_288.txt|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293_289.txt|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p293_290.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p293_291.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p293_292.txt|We told them in June.
p293_293.txt|If so, we want to hear from them.
p293_294.txt|They never gave up hope.
p293_295.txt|Construction is due to begin in February.
p293_296.txt|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p293_297.txt|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p293_298.txt|The red card was okay.
p293_300.txt|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p293_301.txt|But they will not be compelled to join.
p293_302.txt|It will vote with the US.
p293_303.txt|There will be no disruption to teaching.
p293_304.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p293_305.txt|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p293_306.txt|Again the verdict was not proven.
p293_307.txt|We've just got to work a bit better.
p293_308.txt|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p293_309.txt|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p293_310.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p293_311.txt|Four had been brought down.
p293_312.txt|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p293_313.txt|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p293_314.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p293_315.txt|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p293_316.txt|Last year, however, was a different story.
p293_317.txt|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p293_318.txt|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p293_319.txt|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p293_320.txt|Eleven events are required.
p293_321.txt|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p293_322.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p293_323.txt|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p293_324.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p293_325.txt|You've gotten all the facts.
p293_326.txt|It possibly depends on the position.
p293_327.txt|Life is too short.
p293_328.txt|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p293_329.txt|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p293_330.txt|He's very young but he is growing up.
p293_331.txt|He is in charge on the pitch.
p293_332.txt|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p293_333.txt|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p293_334.txt|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p293_335.txt|They had asked not to be named.
p293_336.txt|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p293_337.txt|A whole range of factors are involved.
p293_338.txt|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p293_339.txt|They would love to do more films.
p293_340.txt|I have great sympathy with these people.
p293_341.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p293_342.txt|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p293_343.txt|It raises a serious question mark.
p293_344.txt|He is dying from cancer.
p293_345.txt|The package has been properly costed.
p293_346.txt|The attitude and commitment was decent.
p293_347.txt|The feeling is awesome.
p293_348.txt|He quit in October.
p293_349.txt|The family also declined to discuss the case.
p293_350.txt|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p293_351.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p293_352.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p293_354.txt|Failure is a curious concept.
p293_355.txt|But it can happen for Tiger.
p293_356.txt|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p293_357.txt|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p293_358.txt|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p293_359.txt|The initial reaction was disbelief.
p293_360.txt|All these things have an impact.
p293_361.txt|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p293_362.txt|I now know that from memory.
p293_363.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p293_364.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p293_365.txt|He doesn't even know who he is.
p293_366.txt|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p293_367.txt|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
p293_368.txt|The men are safe and unharmed.
p293_369.txt|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p293_370.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p293_371.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p293_372.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p293_373.txt|But it was to no avail.
p293_374.txt|I don't think the referees are against us.
p293_375.txt|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p293_376.txt|It is not a road of life.
p293_377.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p293_378.txt|It is three years at present.
p293_379.txt|My husband was fighting for his life.
p293_380.txt|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p293_381.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p293_382.txt|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p293_383.txt|The penalty was the turning point.
p293_384.txt|I have chosen to do this research.
p293_385.txt|It was even worse than at home.
p293_386.txt|Michael's putting on a brave face.
p293_387.txt|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p293_388.txt|I am sure that this will happen again.
p293_389.txt|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p293_390.txt|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p293_391.txt|I do not believe they are.
p293_392.txt|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293_393.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p293_394.txt|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p293_395.txt|This is a completely new experience for me.
p293_396.txt|I should never have come over to Fife.
p293_397.txt|What kind of person is he?
p293_398.txt|Their bid was a very good one.
p293_399.txt|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p293_400.txt|And this tournament will travel.
p294_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p294_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p294_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p294_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p294_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p294_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p294_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p294_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p294_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p294_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p294_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p294_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p294_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p294_025.txt|They were the better team on the night.
p294_026.txt|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
p294_027.txt|It means we have to have some patience.
p294_028.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p294_029.txt|I was pregnant and very worried.
p294_030.txt|He said she was mad.
p294_031.txt|They were impressive against France.
p294_032.txt|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294_033.txt|The airport was even different.
p294_034.txt|Other people had looked at it.
p294_035.txt|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_036.txt|Michael, he is running!
p294_037.txt|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p294_038.txt|Their ambition is to go back.
p294_039.txt|He got the same story.
p294_040.txt|My view has now changed completely.
p294_041.txt|I've been dying for an hour.
p294_042.txt|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_043.txt|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_044.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_045.txt|They tend to be female and retired.
p294_046.txt|Who was the mystery MP?
p294_047.txt|This was no accident.
p294_048.txt|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_049.txt|We've all done it!
p294_050.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p294_051.txt|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p294_052.txt|The course record was in his name.
p294_053.txt|But we welcome this document.
p294_054.txt|What is the point of jailing him?
p294_055.txt|We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_056.txt|This is a possible way forward.
p294_057.txt|I am not here to get even.
p294_058.txt|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p294_059.txt|We are only human.
p294_060.txt|I went with the mood.
p294_061.txt|I think we'll just keep it.
p294_062.txt|Debate is not just talk.
p294_063.txt|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_064.txt|It is all about having physical evidence.
p294_065.txt|People remember the Tories in office.
p294_066.txt|What kind of inclusion is that?
p294_067.txt|I fell in love with it right away.
p294_068.txt|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_069.txt|It makes for an interesting conference.
p294_070.txt|I don't have any answer for them.
p294_071.txt|It took about five or six hours.
p294_072.txt|I found the course inspiring.
p294_073.txt|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_074.txt|This is the real thing now.
p294_075.txt|Until they came to do it.
p294_076.txt|She now lives in London.
p294_077.txt|It will not be a long campaign.
p294_078.txt|Subs not used, McGraw.
p294_079.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p294_080.txt|One policeman was killed.
p294_081.txt|They could not have done more for me.
p294_082.txt|It was like a vacuum.
p294_083.txt|That was enough for the committee.
p294_084.txt|It is a very genuine prospect.
p294_085.txt|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_086.txt|We have to focus on what is important.
p294_087.txt|They have to work so hard.
p294_088.txt|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
p294_089.txt|Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294_090.txt|He had just returned from a run.
p294_091.txt|There's a strong involvement.
p294_092.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p294_093.txt|But now it's back to golf.
p294_094.txt|It should be a condition of employment.
p294_095.txt|Was it a signal?
p294_096.txt|It may not even be possible.
p294_097.txt|In fact, they go hand in hand.
p294_098.txt|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p294_099.txt|So is that it, then?
p294_100.txt|You should have let it write the cards.
p294_101.txt|It's annoying in a way.
p294_102.txt|It's too close to call.
p294_103.txt|It's a long process.
p294_104.txt|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p294_105.txt|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p294_106.txt|The other conditions were not specified.
p294_107.txt|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p294_108.txt|That's not part of the deal.
p294_109.txt|That was the context of his remarks.
p294_110.txt|This has gone on too long.
p294_111.txt|We have great confidence in Derek.
p294_112.txt|My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_113.txt|I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_114.txt|The industry will try to get round it.
p294_115.txt|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294_116.txt|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_117.txt|And she got it.
p294_118.txt|We are the weakest link.
p294_119.txt|We have now no choice.
p294_120.txt|My father and mother are.
p294_121.txt|We don't know what happened after.
p294_122.txt|Did he just want to be on telly?
p294_123.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p294_124.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p294_125.txt|We have very real concerns about it.
p294_126.txt|He has gone through the process before.
p294_127.txt|People will see this over time.
p294_128.txt|I can't speak for him.
p294_129.txt|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294_130.txt|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294_131.txt|I can't see him reversing that.
p294_132.txt|I'm deeply sorry they did.
p294_133.txt|I can lead by example.
p294_134.txt|I have had a wonderful career.
p294_135.txt|It seemed to have direction.
p294_136.txt|This takes the pressure off.
p294_137.txt|It was different in the endurance events.
p294_138.txt|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
p294_139.txt|The objective was achieved.
p294_140.txt|It was a hugely popular decision.
p294_141.txt|He invented the language.
p294_142.txt|Where are they?
p294_143.txt|It's hard not to.
p294_144.txt|It is a question of life and death.
p294_145.txt|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p294_146.txt|You ask the question.
p294_147.txt|She was always a quality act.
p294_148.txt|We are all very proud of her.
p294_149.txt|I'm sure that is not.
p294_150.txt|It's a great idea.
p294_151.txt|It's like a score in some ways.
p294_152.txt|It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_153.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p294_154.txt|Therein lies the problem.
p294_155.txt|You feel the pride.
p294_156.txt|We are well insured.
p294_157.txt|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_158.txt|The Treasury denied the claims.
p294_159.txt|You've been working for four years.
p294_160.txt|I am the Son of Sam.
p294_161.txt|There is no shortage of commitment.
p294_162.txt|Such as it is.
p294_163.txt|He deserves a second chance.
p294_164.txt|He also admitted.
p294_165.txt|There was no change in the strategy.
p294_166.txt|There's been a mistake.
p294_167.txt|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p294_168.txt|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_169.txt|I enjoy my work.
p294_170.txt|We have managed to get it under control.
p294_171.txt|We have a genuine budget in place.
p294_172.txt|Art is still a risky investment.
p294_173.txt|It was little else.
p294_174.txt|These things can happen.
p294_175.txt|Family members are at her bedside.
p294_176.txt|You have to go to the edges.
p294_177.txt|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294_178.txt|Harry will be up for it.
p294_179.txt|He could tell you.
p294_180.txt|My place is in the kitchen.
p294_181.txt|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
p294_182.txt|A decision is expected in September.
p294_183.txt|It was a big departure.
p294_184.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p294_185.txt|It's a huge amount.
p294_186.txt|The fire was falling from the sky.
p294_187.txt|I want my mum.
p294_188.txt|This is simply unjust.
p294_189.txt|The First Minister is an addict.
p294_190.txt|Its role is not to interfere.
p294_191.txt|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_192.txt|You can't believe a word.
p294_193.txt|Something happened on that island.
p294_194.txt|You can't get a mortgage.
p294_195.txt|It is misleading to compare the two.
p294_196.txt|I want a career.
p294_197.txt|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_198.txt|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_199.txt|That's been the case for a while.
p294_200.txt|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p294_201.txt|All options are on the table.
p294_202.txt|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294_203.txt|We now have a moment of hope.
p294_204.txt|They should not be blamed for it.
p294_205.txt|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_206.txt|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294_207.txt|It will take some time to establish.
p294_208.txt|This club is perfect for me.
p294_209.txt|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
p294_210.txt|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_211.txt|I love this job.
p294_212.txt|I have no secrets.
p294_213.txt|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p294_214.txt|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p294_215.txt|They will form a tribute.
p294_216.txt|We're very, very excited.
p294_217.txt|It's not a question of talking.
p294_218.txt|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294_219.txt|Then they killed another three.
p294_220.txt|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p294_221.txt|The six others were injured.
p294_222.txt|She has so much to offer.
p294_223.txt|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_224.txt|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p294_225.txt|Gas is too expensive.
p294_226.txt|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p294_227.txt|Are we going mainstream?
p294_228.txt|I could not believe what they were saying.
p294_229.txt|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p294_230.txt|Who will run the bigger show?
p294_231.txt|General, You didn't get a modified.
p294_232.txt|I'm not a little girl.
p294_233.txt|We have seen the future, and it is different.
p294_234.txt|Who does he think will win?
p294_235.txt|We're talking about one or two years.
p294_236.txt|I just have to accept that.
p294_237.txt|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p294_238.txt|They will do nothing for the local people.
p294_239.txt|Do it for us now.
p294_240.txt|We got the guarantee.
p294_241.txt|I couldn't have asked for better.
p294_242.txt|That is however, the only part of the story.
p294_243.txt|But happily, the story is true.
p294_244.txt|They are not suitable.
p294_245.txt|Some days are different from others.
p294_247.txt|Everything else is the same.
p294_248.txt|They never gave up hope.
p294_249.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p294_250.txt|There are no excuses left for us.
p294_251.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p294_252.txt|His director of football is leaving.
p294_253.txt|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_254.txt|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_255.txt|There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_256.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p294_257.txt|I get on him, he gets on me.
p294_258.txt|They are in care for a reason.
p294_259.txt|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294_260.txt|I haven't a clue.
p294_261.txt|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294_262.txt|I thought he was terrific.
p294_263.txt|A statement is expected in April.
p294_264.txt|It possibly depends on the position.
p294_265.txt|This will have no effect on the championship.
p294_266.txt|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_267.txt|I would love to travel with it.
p294_268.txt|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_269.txt|It is a common condition in children.
p294_270.txt|We will work through the night.
p294_271.txt|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p294_272.txt|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
p294_273.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p294_274.txt|It's as simple as that.
p294_275.txt|We've been here before.
p294_276.txt|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p294_277.txt|From there, it was a success story.
p294_278.txt|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_279.txt|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p294_280.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p294_281.txt|I've never seen them down here.
p294_282.txt|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p294_283.txt|This is our unfinished business.
p294_284.txt|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p294_285.txt|He had asked if they had the script.
p294_286.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p294_287.txt|This could take a few days.
p294_288.txt|A great deal was achieved.
p294_289.txt|So it was sad.
p294_290.txt|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_291.txt|There did not need to be a miracle.
p294_292.txt|This could also affect the sentencing.
p294_293.txt|That case has still not been settled.
p294_294.txt|What do they do, anyway?
p294_295.txt|They've got a mountain to climb.
p294_296.txt|It just would not work.
p294_297.txt|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p294_298.txt|Who will provide the wine?
p294_299.txt|We started from scratch.
p294_300.txt|There was no happiness.
p294_301.txt|Their bid was a very good one.
p294_302.txt|Everything is so commercial.
p294_303.txt|And this tournament will travel.
p294_304.txt|Could it have been better spent?
p294_305.txt|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p294_306.txt|The order went out.
p294_307.txt|Cinema is a communal experience.
p294_308.txt|The appeal is impartial.
p294_309.txt|You could see he was thinking about it.
p294_310.txt|He added, We are full of anger.
p294_311.txt|They have nowhere else to go.
p294_312.txt|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p294_313.txt|We work for the athlete.
p294_314.txt|It is three years at present.
p294_315.txt|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_316.txt|We all make mistakes.
p294_317.txt|It didn't put me off.
p294_318.txt|Now they have found out the truth.
p294_319.txt|It is an impressive record.
p294_320.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p294_321.txt|We know we have done wrong.
p294_322.txt|She was married with one son.
p294_323.txt|I wanted to drop out.
p294_324.txt|I told you so.
p294_325.txt|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p294_326.txt|Which is where the manager comes in.
p294_327.txt|Is that what people we want?
p294_328.txt|There are so many unanswered questions.
p294_329.txt|Then it was into a series of classes.
p294_330.txt|He wants to play in the Champions League.
p294_331.txt|I'm so happy that she did.
p294_332.txt|The need for further investment is obvious.
p294_333.txt|Iraq has no interest in war.
p294_334.txt|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
p294_335.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p294_336.txt|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294_337.txt|That period was a struggle.
p294_338.txt|No-one else was hurt.
p294_339.txt|What's it for?
p294_340.txt|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p294_341.txt|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294_342.txt|She is an imposing presence.
p294_343.txt|There are moments of joy in politics.
p294_344.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p294_345.txt|Where are you taking her?
p294_346.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p294_347.txt|It's just not our biggest problem.
p294_348.txt|The result could be all down to turnout.
p294_349.txt|I'm not going to change from it.
p294_350.txt|There were no violations.
p294_351.txt|That was the type of man he was.
p294_352.txt|They are not falling now.
p294_353.txt|They had to explain it.
p294_354.txt|We didn't mean to kill him.
p294_355.txt|The support of Britain is assumed.
p294_356.txt|So far he has not done so.
p294_357.txt|He completely loses control.
p294_358.txt|No decision on that was taken.
p294_359.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p294_360.txt|The trial continues today.
p294_361.txt|People come to see the Highlands.
p294_362.txt|Europe is a bonus.
p294_363.txt|It is also used to buy coffins.
p294_364.txt|I've got to provide for my family.
p294_365.txt|Such debate is pointless.
p294_366.txt|And it had two seats.
p294_367.txt|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_368.txt|He found it very hard to understand.
p294_369.txt|But it would change the context.
p294_370.txt|But who was driving it?
p294_371.txt|We recorded it at our own expense.
p294_372.txt|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_373.txt|Try to save us.
p294_374.txt|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
p294_375.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p294_376.txt|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p294_377.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p294_378.txt|There could be a way back.
p294_379.txt|He edited the press release.
p294_380.txt|Visitors were also impressed.
p294_381.txt|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p294_382.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p294_383.txt|Are there muscular problems?
p294_384.txt|We had our chances.
p294_385.txt|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p294_386.txt|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p294_387.txt|He is in the queue.
p294_388.txt|But what is?
p294_389.txt|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p294_390.txt|We have other options.
p294_391.txt|Calvin was back at his best today.
p294_392.txt|My mind was made up.
p294_393.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p294_394.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p294_395.txt|The council's concern is very simple.
p294_396.txt|We are on the path of change.
p294_397.txt|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p294_398.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_399.txt|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p294_400.txt|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
p294_401.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p294_402.txt|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294_403.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p294_404.txt|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p294_405.txt|It's a tragedy for the area.
p294_406.txt|It was very well received.
p294_407.txt|I don't think there's going to be one.
p294_408.txt|If you could find it.
p294_409.txt|Such is the ego involved.
p294_410.txt|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p294_411.txt|It raises the edge.
p294_412.txt|It was not known to myself.
p294_413.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p294_414.txt|Would it really be good to shorten it?
p294_415.txt|I don't entirely buy that.
p294_416.txt|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p294_417.txt|I saw it in a different way.
p294_418.txt|Or, rather, it isn't.
p294_419.txt|We have every respect for Michelle.
p294_420.txt|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p294_421.txt|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p294_422.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p294_423.txt|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p294_424.txt|He died at the hands of his captors.
p295_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p295_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p295_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p295_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p295_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p295_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p295_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p295_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p295_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p295_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p295_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p295_025.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p295_026.txt|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p295_027.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p295_028.txt|Because we do not need it.
p295_029.txt|It has been supremely successful.
p295_030.txt|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p295_031.txt|Which is where the manager comes in.
p295_032.txt|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p295_033.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295_034.txt|We thought we would never see them again.
p295_035.txt|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p295_036.txt|She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_037.txt|He must not be removed from office.
p295_038.txt|That means an extra two years.
p295_039.txt|I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_040.txt|Our children are the future of our society.
p295_041.txt|I'm sure he would love it.
p295_042.txt|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_043.txt|It's just not our biggest problem.
p295_044.txt|It is just like any other club.
p295_045.txt|Everything is possible in football.
p295_046.txt|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_048.txt|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295_049.txt|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_050.txt|He declined to give further details.
p295_051.txt|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_052.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_053.txt|For sure we want to win it.
p295_054.txt|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p295_055.txt|Such debate is pointless.
p295_056.txt|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p295_057.txt|We recorded it at our own expense.
p295_058.txt|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p295_059.txt|I knew there was a challenge for me.
p295_060.txt|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p295_061.txt|I just have no maternal instincts.
p295_062.txt|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p295_063.txt|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_064.txt|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p295_065.txt|Can you imagine a world without design?
p295_066.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p295_067.txt|And he listens to his artists as well.
p295_068.txt|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_069.txt|SO now we know the secret.
p295_070.txt|He's right up to a point.
p295_071.txt|We would have looked out for each other.
p295_072.txt|I had no choice but to leave.
p295_073.txt|Where does he go from here?
p295_074.txt|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_075.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p295_076.txt|But then they scored their fourth.
p295_077.txt|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p295_078.txt|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295_079.txt|It has to find out what went wrong.
p295_080.txt|People are already enjoying it.
p295_081.txt|We're just delighted to be back on top.
p295_082.txt|Or is it the European approach?
p295_083.txt|I had found my vision.
p295_084.txt|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p295_085.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p295_086.txt|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p295_087.txt|I don't entirely buy that.
p295_088.txt|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295_089.txt|It is giving out the wrong message.
p295_090.txt|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p295_091.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p295_092.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p295_093.txt|Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_094.txt|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_095.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p295_096.txt|We recognise it as a key area.
p295_097.txt|The mood was euphoric.
p295_098.txt|The time of judgment has arrived.
p295_099.txt|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295_100.txt|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p295_101.txt|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p295_102.txt|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p295_103.txt|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p295_104.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p295_105.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p295_106.txt|This has been a terrible experience.
p295_107.txt|He had a different agenda entirely.
p295_108.txt|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
p295_109.txt|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p295_110.txt|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p295_111.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295_112.txt|It is reform in return for resources.
p295_113.txt|It offers a different viewpoint.
p295_114.txt|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p295_115.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295_116.txt|I have no plans to retire.
p295_117.txt|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p295_118.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p295_119.txt|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295_120.txt|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p295_121.txt|This is a test of our character.
p295_122.txt|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p295_123.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p295_124.txt|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p295_125.txt|The look on his face was something special.
p295_126.txt|You have a very persuasive president.
p295_127.txt|Sure, we have problems.
p295_128.txt|We will provide immediate access.
p295_129.txt|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295_130.txt|Five years later, the deception continued.
p295_131.txt|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p295_132.txt|I can't see myself in one of those.
p295_133.txt|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p295_134.txt|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p295_135.txt|He added, We have the same desire.
p295_137.txt|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p295_138.txt|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p295_139.txt|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p295_140.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p295_141.txt|I got very, very tired.
p295_142.txt|What did you learn in school today?
p295_143.txt|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295_144.txt|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295_145.txt|He's working hard on that right now.
p295_146.txt|The jury is still out.
p295_147.txt|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295_148.txt|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p295_149.txt|I can't say that this is very usual.
p295_150.txt|We opened up and everything was gone.
p295_151.txt|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p295_152.txt|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p295_153.txt|I try to be open to experience.
p295_154.txt|I remember it clearly.
p295_155.txt|I'm sure they will be very happy.
p295_156.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p295_157.txt|We must get the three points.
p295_158.txt|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p295_159.txt|I feel alive and good today.
p295_160.txt|We're in England for the time being.
p295_161.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p295_162.txt|David Trimble has sold out.
p295_163.txt|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p295_164.txt|The voters are our masters.
p295_165.txt|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
p295_166.txt|He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_167.txt|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295_168.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p295_169.txt|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295_170.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295_171.txt|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p295_172.txt|You're not going to forget something like that.
p295_173.txt|They are in the euro.
p295_174.txt|The driver was unhurt.
p295_175.txt|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p295_176.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p295_177.txt|A bit of match fitness is required.
p295_178.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p295_179.txt|There's nothing new in that argument.
p295_180.txt|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p295_181.txt|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p295_182.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p295_183.txt|The deadline is real and absolute.
p295_184.txt|No means testing will be required.
p295_185.txt|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p295_186.txt|I'm sure it will go on.
p295_187.txt|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p295_188.txt|She is still very poorly.
p295_189.txt|That's how he did the damage.
p295_190.txt|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p295_191.txt|I need a publishing deal!
p295_192.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p295_193.txt|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p295_194.txt|Defeat is simply not an option.
p295_195.txt|We have all been there at some point.
p295_196.txt|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p295_197.txt|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
p295_198.txt|At least two women were among those arrested.
p295_199.txt|My intentions are to go on like this.
p295_200.txt|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295_201.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295_202.txt|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p295_203.txt|It's like an extension of your body.
p295_204.txt|That's why he is a national treasure.
p295_205.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p295_206.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295_207.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295_208.txt|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295_209.txt|We need to know more about her.
p295_210.txt|And what is she escaping from?
p295_211.txt|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295_212.txt|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295_213.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p295_214.txt|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_215.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295_216.txt|I don't know how they make the weight.
p295_217.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p295_218.txt|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295_219.txt|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p295_220.txt|The joint bid is still on course.
p295_221.txt|This is the best moment of my career.
p295_222.txt|My life has been turned upside down.
p295_224.txt|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p295_225.txt|Parole is a decision for me.
p295_226.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p295_227.txt|We don't have any senior players.
p295_228.txt|Not so, it transpires.
p295_229.txt|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p295_230.txt|This will help our confidence.
p295_231.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p295_232.txt|It is a very beautiful city.
p295_233.txt|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p295_234.txt|His father and mother are in film production.
p295_235.txt|It's about attitudes to change.
p295_236.txt|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295_237.txt|We have seen the failure of politics.
p295_238.txt|The party will make up its own mind.
p295_239.txt|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295_240.txt|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p295_241.txt|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p295_242.txt|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295_243.txt|When he came to see me on Monday.
p295_244.txt|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p295_245.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295_246.txt|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295_247.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
p295_248.txt|It became a book by itself.
p295_249.txt|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p295_250.txt|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p295_251.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295_252.txt|What kind of festival is proposed?
p295_253.txt|In my experience, he does not do that.
p295_254.txt|We're all involved in creating the work.
p295_255.txt|When we started the album.
p295_256.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295_257.txt|Controllers major concern is safety.
p295_258.txt|This is your country.
p295_259.txt|That's the most important thing for me.
p295_260.txt|But it was the sensible thing to do.
p295_261.txt|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_262.txt|The committees are due to report next year.
p295_263.txt|It was seriously unpleasant.
p295_264.txt|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p295_265.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p295_266.txt|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p295_267.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p295_268.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p295_269.txt|The airport was even different.
p295_270.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p295_271.txt|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p295_272.txt|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p295_273.txt|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p295_274.txt|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p295_275.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p295_276.txt|Manchester United are the classic example.
p295_277.txt|I've never regretted my decision.
p295_278.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p295_279.txt|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295_280.txt|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p295_281.txt|Surely it can't get any worse.
p295_282.txt|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p295_283.txt|We still have a long, long way to go.
p295_284.txt|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_285.txt|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p295_286.txt|I'm not sure.
p295_287.txt|But the championship is not over yet.
p295_288.txt|WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295_289.txt|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p295_290.txt|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295_291.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295_292.txt|Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_293.txt|My husband was angry.
p295_294.txt|You're going to die.
p295_295.txt|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p295_296.txt|We're not really commenting on that.
p295_297.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p295_298.txt|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_299.txt|Could they perhaps be related?
p295_300.txt|It should be a condition of employment.
p295_301.txt|It was not being marketed properly.
p295_302.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p295_303.txt|They know their son was murdered.
p295_304.txt|I love this tournament.
p295_305.txt|Nobody will be forced to work.
p295_306.txt|We're all going to take a holiday.
p295_307.txt|It is good for Europe.
p295_308.txt|This is your chance.
p295_309.txt|They told him to go to drama school.
p295_310.txt|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p295_311.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p295_312.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p295_313.txt|I think they are right to be impatient.
p295_314.txt|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p295_315.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p295_316.txt|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p295_317.txt|It's a member of your family.
p295_318.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p295_319.txt|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p295_320.txt|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p295_321.txt|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295_322.txt|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p295_323.txt|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_324.txt|It will not work in our favour.
p295_325.txt|We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295_326.txt|It was hugely popular decision.
p295_327.txt|The decision was left entirely to him.
p295_328.txt|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p295_329.txt|These findings are vitally important.
p295_330.txt|That's always the case, isn't it?
p295_331.txt|I certainly think it should be there.
p295_332.txt|I'm sure that they will learn.
p295_333.txt|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p295_335.txt|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p295_336.txt|This time, however, may have been different.
p295_337.txt|We are well insured.
p295_338.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295_339.txt|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p295_340.txt|It's like a garage.
p295_341.txt|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p295_342.txt|I believe in public services.
p295_343.txt|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p295_344.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p295_345.txt|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p295_346.txt|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295_347.txt|Four years is a long time.
p295_348.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295_349.txt|No one wants to go through these things.
p295_350.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p295_351.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p295_352.txt|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p295_353.txt|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295_354.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p295_355.txt|He is very much in our thoughts.
p295_356.txt|So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_357.txt|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p295_358.txt|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p295_359.txt|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_360.txt|But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_361.txt|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295_362.txt|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_363.txt|You're not going to get hurt.
p295_364.txt|But no decision has been made.
p295_365.txt|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_366.txt|I decided not to renew the contract.
p295_367.txt|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p295_368.txt|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p295_369.txt|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p295_370.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p295_371.txt|She makes me feel very proud.
p295_372.txt|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295_373.txt|The voices told me to do it.
p295_374.txt|I am a committed European.
p295_375.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p295_376.txt|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295_377.txt|I'm astonished by this decision.
p295_378.txt|General, You didn't get a modified.
p295_379.txt|Surely the answer is yes.
p295_380.txt|It's part of your life.
p295_381.txt|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p295_382.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p295_383.txt|Our proposals are fully costed.
p295_384.txt|We all started running forward.
p295_385.txt|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p295_386.txt|That, however, is only part of the story.
p295_387.txt|It worked well in Monaco.
p295_388.txt|Things were not easy from the outset.
p295_389.txt|The team is in division one in Spain.
p295_390.txt|We don't even know his name.
p295_391.txt|Our position is not a logic of war.
p295_392.txt|I have played really well all year.
p295_393.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p295_394.txt|It was visibly on fire.
p295_395.txt|It was a fiery game.
p295_396.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p295_397.txt|That is European law.
p295_398.txt|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295_399.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p295_400.txt|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295_401.txt|That is not a position they enjoy.
p295_402.txt|Blair also had a penalty.
p295_403.txt|We wanted to run away with her.
p295_404.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p295_405.txt|I am not retiring.
p295_406.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295_407.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p295_408.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p295_409.txt|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295_410.txt|To me, it was just a miracle.
p295_411.txt|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p295_412.txt|That can happen so easily.
p295_413.txt|This is a really serious issue.
p295_414.txt|How do we get more people in?
p295_415.txt|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p295_416.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p295_418.txt|We suspect he was pleased.
p295_419.txt|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p295_420.txt|But, of course, it isn't.
p295_421.txt|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p295_422.txt|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p295_423.txt|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p295_424.txt|There is still the question of his health.
p297_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p297_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p297_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p297_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p297_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p297_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p297_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p297_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p297_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p297_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p297_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p297_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p297_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p297_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p297_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p297_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p297_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p297_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p297_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p297_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p297_025.txt|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p297_026.txt|We have gone on about him no end.
p297_027.txt|And the art of performance is taking risks.
p297_028.txt|Appointments should be made on merit.
p297_029.txt|I feel strongly about it.
p297_030.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p297_031.txt|I started on fire a couple of times.
p297_032.txt|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
p297_033.txt|Other forces were, however, at work.
p297_034.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p297_035.txt|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p297_036.txt|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p297_037.txt|My fitness was very poor.
p297_038.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p297_039.txt|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p297_040.txt|I am writing a novel.
p297_041.txt|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p297_042.txt|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p297_043.txt|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297_044.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p297_045.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p297_046.txt|Except for this, it was offside.
p297_047.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p297_048.txt|What do we do for an encore?
p297_049.txt|Things start to talk to each other.
p297_050.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p297_051.txt|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p297_052.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p297_053.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p297_054.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p297_055.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p297_056.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p297_057.txt|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p297_058.txt|You just have to accept.
p297_059.txt|People will see this over time.
p297_060.txt|The tribunal continues today.
p297_061.txt|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p297_062.txt|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297_063.txt|Nobody can get at them there.
p297_065.txt|It's not only my respect for them.
p297_066.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p297_067.txt|BIG Brother is listening to you.
p297_068.txt|We will be paying agency rates.
p297_069.txt|This is a very high price.
p297_070.txt|In the end, however, it all came together.
p297_071.txt|They can be time consuming.
p297_072.txt|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
p297_074.txt|Subtle it is not.
p297_075.txt|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p297_076.txt|I had a tie in my hand.
p297_077.txt|Raised the way you want it.
p297_078.txt|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p297_079.txt|Then he did it twice.
p297_080.txt|We were short of athletes.
p297_081.txt|You have to do your research.
p297_082.txt|Things were so intense in the studio.
p297_083.txt|Its first awards will do just that.
p297_084.txt|It was the crowning point of my career.
p297_085.txt|You could feel the heat.
p297_086.txt|She is still very poorly.
p297_087.txt|That's how she wants to remember him.
p297_088.txt|Do something that you haven't done before.
p297_090.txt|We talk about effective military action.
p297_091.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p297_092.txt|The scientific debate is dead.
p297_093.txt|I sincerely hope not.
p297_094.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p297_095.txt|There is no such thing.
p297_096.txt|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p297_097.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p297_098.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p297_099.txt|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p297_100.txt|The body follows the mind.
p297_101.txt|That gives it a spirit.
p297_102.txt|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p297_103.txt|However, what is his calibre?
p297_104.txt|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p297_105.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p297_106.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p297_107.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p297_108.txt|She died in middle age.
p297_109.txt|You need insurance to bring people in.
p297_110.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p297_111.txt|What was it like playing real people?
p297_112.txt|We are just being flooded.
p297_113.txt|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p297_114.txt|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p297_115.txt|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p297_116.txt|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p297_117.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p297_118.txt|It's too big a risk to take.
p297_119.txt|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p297_120.txt|Our lives have been turned upside down.
p297_121.txt|The General Election is all to play for.
p297_122.txt|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p297_123.txt|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p297_124.txt|United were in control without always being dominant.
p297_125.txt|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p297_126.txt|Which brings us to the question of money.
p297_127.txt|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p297_128.txt|It was my shortest audition.
p297_129.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p297_130.txt|It's unsafe for society.
p297_131.txt|Three penalties were given.
p297_132.txt|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p297_133.txt|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p297_134.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p297_135.txt|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p297_136.txt|We were extremely poor.
p297_137.txt|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
p297_138.txt|It was better than a soap opera.
p297_139.txt|It's not a great art.
p297_140.txt|She took them for a term.
p297_141.txt|It is easy to agree with him.
p297_142.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p297_143.txt|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p297_144.txt|It's my nature.
p297_145.txt|He was shocked by what he saw.
p297_146.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p297_147.txt|We had a really good experience with David.
p297_148.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p297_149.txt|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p297_150.txt|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p297_151.txt|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p297_152.txt|I will go out with him any time.
p297_153.txt|That's my big challenge.
p297_154.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p297_155.txt|They said we were out of touch.
p297_156.txt|My son was too young to die.
p297_157.txt|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p297_158.txt|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p297_159.txt|The captaincy will help that, too.
p297_160.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p297_161.txt|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p297_162.txt|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p297_163.txt|We meet again in Berlin.
p297_164.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p297_165.txt|Don't get me wrong.
p297_166.txt|He died from multiple injuries.
p297_167.txt|They would never let him go.
p297_168.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p297_169.txt|I'm going to buy a car.
p297_170.txt|Which is worse?
p297_171.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p297_172.txt|I'm not talking about his career.
p297_173.txt|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297_174.txt|But what lies ahead?
p297_175.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p297_176.txt|It was like the old days.
p297_177.txt|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p297_178.txt|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p297_179.txt|The first time you read a play.
p297_180.txt|We are committed to urgent action.
p297_181.txt|I wish him well.
p297_182.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p297_183.txt|I read it every year.
p297_184.txt|I think we've got the balance right.
p297_185.txt|There is no guarantee.
p297_186.txt|Some may end up in hospital.
p297_187.txt|I'll tell you honestly.
p297_188.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p297_189.txt|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p297_190.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p297_191.txt|Public safety is paramount.
p297_192.txt|We've never seen so many.
p297_193.txt|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p297_194.txt|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p297_195.txt|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p297_196.txt|I was just doing my job.
p297_197.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p297_198.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p297_199.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p297_200.txt|They tend to be female and retired.
p297_201.txt|I think it will make a huge difference.
p297_202.txt|We have a high quality product.
p297_203.txt|The home team also had their moments.
p297_204.txt|I have played well the past two days.
p297_205.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p297_206.txt|From day one, we were a family.
p297_207.txt|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297_208.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p297_209.txt|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p297_210.txt|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p297_211.txt|That's hard for a woman.
p297_212.txt|THE atmosphere was electric.
p297_213.txt|The boys are very confident.
p297_215.txt|This club have been fair to me.
p297_216.txt|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p297_217.txt|Access has been a nightmare.
p297_218.txt|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p297_219.txt|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p297_220.txt|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p297_221.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p297_222.txt|There has been no reaction from them.
p297_223.txt|She failed in her action.
p297_224.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p297_225.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p297_226.txt|The group will report back in the summer.
p297_227.txt|She looked so young.
p297_228.txt|I will let you in on a secret.
p297_229.txt|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p297_230.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p297_231.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p297_232.txt|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p297_233.txt|We need a visionary producer.
p297_234.txt|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p297_235.txt|Some were close to tears.
p297_236.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p297_237.txt|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p297_238.txt|He's a sort of mystery figure.
p297_239.txt|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
p297_240.txt|He just wants to leave a legacy.
p297_241.txt|Every game against New Zealand is.
p297_242.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p297_243.txt|But they didn't much like that.
p297_244.txt|We just wish they had done so before.
p297_245.txt|I am sorry to hear this news.
p297_246.txt|However we're capable of beating them.
p297_247.txt|They chose the latter.
p297_248.txt|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p297_249.txt|It's like a high school play.
p297_250.txt|That is how it will be judged.
p297_251.txt|It's there for people to look at.
p297_254.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p297_255.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p297_256.txt|However, we had no failures in our side.
p297_257.txt|This is his first movie.
p297_258.txt|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297_259.txt|They were assured that it would.
p297_260.txt|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p297_261.txt|She was charged with perjury.
p297_262.txt|With us, we just want them to respond.
p297_263.txt|But something has been lost in the translation.
p297_264.txt|That's the last thing they need.
p297_265.txt|I made a big mistake.
p297_266.txt|England against France is always a big game.
p297_267.txt|When he came to see me on Monday.
p297_268.txt|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p297_269.txt|The criteria have changed.
p297_270.txt|A new school will be built.
p297_271.txt|Who reminded him about the score?
p297_272.txt|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p297_273.txt|I will not walk away from this job.
p297_274.txt|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p297_275.txt|How do you find the youngsters?
p297_276.txt|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p297_277.txt|It does not move, which is amazing.
p297_278.txt|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p297_279.txt|Part of England, is not?
p297_280.txt|It may have been a cry for help.
p297_281.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p297_282.txt|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p297_283.txt|This is wrong, but that's believed.
p297_284.txt|They were not up to the required standard.
p297_285.txt|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p297_286.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p297_287.txt|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p297_288.txt|We want to replicate that success.
p297_289.txt|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p297_290.txt|Taxation should be simplified.
p297_291.txt|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297_292.txt|He looked at me before replying.
p297_293.txt|But today was the real big one.
p297_294.txt|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297_295.txt|That idea is rubbish.
p297_296.txt|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p297_297.txt|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p297_298.txt|After that, we made some changes.
p297_299.txt|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p297_300.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p297_301.txt|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p297_302.txt|I want my audience to be challenged.
p297_303.txt|It was quite a new prescription.
p297_304.txt|That, too, was over two years ago.
p297_305.txt|Who do you think you are?
p297_306.txt|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p297_307.txt|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p297_308.txt|I can understand why they have gone.
p297_309.txt|They will give it a couple of years.
p297_310.txt|Your father was a good man.
p297_311.txt|Bob Dylan's getting old.
p297_312.txt|Our number one goal is prevention.
p297_313.txt|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p297_314.txt|And he is immensely loyal.
p297_315.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p297_316.txt|But there was no time for that.
p297_317.txt|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297_318.txt|I am not against a further inquiry.
p297_319.txt|The company's in good shape.
p297_320.txt|There are different cultures in different departments.
p297_321.txt|He was caught and fired.
p297_322.txt|I was pregnant and very worried.
p297_323.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p297_324.txt|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297_325.txt|It's only tackling congestion.
p297_326.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p297_327.txt|You will never replace the child.
p297_328.txt|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
p297_329.txt|Off with their heads.
p297_330.txt|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p297_331.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p297_332.txt|The way ahead is not easy.
p297_333.txt|He intends to appeal the sentences.
p297_334.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p297_335.txt|His primary residence is Scotland.
p297_336.txt|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p297_337.txt|You are going to take away my life.
p297_338.txt|That was one very hard game.
p297_339.txt|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p297_340.txt|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p297_341.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p297_342.txt|Don't hold your breath.
p297_343.txt|The girls are ready to compete.
p297_344.txt|O, Is there anything in the wound?
p297_345.txt|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p297_346.txt|It was blown out of proportion.
p297_347.txt|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p297_348.txt|Surely it can do better than that?
p297_349.txt|It was all too little, too late.
p297_350.txt|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p297_351.txt|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p297_352.txt|It is only one night, after all.
p297_353.txt|The professor said the results were positive.
p297_354.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p297_355.txt|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p297_356.txt|The course record was in his name.
p297_357.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p297_358.txt|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p297_359.txt|It's easy to see why.
p297_360.txt|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p297_361.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p297_362.txt|He had lost his confidence again.
p297_363.txt|So, where do we go from here?
p297_364.txt|I was never alone with her, right?
p297_365.txt|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p297_366.txt|I think we'll just keep it.
p297_367.txt|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p297_368.txt|It has proved a double whammy.
p297_369.txt|We make good weapons.
p297_370.txt|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p297_371.txt|What has changed?
p297_372.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p297_373.txt|It's like English in its underwear.
p297_374.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p297_375.txt|This is the same old story.
p297_376.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p297_377.txt|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
p297_378.txt|They finished second and third.
p297_379.txt|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p297_380.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p297_381.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p297_382.txt|I don't want a burial service.
p297_383.txt|And it's time for new leadership.
p297_384.txt|I'm not sure.
p297_385.txt|One might think that is a power.
p297_386.txt|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p297_387.txt|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p297_388.txt|We have big ideas.
p297_389.txt|I hope the voters will respond.
p297_390.txt|And who would argue with that?
p297_391.txt|I believe that gap is nearly there.
p297_392.txt|This is the real thing now.
p297_393.txt|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p297_394.txt|I ran to get out of the way.
p297_395.txt|It was to be published next month.
p297_396.txt|It's not a party, no, no.
p297_397.txt|We have understood the problems for some time.
p297_398.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p297_399.txt|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p297_400.txt|She now lives in London.
p297_401.txt|But every country has its own character.
p297_402.txt|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p297_403.txt|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297_404.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p297_405.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p297_406.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p297_407.txt|One policeman was killed.
p297_408.txt|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p297_409.txt|My heart is not so sure.
p297_410.txt|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p297_411.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p297_412.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p297_413.txt|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297_414.txt|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p297_415.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p297_416.txt|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p297_417.txt|This is his personal life.
p297_418.txt|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297_419.txt|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297_420.txt|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p297_421.txt|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
p297_422.txt|It's a true story.
p297_423.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p297_424.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p298_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p298_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p298_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p298_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p298_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p298_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p298_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p298_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p298_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p298_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p298_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p298_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p298_025.txt|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p298_026.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p298_027.txt|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p298_028.txt|That is just a load of baloney.
p298_029.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p298_030.txt|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p298_031.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p298_032.txt|The feeling is marvellous.
p298_033.txt|I think they should have more respect.
p298_034.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p298_035.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p298_036.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p298_037.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p298_038.txt|It was a crucial moment.
p298_039.txt|We gave everything we had.
p298_040.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p298_041.txt|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p298_042.txt|His charisma is all on the course.
p298_043.txt|This is purely financial.
p298_044.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p298_045.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
p298_046.txt|I did not want any damage to us.
p298_047.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p298_048.txt|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p298_049.txt|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p298_050.txt|I saw them not long after it happened.
p298_051.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p298_052.txt|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p298_053.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p298_054.txt|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p298_055.txt|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p298_056.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p298_057.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p298_058.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p298_059.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p298_060.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p298_061.txt|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p298_062.txt|Don't say you have not been warned.
p298_063.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p298_064.txt|Seven children had lost both parents.
p298_065.txt|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p298_066.txt|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p298_067.txt|Most people know that.
p298_068.txt|Some people still think she should be English.
p298_069.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p298_070.txt|Repayment is not part of the game.
p298_071.txt|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p298_072.txt|What do they pay to join the club?
p298_073.txt|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298_074.txt|We are now in a safe place.
p298_075.txt|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298_076.txt|It will be very useful for us.
p298_077.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p298_078.txt|We just try to make great records.
p298_079.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p298_080.txt|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p298_081.txt|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p298_082.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p298_083.txt|His parenthood is called into question.
p298_084.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p298_085.txt|We really need research to help with that.
p298_086.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p298_087.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p298_088.txt|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p298_089.txt|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p298_090.txt|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p298_091.txt|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p298_092.txt|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p298_093.txt|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p298_094.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p298_095.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p298_096.txt|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p298_097.txt|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p298_098.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p298_099.txt|Their vision was not impeded.
p298_100.txt|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p298_101.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p298_102.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p298_103.txt|He went to see what he could learn.
p298_104.txt|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p298_105.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p298_106.txt|The luxury has been well used.
p298_107.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p298_108.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p298_109.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p298_110.txt|There was no time scale.
p298_111.txt|Only the scale of change differed.
p298_112.txt|Tell you the team he picked?
p298_113.txt|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p298_114.txt|The cold war is over.
p298_115.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p298_116.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p298_117.txt|And it's more subversive.
p298_118.txt|We are losing this war.
p298_119.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p298_120.txt|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p298_121.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p298_122.txt|I've got no secret.
p298_123.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p298_124.txt|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p298_125.txt|I asked why he had come.
p298_126.txt|Will they ever reopen?
p298_127.txt|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p298_128.txt|A lot of people were in tears.
p298_129.txt|We have great team spirit.
p298_130.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p298_131.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p298_132.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p298_133.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p298_134.txt|We have big ideas.
p298_135.txt|I first met him last summer.
p298_136.txt|It was to be published next month.
p298_137.txt|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p298_138.txt|It could have been a hammering by now.
p298_139.txt|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p298_140.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p298_141.txt|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p298_142.txt|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p298_143.txt|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p298_144.txt|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p298_145.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p298_146.txt|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p298_147.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p298_148.txt|All kinds of things occur.
p298_149.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p298_150.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p298_151.txt|It is always the same, isn't it?
p298_152.txt|Who would take it now, after all this?
p298_153.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p298_154.txt|That gives us something to kick against.
p298_155.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p298_156.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p298_157.txt|There is precious little middle ground.
p298_158.txt|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p298_159.txt|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p298_160.txt|They were both delightful to work with.
p298_161.txt|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p298_162.txt|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p298_163.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p298_164.txt|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p298_165.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p298_166.txt|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p298_167.txt|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p298_168.txt|Can they be serious?
p298_169.txt|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p298_170.txt|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p298_171.txt|It's just that we see different things.
p298_172.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p298_173.txt|We are all family men with children.
p298_174.txt|I think we showed that after half time.
p298_175.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p298_176.txt|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p298_177.txt|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p298_178.txt|You let a lot of people down.
p298_179.txt|One person was believed to have been hit.
p298_180.txt|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p298_181.txt|We aren't going to play better.
p298_182.txt|They just would not have run away.
p298_183.txt|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p298_184.txt|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p298_185.txt|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p298_186.txt|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p298_187.txt|Our people should be immune.
p298_188.txt|Glasgow then took control.
p298_189.txt|It is simple and easy to use.
p298_190.txt|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p298_191.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p298_192.txt|I think we finished fifth.
p298_193.txt|It was not a foul.
p298_194.txt|We know them as mobile telephones.
p298_195.txt|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p298_196.txt|I don't know exactly what happened.
p298_197.txt|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p298_198.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p298_199.txt|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p298_200.txt|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p298_201.txt|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p298_202.txt|I am not a happy man.
p298_203.txt|You can be sure we will have problems.
p298_204.txt|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p298_205.txt|I'm going with all three.
p298_206.txt|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p298_207.txt|The line-up is a tasty one.
p298_208.txt|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p298_209.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p298_210.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p298_211.txt|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p298_212.txt|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p298_213.txt|They should also have the right to vote.
p298_214.txt|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p298_215.txt|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
p298_216.txt|People are so negative about the whole business.
p298_217.txt|They had given up on him.
p298_218.txt|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p298_219.txt|It has made me feel good.
p298_220.txt|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p298_221.txt|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p298_222.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p298_223.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p298_224.txt|I was living with my mum.
p298_225.txt|It did my image a lot of good!
p298_226.txt|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p298_227.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p298_228.txt|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p298_229.txt|But there has never been the time, she said.
p298_230.txt|This could be one such case, he declared.
p298_231.txt|I fell in love with ballet.
p298_232.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p298_233.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p298_234.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p298_235.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p298_236.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p298_237.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p298_238.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p298_239.txt|I think in three dimensions.
p298_240.txt|They had four children together.
p298_241.txt|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p298_242.txt|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p298_243.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p298_244.txt|All were later allowed home.
p298_245.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p298_246.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p298_247.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p298_248.txt|It is the end of an era.
p298_249.txt|We can just get on with our game.
p298_250.txt|But first it goes out on TV.
p298_251.txt|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p298_252.txt|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p298_253.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p298_254.txt|I learned a lot from her.
p298_255.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p298_256.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p298_257.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p298_258.txt|They have a very good method of working.
p298_259.txt|Do you think you have a shot?
p298_260.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p298_261.txt|Things were not easy from the outset.
p298_262.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p298_263.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p298_264.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p298_265.txt|I've seen some of the submissions.
p298_266.txt|There is no such thing.
p298_267.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p298_268.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p298_269.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p298_270.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p298_271.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p298_272.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p298_273.txt|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
p298_274.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p298_275.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p298_276.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p298_277.txt|Last year, however, was a different story.
p298_278.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p298_279.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p298_280.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p298_281.txt|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p298_282.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p298_283.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p298_284.txt|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p298_285.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p298_286.txt|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p298_287.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p298_288.txt|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p298_289.txt|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p298_290.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p298_291.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p298_292.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p298_293.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p298_294.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p298_295.txt|And that was the adults.
p298_296.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p298_297.txt|That is a job for the Government.
p298_298.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p298_299.txt|And he had much need.
p298_300.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p298_301.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p298_302.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p298_303.txt|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p298_304.txt|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p298_305.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p298_306.txt|Some have other commitments.
p298_307.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p298_308.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p298_309.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p298_310.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p298_311.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p298_312.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p298_313.txt|Rapid revision was required.
p298_314.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p298_315.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p298_316.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p298_317.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p298_318.txt|We have grown up in Britain.
p298_319.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p298_320.txt|I am proud of those guys.
p298_321.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p298_322.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p298_323.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p298_324.txt|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p298_325.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p298_326.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p298_327.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p298_328.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p298_329.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p298_330.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p298_331.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p298_332.txt|I have a theory.
p298_333.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p298_334.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p298_335.txt|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p298_336.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p298_337.txt|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p298_338.txt|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p298_339.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p298_340.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p298_341.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p298_342.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p298_343.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p298_344.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p298_345.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p298_346.txt|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p298_347.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p298_348.txt|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p298_349.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p298_350.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p298_351.txt|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p298_352.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p298_353.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p298_354.txt|He saw it all as a big game.
p298_355.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p298_356.txt|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p298_357.txt|I would urge the Government to think again.
p298_358.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p298_359.txt|I was happiest with my short game.
p298_360.txt|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p298_361.txt|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p298_362.txt|As if he were a High Court judge.
p298_363.txt|Would he be able to live with that?
p298_364.txt|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p298_365.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p298_366.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p298_367.txt|And a film maker was born.
p298_368.txt|It was also put on the Internet.
p298_369.txt|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p298_370.txt|Now that was a boxing movie.
p298_371.txt|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p298_372.txt|There was a battle there.
p298_373.txt|I might also completely change the routine.
p298_374.txt|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p298_375.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p298_376.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p298_377.txt|I have learned a lot from him.
p298_378.txt|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p298_379.txt|I have beaten her a few times.
p298_380.txt|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p298_381.txt|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p298_382.txt|We are being hijacked.
p298_383.txt|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p298_384.txt|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p298_385.txt|This is the first stage of catching up.
p298_386.txt|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p298_387.txt|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p298_388.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p298_389.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p298_390.txt|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p298_391.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p298_392.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p298_393.txt|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p298_394.txt|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p298_395.txt|I am just looking to God.
p298_396.txt|The woman is basically off her head.
p298_397.txt|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p298_398.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p298_399.txt|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p298_400.txt|The South African defended his work ethic.
p298_401.txt|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p298_402.txt|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p298_403.txt|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p298_404.txt|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p298_405.txt|He showed he has some things to learn.
p299_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p299_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p299_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p299_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p299_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p299_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p299_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p299_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p299_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p299_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p299_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p299_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p299_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p299_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p299_025.txt|I just went for it over the weekend.
p299_026.txt|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299_027.txt|It is only one night, after all.
p299_028.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p299_029.txt|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299_030.txt|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p299_031.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p299_032.txt|It's easy to see why.
p299_033.txt|I am proud of moments like that.
p299_034.txt|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_035.txt|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299_036.txt|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p299_037.txt|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p299_038.txt|This is a big advantage.
p299_039.txt|I think we have a very strong case.
p299_040.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p299_041.txt|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p299_042.txt|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299_043.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p299_044.txt|Today is not about contracts.
p299_045.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p299_046.txt|That says something for his strength of character.
p299_047.txt|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299_048.txt|It's to do with play.
p299_049.txt|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p299_050.txt|I've just got to do this.
p299_051.txt|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299_052.txt|That was the problem.
p299_053.txt|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_054.txt|I have been here for only three months.
p299_055.txt|Everything else is second.
p299_056.txt|I think it is a sensible change.
p299_057.txt|Sex is fun?
p299_058.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p299_059.txt|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p299_060.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p299_061.txt|We hope this scheme will change that.
p299_062.txt|It was created by genocide.
p299_063.txt|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p299_064.txt|How could anyone take issue with that?
p299_065.txt|He takes time out for everyone.
p299_066.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_067.txt|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p299_068.txt|A number of people could not speak English.
p299_069.txt|They have got off with murder.
p299_070.txt|They had had time for little else.
p299_071.txt|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_072.txt|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p299_073.txt|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p299_074.txt|The settlement could run to millions.
p299_075.txt|It does not stop at the border.
p299_076.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p299_077.txt|How can they say that?
p299_078.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p299_079.txt|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299_080.txt|She added, It is a huge problem.
p299_081.txt|You can't keep them separate.
p299_082.txt|I still feel like a wee boy.
p299_083.txt|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p299_084.txt|But there was a shift.
p299_085.txt|Israel has done very little until now.
p299_086.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p299_087.txt|We are losing this war.
p299_088.txt|A decision is expected today.
p299_089.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p299_090.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p299_091.txt|There is a growing anger among the group.
p299_092.txt|We certainly will need to watch him.
p299_093.txt|I don't think it could be clearer.
p299_094.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p299_095.txt|Our offer will remain on the table.
p299_096.txt|We are trying to establish a date.
p299_097.txt|He is a man who lives to work.
p299_098.txt|The website is now being amended.
p299_099.txt|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p299_100.txt|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p299_101.txt|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299_102.txt|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_103.txt|He had a heart problem.
p299_104.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p299_105.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p299_106.txt|That was the light relief.
p299_107.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p299_108.txt|He has one son and one daughter.
p299_109.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p299_110.txt|That, he claimed, was essential.
p299_111.txt|I have great respect for all my players.
p299_112.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p299_113.txt|He had other things on his mind.
p299_114.txt|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p299_115.txt|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p299_116.txt|The next few months will tell.
p299_117.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p299_118.txt|It is crucial for both teams.
p299_119.txt|I am happy with my form.
p299_120.txt|You can see their point.
p299_121.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p299_122.txt|They married in August last year.
p299_123.txt|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p299_124.txt|Yet he chose to do something different.
p299_125.txt|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p299_126.txt|There were no casualties.
p299_127.txt|I've just got to build on this now.
p299_128.txt|I was pleased with my own game.
p299_129.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p299_130.txt|They really did a great job.
p299_131.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p299_132.txt|Where is the anthrax?
p299_133.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p299_134.txt|I love you so very much.
p299_135.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p299_136.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p299_137.txt|They can be time consuming.
p299_138.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p299_139.txt|I had a tie in my hand.
p299_140.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p299_141.txt|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p299_142.txt|Such a city does not exist.
p299_143.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p299_144.txt|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p299_145.txt|This has a number of benefits.
p299_146.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p299_147.txt|That is in the very nature of farming.
p299_148.txt|These matters are now behind us.
p299_149.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p299_150.txt|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p299_151.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p299_152.txt|It was then into overtime.
p299_153.txt|Most of the public are behind me.
p299_154.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p299_155.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p299_156.txt|I am still very much a director.
p299_157.txt|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p299_158.txt|But we are severely limited in funds.
p299_159.txt|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p299_160.txt|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
p299_161.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p299_162.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p299_163.txt|Of course he is.
p299_164.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p299_165.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p299_166.txt|And does it?
p299_167.txt|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p299_168.txt|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p299_169.txt|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p299_170.txt|She is a very lucky lady.
p299_171.txt|Was it a foul?
p299_172.txt|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p299_173.txt|We've been there for seven years.
p299_174.txt|He was as good as his word.
p299_175.txt|Promises were not kept.
p299_176.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p299_177.txt|His signature is his handwriting.
p299_178.txt|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299_179.txt|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p299_180.txt|It's not in my nature.
p299_181.txt|You see - this business is a good one.
p299_182.txt|Who is he?
p299_183.txt|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299_184.txt|Our members are concerned about their futures.
p299_185.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p299_186.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p299_187.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p299_188.txt|It worked, up to a point.
p299_189.txt|There was no rescue.
p299_190.txt|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p299_191.txt|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p299_192.txt|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p299_193.txt|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p299_194.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p299_195.txt|We've got a great defensive club.
p299_196.txt|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p299_197.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p299_198.txt|I feel privileged to be here.
p299_199.txt|I'm not afraid of that.
p299_200.txt|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p299_201.txt|She told me to apply for the crest.
p299_202.txt|He explained to his audience.
p299_203.txt|I think the Government should pay for that.
p299_204.txt|I never made any offer to Mark.
p299_205.txt|The actors are confident and polished.
p299_206.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p299_207.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p299_208.txt|I'm a bit annoyed.
p299_209.txt|On that they agree.
p299_210.txt|I just could not cope.
p299_211.txt|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p299_212.txt|It is all one-sided.
p299_213.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p299_214.txt|Here are some possible solutions.
p299_215.txt|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299_216.txt|They were both very brave.
p299_217.txt|He made so many bad decisions.
p299_218.txt|We are now up against it.
p299_219.txt|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p299_220.txt|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p299_221.txt|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p299_222.txt|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p299_223.txt|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p299_224.txt|But the row refused to go away.
p299_225.txt|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p299_226.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p299_227.txt|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299_228.txt|This must be really short of ideas.
p299_229.txt|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p299_230.txt|I believe you may be that person.
p299_231.txt|It was a big day.
p299_232.txt|What makes a house a home?
p299_233.txt|I think however, he was having a fit!
p299_234.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p299_235.txt|I will not be pressured.
p299_236.txt|I had another good day.
p299_237.txt|I hate the word.
p299_238.txt|We should be trying to keep him in.
p299_239.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p299_240.txt|I would say so.
p299_241.txt|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p299_242.txt|I was the only one arguing differently.
p299_243.txt|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p299_244.txt|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p299_245.txt|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p299_246.txt|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p299_247.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p299_248.txt|It was a tactical change.
p299_249.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p299_250.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p299_251.txt|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p299_252.txt|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p299_253.txt|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p299_254.txt|One of these problems is the railways.
p299_255.txt|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p299_256.txt|We don't have the credible evidence.
p299_257.txt|It's one up to the Scots.
p299_258.txt|I'm just doing artwork.
p299_259.txt|He is a right bastard.
p299_260.txt|I don't want to use the term.
p299_261.txt|And we still have to pay his salary.
p299_262.txt|Also, he was flawed.
p299_263.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p299_264.txt|So there's a double whammy.
p299_265.txt|I didn't have a trio.
p299_266.txt|Their three other children had died as infants.
p299_267.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p299_268.txt|She is a great talent.
p299_269.txt|I hope my successor will do the same.
p299_270.txt|I learned that only yesterday.
p299_271.txt|We do things in an appropriate way.
p299_272.txt|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p299_273.txt|Are you in this movie?
p299_274.txt|We have got a full house tonight.
p299_275.txt|The things writers and directors say!
p299_276.txt|The fans will support us.
p299_277.txt|Is this new report the answer?
p299_278.txt|It was a long process, but we got there.
p299_279.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p299_280.txt|We need to be looking to the future.
p299_281.txt|The whole team was rubbish.
p299_282.txt|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p299_283.txt|Some of the players have not progressed.
p299_284.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p299_285.txt|You've got it coming Kabul.
p299_286.txt|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p299_287.txt|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p299_288.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p299_289.txt|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p299_290.txt|Are his works inside out?
p299_291.txt|There is a cup final at stake.
p299_292.txt|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p299_293.txt|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p299_294.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p299_295.txt|I am not a free trader.
p299_296.txt|There were so many characters among them.
p299_297.txt|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299_298.txt|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p299_299.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p299_300.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p299_301.txt|Now there's an even bigger target.
p299_302.txt|They were the better side on the day.
p299_303.txt|No decision on that was taken.
p299_304.txt|What went wrong?
p299_305.txt|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p299_306.txt|They chose to side with terror.
p299_307.txt|This must have been severe.
p299_308.txt|We're all in a state of shock.
p299_309.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p299_310.txt|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p299_311.txt|We are in a learning curve.
p299_312.txt|Why should we have been asked to share?
p299_313.txt|He was released in March this year.
p299_314.txt|She was just that sort of person.
p299_315.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p299_316.txt|Instead, she just went away.
p299_317.txt|I've seen some of the submissions.
p299_318.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p299_319.txt|It was chaotic and frightening.
p299_320.txt|I think in three dimensions.
p299_321.txt|It is a question of balance.
p299_322.txt|Soon the whole country will be level.
p299_323.txt|He's very young but he is growing up.
p299_324.txt|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p299_325.txt|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p299_326.txt|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p299_327.txt|We could not have asked for any more.
p299_328.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p299_329.txt|People might not actually want the job.
p299_330.txt|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p299_331.txt|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p299_332.txt|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p299_333.txt|I have a bunch of veterans.
p299_334.txt|I am not retiring.
p299_335.txt|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p299_336.txt|The package has been properly costed.
p299_337.txt|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p299_338.txt|We will work through the night.
p299_339.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p299_340.txt|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p299_341.txt|We just need the Government to act.
p299_342.txt|The urgency is real.
p299_343.txt|The criminal justice system does not do that.
p299_344.txt|He will never walk the streets again.
p299_345.txt|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p299_346.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p299_347.txt|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p299_348.txt|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299_349.txt|I can't stop people thinking.
p299_350.txt|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p299_351.txt|That's the last thing he will do.
p299_352.txt|I have not been so angry for years.
p299_353.txt|I am ready for that.
p299_354.txt|Do you mean today?
p299_355.txt|This is normal for him now.
p299_356.txt|But my heart is in athletics.
p299_357.txt|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p299_358.txt|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p299_359.txt|Yet he left a few days later.
p299_360.txt|The place became a war zone.
p299_361.txt|What's happening to her?
p299_362.txt|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p299_363.txt|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p299_364.txt|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p299_365.txt|I don't have a new house.
p299_366.txt|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p299_367.txt|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p299_368.txt|Horses have some sense.
p299_369.txt|The plot is minimal.
p299_370.txt|See it while you can.
p299_371.txt|The plane was in flames
p299_372.txt|But then, that really is the point.
p299_373.txt|One policeman was killed.
p299_374.txt|I didn't do too badly myself.
p299_375.txt|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p299_376.txt|We have been working together for some years.
p299_377.txt|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p299_378.txt|He has never even been to Ireland.
p299_379.txt|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p299_380.txt|Do what you have to do.
p299_381.txt|I'm getting back up there now.
p299_382.txt|We believe the squad will stay together.
p299_383.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p299_384.txt|There is a lot of anger.
p299_385.txt|We suspect he was pleased.
p299_386.txt|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p299_387.txt|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p299_388.txt|She always wanted her own way.
p299_389.txt|Maybe, who knows?
p299_390.txt|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p299_391.txt|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299_392.txt|It was a sell-out.
p299_393.txt|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
p299_394.txt|If there is default.
p299_395.txt|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p299_396.txt|I'll take what comes along.
p299_397.txt|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p299_398.txt|She will just have wanted her baby.
p299_399.txt|Scotland is losing business.
p299_400.txt|We are working on the two things.
p299_401.txt|We only lost the third goal.
p299_402.txt|Women reported more depression than men.
p299_403.txt|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p299_404.txt|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p299_405.txt|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p300_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p300_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p300_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p300_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p300_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p300_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p300_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p300_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p300_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p300_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p300_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p300_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p300_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p300_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p300_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p300_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p300_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p300_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p300_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p300_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p300_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p300_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p300_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p300_025.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p300_026.txt|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p300_027.txt|It is not an amnesty.
p300_028.txt|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p300_029.txt|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p300_030.txt|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p300_031.txt|I don't believe you own anything.
p300_032.txt|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p300_033.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p300_034.txt|Blood samples have been taken.
p300_035.txt|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p300_036.txt|He said he now intends to fly today.
p300_037.txt|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300_038.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p300_039.txt|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300_040.txt|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p300_041.txt|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300_042.txt|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p300_043.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p300_044.txt|We like being the underdogs.
p300_045.txt|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300_046.txt|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p300_047.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p300_048.txt|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300_049.txt|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300_050.txt|Except for this, it was offside.
p300_051.txt|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p300_052.txt|It's a grey area.
p300_053.txt|Retirement, who knows?
p300_054.txt|He was shocked by what he saw.
p300_055.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p300_056.txt|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p300_057.txt|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p300_058.txt|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p300_059.txt|He was taken ill in December last year.
p300_060.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p300_061.txt|It's all too short term.
p300_062.txt|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p300_063.txt|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300_064.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p300_065.txt|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p300_066.txt|He also does not get along with Christina.
p300_067.txt|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p300_068.txt|How things have changed since then.
p300_069.txt|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300_070.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p300_071.txt|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p300_072.txt|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p300_073.txt|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p300_074.txt|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p300_075.txt|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p300_076.txt|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p300_077.txt|You'd think there was a match on today.
p300_078.txt|We must move on.
p300_079.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p300_080.txt|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p300_081.txt|His options are severely limited.
p300_082.txt|This is truly field of miracles.
p300_083.txt|They are not an item.
p300_084.txt|Why did they let him go?
p300_085.txt|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p300_086.txt|I have made good progress.
p300_087.txt|We do need a new one.
p300_088.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p300_089.txt|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p300_090.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p300_091.txt|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p300_092.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p300_093.txt|But the relief was short-lived.
p300_094.txt|You had better believe it.
p300_095.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p300_096.txt|He told us about it the next day.
p300_097.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p300_098.txt|There are a huge number of arts.
p300_099.txt|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p300_100.txt|My office is bare.
p300_101.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p300_102.txt|Where is the anthrax?
p300_103.txt|Housing is in very short supply.
p300_104.txt|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p300_105.txt|People just came on their own.
p300_106.txt|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p300_107.txt|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p300_108.txt|You either have him or you don't.
p300_109.txt|There are some new buildings in there.
p300_110.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p300_111.txt|I'm not a diva.
p300_112.txt|There is great relief at this point.
p300_113.txt|Look at them after three days of rain.
p300_114.txt|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p300_115.txt|There is no point in pushing it.
p300_116.txt|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p300_117.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p300_118.txt|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p300_119.txt|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p300_120.txt|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p300_121.txt|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300_122.txt|I will speak to Michael about this.
p300_123.txt|This is not understood by people outside.
p300_124.txt|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p300_125.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p300_126.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p300_127.txt|I went straight to the toilet.
p300_128.txt|She says the royal family get on well.
p300_129.txt|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p300_130.txt|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p300_131.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p300_132.txt|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p300_133.txt|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p300_134.txt|There is still much work to be done.
p300_135.txt|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p300_136.txt|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p300_137.txt|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p300_138.txt|We were with him the whole time.
p300_139.txt|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p300_140.txt|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300_141.txt|That's because we work hard at it.
p300_142.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p300_143.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p300_144.txt|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p300_145.txt|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p300_146.txt|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p300_147.txt|We need a new kind of theatre.
p300_148.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p300_149.txt|I feel my life to be at risk.
p300_150.txt|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p300_151.txt|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p300_152.txt|We came across the first set of bodies.
p300_153.txt|We need some confidence to get a win.
p300_154.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p300_155.txt|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p300_156.txt|This is a foolish idea.
p300_157.txt|You might even have seen him.
p300_158.txt|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p300_159.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p300_160.txt|She collapsed and died a day later.
p300_161.txt|You should be there with six different characters.
p300_162.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p300_163.txt|I took a minibus into town.
p300_164.txt|I do my job.
p300_165.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p300_166.txt|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p300_167.txt|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p300_168.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p300_169.txt|Who do these people think they are?
p300_170.txt|What has caused the demise of singing?
p300_171.txt|We want to help them through it.
p300_172.txt|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p300_173.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p300_174.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p300_175.txt|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p300_176.txt|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300_177.txt|It shows that we are civilised society.
p300_178.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p300_179.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p300_180.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p300_181.txt|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p300_182.txt|She is living proof of their expertise.
p300_183.txt|This one was my best chance.
p300_184.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p300_185.txt|I am writing a novel.
p300_186.txt|A bit of match fitness is required.
p300_187.txt|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p300_188.txt|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p300_189.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p300_190.txt|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p300_191.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p300_192.txt|These elements are not in the book.
p300_193.txt|You look at them and you understand.
p300_194.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p300_195.txt|I would like Glasgow.
p300_196.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p300_197.txt|We have only nine months to go.
p300_198.txt|Both of them have looked good.
p300_199.txt|I like footballers who play well.
p300_200.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p300_201.txt|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p300_202.txt|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p300_203.txt|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p300_204.txt|Donald was a man with many friends.
p300_205.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p300_206.txt|It is turning that way all across Europe.
p300_207.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p300_208.txt|We were on top and could've won.
p300_209.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p300_210.txt|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p300_211.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p300_212.txt|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p300_213.txt|It is like being a qualifier again.
p300_214.txt|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p300_215.txt|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p300_216.txt|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p300_217.txt|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p300_218.txt|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p300_219.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p300_220.txt|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p300_221.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p300_222.txt|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p300_223.txt|She didn't tell us anything new.
p300_224.txt|There is nothing like this back home.
p300_225.txt|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p300_226.txt|I found a fault and it worked at it.
p300_227.txt|It was a poor performance.
p300_228.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p300_229.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p300_230.txt|This is all part of opening the door.
p300_231.txt|We have tried to keep his head up.
p300_232.txt|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p300_233.txt|He will become the sovereign.
p300_234.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p300_235.txt|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p300_236.txt|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p300_237.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p300_238.txt|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p300_239.txt|It's just gotten too big.
p300_240.txt|Was all this really just five months ago?
p300_241.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p300_242.txt|They were two different types.
p300_243.txt|It need not be like that.
p300_244.txt|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p300_245.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p300_246.txt|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p300_247.txt|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p300_248.txt|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p300_249.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p300_250.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p300_251.txt|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p300_252.txt|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p300_253.txt|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p300_254.txt|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p300_255.txt|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p300_256.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p300_257.txt|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p300_258.txt|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p300_259.txt|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p300_260.txt|He must have something up his sleeve.
p300_261.txt|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p300_262.txt|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p300_263.txt|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p300_264.txt|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p300_265.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p300_266.txt|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p300_267.txt|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p300_268.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p300_269.txt|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p300_270.txt|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p300_271.txt|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p300_272.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p300_273.txt|The board has rejected her proposals.
p300_274.txt|It does not move, which is amazing.
p300_275.txt|She is a very lucky young lady.
p300_276.txt|The threat to rural areas is real.
p300_277.txt|Tourism continues to struggle.
p300_278.txt|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p300_279.txt|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p300_280.txt|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p300_281.txt|This is a great shame.
p300_282.txt|That was merely their initial problem.
p300_283.txt|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p300_284.txt|We said, What do you mean?
p300_285.txt|I need them to set my career.
p300_286.txt|The law will take its course.
p300_287.txt|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p300_288.txt|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p300_289.txt|The fund has three elements.
p300_290.txt|This is still a young team, you know.
p300_291.txt|It's not even finished.
p300_292.txt|Everyone knew where they were.
p300_293.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p300_294.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p300_295.txt|People will make up their own minds.
p300_296.txt|After that he became more romantic.
p300_297.txt|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p300_298.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p300_299.txt|They finished second and third.
p300_300.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p300_301.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p300_302.txt|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p300_303.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p300_304.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p300_305.txt|People can get them if they want.
p300_306.txt|Their message was simple.
p300_307.txt|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p300_308.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p300_309.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p300_310.txt|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p300_311.txt|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300_312.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p300_313.txt|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p300_314.txt|It is just completely erased.
p300_315.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p300_316.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p300_317.txt|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p300_318.txt|Too often it is not.
p300_319.txt|I tend not to look back.
p300_320.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p300_321.txt|I got a yellow card.
p300_322.txt|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p300_323.txt|I don't know what he was capable of.
p300_324.txt|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300_325.txt|It's good to start with Judith.
p300_326.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p300_327.txt|It may also be her last.
p300_328.txt|Maybe it helps us.
p300_329.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p300_330.txt|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p300_331.txt|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p300_332.txt|He made no big mistakes.
p300_333.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p300_334.txt|We will be homeless.
p300_335.txt|I believe he can do a better job.
p300_336.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p300_337.txt|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300_338.txt|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p300_339.txt|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p300_340.txt|Well, was it?
p300_341.txt|We won't let you down.
p300_342.txt|What kind of person is he?
p300_343.txt|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p300_344.txt|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p300_345.txt|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p300_346.txt|English is the language of pop music.
p300_347.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300_348.txt|It is a simple equation.
p300_349.txt|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p300_350.txt|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p300_351.txt|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p300_352.txt|Who has the second highest?
p300_354.txt|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p300_355.txt|I didn't even have the first idea.
p300_356.txt|No person was charged.
p300_357.txt|I've only met him three times.
p300_358.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p300_359.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p300_360.txt|She looked very, very poor.
p300_361.txt|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p300_362.txt|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p300_363.txt|This is not great, but it goes well.
p300_364.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p300_365.txt|Both are national treasures.
p300_366.txt|And here is the rub.
p300_367.txt|They are also exploited by the markets.
p300_368.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p300_369.txt|I am really looking forward to it.
p300_370.txt|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p300_371.txt|This takes the pressure off.
p300_372.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p300_373.txt|I will never get over his death.
p300_374.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p300_375.txt|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p300_376.txt|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p300_377.txt|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p300_378.txt|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p300_379.txt|They should have some measure of protection.
p300_380.txt|They did not threaten anyone.
p300_381.txt|Who is going to pay their wages?
p300_382.txt|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p300_383.txt|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p300_384.txt|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p300_385.txt|That's the kind of thing that counts.
p300_386.txt|Construction would then begin.
p300_387.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p300_388.txt|A century on, little has changed.
p300_389.txt|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p300_390.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p300_391.txt|Form and structure are his music.
p300_392.txt|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
p300_393.txt|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
p300_394.txt|The award was a lifeline for me.
p300_395.txt|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p300_396.txt|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
p300_397.txt|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p300_398.txt|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p300_399.txt|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p300_400.txt|Six other people were injured.
p301_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p301_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p301_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p301_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p301_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p301_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p301_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p301_025.txt|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301_026.txt|They changed the world of music.
p301_027.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p301_028.txt|The law has got to be upheld.
p301_029.txt|But we're not the same person.
p301_030.txt|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301_031.txt|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p301_032.txt|The punishment was swift.
p301_033.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301_034.txt|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301_035.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_036.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301_037.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p301_038.txt|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p301_039.txt|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_040.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301_041.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p301_042.txt|I have played really well all year.
p301_043.txt|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301_044.txt|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301_045.txt|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p301_046.txt|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p301_047.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p301_048.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p301_049.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_050.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_051.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p301_052.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p301_053.txt|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_054.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p301_055.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301_056.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p301_057.txt|I keep my fingers crossed.
p301_058.txt|The encounter was to change his life.
p301_059.txt|It's the best of both worlds.
p301_060.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_061.txt|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_062.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p301_063.txt|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_064.txt|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_065.txt|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p301_066.txt|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p301_067.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p301_068.txt|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p301_069.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301_070.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p301_071.txt|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_072.txt|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_073.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_074.txt|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_075.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_076.txt|This is a mental challenge.
p301_077.txt|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_078.txt|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p301_079.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_080.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_081.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p301_082.txt|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p301_083.txt|Cars are great for going long distances.
p301_084.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p301_085.txt|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_086.txt|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301_087.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p301_088.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p301_089.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301_090.txt|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301_091.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p301_092.txt|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301_093.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301_094.txt|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_095.txt|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301_096.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p301_097.txt|He was married with a young child.
p301_098.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p301_099.txt|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_100.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p301_101.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301_102.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p301_103.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p301_104.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301_105.txt|Is your life a little too easy?
p301_106.txt|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301_107.txt|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_108.txt|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_109.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301_110.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p301_111.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p301_112.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301_113.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301_114.txt|He took away my childhood.
p301_115.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p301_116.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p301_117.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301_118.txt|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301_119.txt|It is not great art.
p301_120.txt|You do not change overnight.
p301_121.txt|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301_122.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p301_123.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p301_124.txt|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_125.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p301_126.txt|Tony Blair should get out more.
p301_127.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p301_128.txt|He was just awesome.
p301_129.txt|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p301_130.txt|We need to move forward together.
p301_131.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p301_132.txt|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p301_133.txt|Both were later released after a check-up.
p301_134.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p301_135.txt|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p301_136.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p301_137.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301_138.txt|The son has autism and other problems.
p301_139.txt|I'm very puzzled by it.
p301_140.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301_141.txt|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p301_142.txt|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301_143.txt|All things are possible if you believe.
p301_144.txt|This was not just incongruous.
p301_145.txt|It is patently true.
p301_146.txt|You hope he prevails.
p301_147.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p301_148.txt|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301_149.txt|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p301_150.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p301_151.txt|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p301_152.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p301_153.txt|He was forced to quit.
p301_154.txt|It is good for their eyesight.
p301_155.txt|I was loving that little girl.
p301_156.txt|But you can't have it both ways.
p301_157.txt|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301_158.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p301_159.txt|The death toll included five children.
p301_160.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p301_161.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p301_162.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p301_163.txt|This is a United Kingdom.
p301_164.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p301_165.txt|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301_166.txt|However, who could have predicted this result?
p301_167.txt|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_168.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p301_169.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p301_170.txt|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301_171.txt|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301_172.txt|The answer is mayhem.
p301_173.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p301_174.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p301_175.txt|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301_176.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p301_177.txt|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301_178.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p301_179.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p301_180.txt|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301_181.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p301_182.txt|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p301_183.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p301_184.txt|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_185.txt|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301_186.txt|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p301_187.txt|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301_188.txt|I hope you miss the cut.
p301_189.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p301_190.txt|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p301_191.txt|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_192.txt|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301_193.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p301_194.txt|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301_195.txt|Harold is a rarity.
p301_196.txt|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301_197.txt|I want him to take on Gomez.
p301_198.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p301_199.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p301_200.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301_201.txt|Well, what do you know?
p301_202.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_203.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301_204.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301_205.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p301_206.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p301_207.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p301_208.txt|We have no choice but to shut down.
p301_209.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p301_210.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p301_211.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p301_212.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p301_213.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p301_214.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p301_215.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p301_216.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_217.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p301_218.txt|These findings would be made public.
p301_219.txt|What are you not good at?
p301_220.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p301_221.txt|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p301_222.txt|This makes no sense!
p301_223.txt|I go home only once.
p301_224.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p301_225.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p301_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p301_227.txt|The team this year is going places.
p301_228.txt|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p301_229.txt|It took more than two years.
p301_230.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p301_231.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p301_232.txt|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301_233.txt|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301_234.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p301_235.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p301_236.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p301_237.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301_238.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p301_239.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p301_240.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301_241.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p301_242.txt|There are nine people here now.
p301_243.txt|His son is a local legend.
p301_244.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p301_245.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p301_246.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301_247.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p301_248.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p301_249.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301_250.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301_251.txt|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p301_252.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p301_253.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p301_254.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p301_255.txt|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p301_256.txt|Wagner was never like this.
p301_257.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301_258.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301_259.txt|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p301_260.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p301_261.txt|We're not travel agents.
p301_262.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301_263.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p301_264.txt|It's the same old story.
p301_265.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p301_266.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p301_267.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p301_268.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p301_269.txt|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_270.txt|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301_271.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p301_272.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301_273.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p301_274.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p301_275.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p301_276.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p301_277.txt|Little Voice is on general release.
p301_278.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301_279.txt|There is no substitute.
p301_280.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p301_281.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p301_282.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p301_283.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301_284.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p301_285.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p301_286.txt|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p301_287.txt|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301_288.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p301_289.txt|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301_290.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p301_291.txt|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301_292.txt|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p301_293.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p301_294.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p301_295.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_296.txt|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301_297.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p301_298.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p301_299.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p301_300.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p301_301.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p301_302.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p301_303.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p301_304.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p301_305.txt|That it is a brand name.
p301_306.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301_307.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p301_308.txt|They will have to make changes.
p301_309.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p301_310.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p301_311.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p301_312.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p301_313.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301_314.txt|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301_315.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p301_316.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p301_317.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p301_318.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301_319.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p301_320.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301_321.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301_322.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p301_323.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p301_324.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p301_325.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p301_326.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p301_327.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p301_328.txt|He is young but not too young.
p301_329.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p301_330.txt|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p301_331.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p301_332.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301_333.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p301_334.txt|There is no answer to it.
p301_335.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p301_336.txt|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301_337.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p301_338.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p301_339.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p301_340.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p301_341.txt|I am not putting myself down.
p301_342.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p301_343.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p301_344.txt|We were lucky to have survived.
p301_345.txt|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301_346.txt|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p301_347.txt|I just want to change my life.
p301_348.txt|He did not oppose the divorce.
p301_349.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p301_350.txt|And Michael was just great.
p301_351.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p301_352.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301_353.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p301_354.txt|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301_355.txt|That only came out during a radio interview.
p301_356.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p301_357.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p301_358.txt|We must not go down that road.
p301_359.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p301_360.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p301_361.txt|And that match was played in June.
p301_362.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p301_363.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301_364.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p301_365.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301_366.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p301_367.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p301_368.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p301_369.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p301_370.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p301_371.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p301_372.txt|His job was not advertised.
p301_373.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301_374.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p301_375.txt|He has changed my life for ever.
p301_376.txt|The home was now under new management.
p301_377.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_378.txt|There is no openness.
p301_379.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p301_380.txt|It was a job he loved.
p301_381.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p301_382.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301_383.txt|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p301_384.txt|It looks like paradise.
p301_385.txt|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301_386.txt|We were short of athletes.
p301_387.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301_388.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p301_389.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p301_390.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p301_391.txt|I had no qualms about it.
p301_392.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p301_393.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p301_394.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p301_395.txt|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p301_396.txt|It was early morning.
p301_397.txt|Partition is not an option.
p301_398.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p301_399.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301_400.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301_401.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p301_402.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p301_403.txt|There was no cohesion.
p301_404.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p301_405.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p301_406.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p301_407.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p301_408.txt|I saw some good things.
p301_409.txt|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p301_410.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p301_411.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p302_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p302_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302_005.txt|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p302_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p302_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p302_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p302_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p302_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p302_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p302_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p302_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p302_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p302_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p302_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p302_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p302_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p302_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p302_025.txt|It does make a big difference.
p302_026.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p302_027.txt|Each one has its own system.
p302_028.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p302_029.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p302_030.txt|It is a very special city.
p302_031.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p302_032.txt|He's not very big, either.
p302_033.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p302_034.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p302_035.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p302_036.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302_037.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p302_038.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302_039.txt|All of us do.
p302_040.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p302_041.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p302_042.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p302_043.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p302_044.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302_045.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p302_046.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p302_047.txt|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302_048.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p302_049.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p302_050.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p302_051.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p302_052.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p302_053.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p302_054.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302_055.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p302_056.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p302_057.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302_058.txt|We must improve our relations with the government.
p302_059.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p302_060.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p302_061.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p302_062.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p302_063.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302_064.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p302_065.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p302_066.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p302_067.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p302_068.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p302_069.txt|I hope we can put it behind us.
p302_070.txt|But it was to no avail.
p302_071.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302_072.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p302_073.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p302_074.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p302_075.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302_076.txt|You do have a way out.
p302_077.txt|It is simple, really.
p302_078.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p302_079.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p302_080.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p302_081.txt|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p302_082.txt|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p302_083.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302_084.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p302_085.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p302_086.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p302_087.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302_088.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p302_089.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p302_090.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p302_091.txt|He was a crazy man.
p302_092.txt|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p302_093.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302_094.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p302_095.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p302_096.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p302_097.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p302_098.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302_099.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p302_100.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p302_101.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302_102.txt|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302_103.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p302_104.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p302_105.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p302_106.txt|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p302_107.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p302_108.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p302_109.txt|Or so it would appear.
p302_110.txt|I hope they understand that.
p302_111.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p302_112.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p302_114.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302_115.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p302_116.txt|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p302_117.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p302_118.txt|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302_119.txt|It ignores the future.
p302_120.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p302_121.txt|The trial is set for February.
p302_122.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p302_123.txt|Do not go into government buildings.
p302_124.txt|There is only one caveat.
p302_125.txt|We are still getting signals.
p302_126.txt|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302_127.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p302_128.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302_129.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p302_130.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p302_131.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p302_132.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p302_133.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p302_134.txt|It has been in place since last July.
p302_135.txt|The European Court is our only option.
p302_136.txt|Do you think they would be any better?
p302_137.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p302_138.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302_139.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302_140.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p302_141.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p302_142.txt|It will be the final push.
p302_143.txt|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p302_144.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p302_145.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p302_146.txt|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302_147.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p302_148.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302_149.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302_150.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p302_151.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302_152.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p302_153.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p302_154.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p302_155.txt|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p302_156.txt|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p302_157.txt|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p302_158.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302_159.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p302_160.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p302_161.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p302_162.txt|The red card was okay.
p302_163.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p302_164.txt|But they will not be compelled to join.
p302_165.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302_166.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302_167.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p302_168.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p302_169.txt|We must put a marker down.
p302_170.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302_171.txt|There is no date on this document.
p302_172.txt|And now he tells us.
p302_173.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p302_174.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302_175.txt|It is time to come into the limelight.
p302_176.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p302_177.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p302_179.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p302_180.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p302_181.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p302_182.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p302_183.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p302_184.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p302_185.txt|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p302_186.txt|They have two children.
p302_187.txt|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p302_188.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p302_189.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p302_190.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p302_191.txt|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p302_192.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p302_193.txt|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p302_194.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p302_195.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p302_196.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p302_197.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p302_198.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302_199.txt|All the names are familiar to me.
p302_200.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p302_201.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302_202.txt|I've never been limited on drugs.
p302_203.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p302_204.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302_205.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p302_206.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p302_207.txt|Why should we even be asked to share?
p302_208.txt|Which means it matters.
p302_209.txt|There is a great potential on this river.
p302_210.txt|I was surprised by his response.
p302_211.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302_212.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302_213.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p302_214.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p302_215.txt|Is this accurate?
p302_216.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p302_217.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302_218.txt|They could go no further forward.
p302_219.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p302_220.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p302_221.txt|They make it look very easy.
p302_222.txt|It was a total surprise.
p302_223.txt|I had enough on.
p302_224.txt|And we're not there yet.
p302_225.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p302_226.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302_227.txt|plays in dark blue.
p302_228.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p302_229.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p302_230.txt|Survival is our aim.
p302_231.txt|There is no reason at all.
p302_232.txt|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302_233.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p302_234.txt|I'm pleased with the horse.
p302_235.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302_236.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p302_237.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302_238.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302_239.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p302_240.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p302_241.txt|There was no safety net.
p302_242.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p302_243.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p302_244.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302_245.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p302_246.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p302_247.txt|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p302_248.txt|He should be a great asset.
p302_249.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p302_250.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p302_251.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p302_252.txt|We could have got three medals.
p302_253.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302_254.txt|We are at a crossroads.
p302_255.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p302_257.txt|It didn't take long.
p302_258.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p302_259.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302_260.txt|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p302_261.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p302_262.txt|It's not one for the purists.
p302_263.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p302_264.txt|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p302_265.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302_266.txt|It is a time bomb.
p302_267.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302_268.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p302_269.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p302_270.txt|The outstanding issues are still there.
p302_271.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p302_272.txt|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p302_274.txt|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p302_275.txt|That got me out of jail.
p302_276.txt|We have turned the corner.
p302_277.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p302_278.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p302_279.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p302_280.txt|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p302_281.txt|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p302_282.txt|I see no need for change.
p302_283.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p302_284.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p302_285.txt|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302_286.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p302_287.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p302_288.txt|They came into collision with Sergio.
p302_289.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p302_290.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p302_291.txt|He is a success story by any standard.
p302_292.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p302_293.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p302_294.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p302_295.txt|We work on the same level.
p302_296.txt|I've got a young family.
p302_297.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p302_298.txt|It all seemed so easy.
p302_299.txt|I really don't understand what is happening.
p302_300.txt|The frustration was showing.
p302_301.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p302_302.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p302_303.txt|My friends were very envious.
p302_304.txt|The snipers are also out.
p302_305.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p302_306.txt|We are determined to establish the facts.
p302_307.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p302_308.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p302_309.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p302_310.txt|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p302_311.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p302_312.txt|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p302_313.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p302_314.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p302_315.txt|It's like the Russians.
p302_316.txt|Is that Titanic?
p303_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p303_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p303_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p303_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p303_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p303_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p303_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p303_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p303_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p303_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p303_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p303_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p303_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p303_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p303_015.txt|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p303_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p303_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p303_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p303_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p303_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p303_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p303_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p303_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p303_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p303_025.txt|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303_026.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p303_027.txt|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303_028.txt|That is just a load of baloney.
p303_029.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p303_030.txt|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p303_031.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p303_032.txt|The feeling is marvellous.
p303_033.txt|I think they should have more respect.
p303_034.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303_035.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p303_036.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_037.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303_038.txt|It was a crucial moment.
p303_039.txt|We gave everything we had.
p303_040.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p303_041.txt|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303_042.txt|His charisma is all on the course.
p303_043.txt|This is purely financial.
p303_044.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p303_045.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p303_046.txt|I did not want any damage to us.
p303_047.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p303_048.txt|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p303_049.txt|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p303_050.txt|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303_051.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p303_052.txt|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p303_053.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p303_054.txt|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p303_055.txt|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303_056.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p303_057.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p303_058.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p303_059.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p303_060.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p303_061.txt|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p303_062.txt|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303_063.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p303_064.txt|Seven children had lost both parents.
p303_065.txt|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303_066.txt|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p303_067.txt|Most people know that.
p303_068.txt|Some people still think she should be English.
p303_069.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_070.txt|Repayment is not part of the game.
p303_071.txt|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303_072.txt|What do they pay to join the club?
p303_073.txt|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p303_074.txt|We are now in a safe place.
p303_075.txt|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p303_076.txt|It will be very useful for us.
p303_077.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p303_078.txt|We just try to make great records.
p303_079.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p303_080.txt|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p303_081.txt|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p303_082.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p303_083.txt|His parenthood is called into question.
p303_084.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p303_085.txt|We really need research to help with that.
p303_086.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p303_087.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p303_088.txt|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p303_089.txt|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p303_090.txt|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p303_091.txt|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p303_092.txt|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303_093.txt|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303_094.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p303_095.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p303_096.txt|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303_097.txt|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303_098.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p303_099.txt|Their vision was not impeded.
p303_100.txt|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p303_101.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p303_102.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p303_103.txt|He went to see what he could learn.
p303_104.txt|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p303_105.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p303_106.txt|The luxury has been well used.
p303_107.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p303_108.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p303_109.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p303_110.txt|There was no time scale.
p303_111.txt|Only the scale of change differed.
p303_112.txt|Tell you the team he picked?
p303_113.txt|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303_114.txt|The cold war is over.
p303_115.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p303_116.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p303_117.txt|And it's more subversive.
p303_118.txt|We are losing this war.
p303_119.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p303_120.txt|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p303_121.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p303_122.txt|I've got no secret.
p303_123.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303_124.txt|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p303_125.txt|I asked why he had come.
p303_126.txt|Will they ever reopen?
p303_127.txt|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p303_128.txt|A lot of people were in tears.
p303_129.txt|We have great team spirit.
p303_130.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p303_131.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p303_132.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p303_133.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p303_134.txt|We have big ideas.
p303_135.txt|I first met him last summer.
p303_136.txt|It was to be published next month.
p303_137.txt|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303_138.txt|It could have been a hammering by now.
p303_139.txt|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p303_140.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p303_141.txt|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303_142.txt|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303_143.txt|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p303_144.txt|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303_145.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p303_146.txt|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p303_147.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p303_148.txt|All kinds of things occur.
p303_149.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p303_150.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p303_151.txt|It is always the same, isn't it?
p303_152.txt|Who would take it now, after all this?
p303_153.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p303_154.txt|That gives us something to kick against.
p303_155.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303_156.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p303_157.txt|There is precious little middle ground.
p303_158.txt|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p303_159.txt|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303_160.txt|They were both delightful to work with.
p303_161.txt|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303_162.txt|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p303_163.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p303_164.txt|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303_165.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p303_166.txt|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p303_167.txt|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p303_168.txt|Can they be serious?
p303_169.txt|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p303_170.txt|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303_171.txt|It's just that we see different things.
p303_172.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p303_173.txt|We're all family men with children.
p303_174.txt|I think we showed that after half time.
p303_175.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p303_176.txt|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303_177.txt|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303_178.txt|You let a lot of people down.
p303_179.txt|One person was believed to have been hit.
p303_180.txt|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p303_181.txt|We aren't going to play better.
p303_182.txt|They just would not have run away.
p303_183.txt|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303_184.txt|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p303_185.txt|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303_186.txt|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p303_187.txt|Our people should be immune.
p303_188.txt|Glasgow then took control.
p303_189.txt|It is simple and easy to use.
p303_190.txt|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303_191.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303_192.txt|I think we finished fifth.
p303_193.txt|It was not a foul.
p303_194.txt|We know them as mobile telephones.
p303_195.txt|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p303_196.txt|I don't know exactly what happened.
p303_197.txt|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p303_198.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p303_199.txt|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303_200.txt|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p303_201.txt|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p303_202.txt|I am not a happy man.
p303_203.txt|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303_204.txt|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p303_205.txt|I'm going with all three.
p303_206.txt|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303_207.txt|The line-up is a tasty one.
p303_208.txt|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_209.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p303_210.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p303_211.txt|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p303_212.txt|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_213.txt|They should also have the right to vote.
p303_214.txt|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303_215.txt|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p303_216.txt|People are so negative about the whole business.
p303_217.txt|They had given up on him.
p303_218.txt|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_219.txt|It has made me feel good.
p303_220.txt|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p303_221.txt|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p303_222.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p303_223.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_224.txt|I was living with my mum.
p303_225.txt|It did my image a lot of good!
p303_226.txt|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303_227.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p303_228.txt|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303_229.txt|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303_230.txt|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303_231.txt|I fell in love with ballet.
p303_232.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p303_233.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p303_234.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p303_235.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p303_236.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p303_237.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p303_238.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303_239.txt|I think in three dimensions.
p303_240.txt|They had four children together.
p303_241.txt|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303_242.txt|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p303_243.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p303_244.txt|All were later allowed home.
p303_245.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p303_246.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_247.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p303_248.txt|It is the end of an era.
p303_249.txt|We can just get on with our game.
p303_250.txt|But first it goes out on TV.
p303_251.txt|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_252.txt|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303_253.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p303_254.txt|I learned a lot from her.
p303_255.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p303_256.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p303_257.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p303_258.txt|They have a very good method of working.
p303_259.txt|Do you think you have a shot?
p303_260.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p303_261.txt|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303_262.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p303_263.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p303_264.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p303_265.txt|I've seen some of the submissions.
p303_266.txt|There is no such thing.
p303_267.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p303_268.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p303_269.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p303_270.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303_271.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_272.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_273.txt|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303_274.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p303_275.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p303_276.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303_277.txt|Last year, however, was a different story.
p303_278.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p303_279.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p303_280.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p303_281.txt|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p303_282.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303_283.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303_284.txt|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p303_285.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303_286.txt|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p303_287.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p303_288.txt|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p303_289.txt|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p303_290.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303_291.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303_292.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p303_293.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p303_294.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p303_295.txt|And that was the adults.
p303_296.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_297.txt|That is a job for the Government.
p303_298.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p303_299.txt|And he had much need.
p303_300.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_301.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p303_302.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_304.txt|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p303_305.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p303_306.txt|Some have other commitments.
p303_307.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p303_308.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303_309.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p303_310.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p303_311.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p303_312.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p303_313.txt|Rapid revision was required.
p303_314.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303_315.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p303_316.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p303_317.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303_318.txt|We have grown up in Britain.
p303_319.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p303_320.txt|I am proud of those guys.
p303_321.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p303_322.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p303_323.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p303_324.txt|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_325.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p303_326.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p303_327.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p303_328.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p303_329.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p303_330.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303_331.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p303_332.txt|I have a theory.
p303_333.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p303_334.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303_335.txt|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p303_336.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p303_337.txt|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303_338.txt|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_339.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p303_340.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303_341.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303_342.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p303_343.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p303_344.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p303_345.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p303_346.txt|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303_347.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p303_348.txt|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303_349.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p303_350.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303_351.txt|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303_352.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p303_353.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p304_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p304_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p304_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p304_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p304_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p304_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p304_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p304_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p304_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p304_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p304_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p304_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p304_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p304_025.txt|So we will cut their numbers.
p304_026.txt|Who cares about that?
p304_027.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304_028.txt|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_029.txt|I know my job.
p304_030.txt|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304_031.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p304_032.txt|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304_033.txt|They agree to meet.
p304_034.txt|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p304_035.txt|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p304_036.txt|The most important thing was to win today.
p304_037.txt|We have a strong team at the moment.
p304_038.txt|At half-time you have?
p304_039.txt|The butcher is very good.
p304_040.txt|He is dying from cancer.
p304_041.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p304_042.txt|It was an ambush.
p304_043.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p304_044.txt|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_045.txt|I was doing a charity concert.
p304_046.txt|You have to have a sense of humour.
p304_047.txt|It is not about changing our image.
p304_048.txt|We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_049.txt|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_050.txt|His father said, My son was lucky.
p304_051.txt|But they also came with a downside.
p304_052.txt|She was only doing her job.
p304_053.txt|Are you listening, All Saints?
p304_054.txt|And then came the seventies.
p304_055.txt|I guess it is down to focus.
p304_056.txt|I'm very angry about it.
p304_057.txt|I have great respect for all my players.
p304_058.txt|His track record is not promising.
p304_059.txt|For a moment it was all about her.
p304_060.txt|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p304_061.txt|Trading Places was too obvious.
p304_062.txt|They don't know how to do it.
p304_063.txt|No details were disclosed.
p304_064.txt|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304_065.txt|If you can get away with it, you do it.
p304_066.txt|First is open defiance.
p304_067.txt|You probably have never seen them before.
p304_068.txt|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p304_069.txt|We have avoided that at least.
p304_070.txt|I love a clever reader.
p304_071.txt|I do not believe they are.
p304_072.txt|That is completely against Islam.
p304_073.txt|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
p304_074.txt|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304_075.txt|I will wait until later.
p304_076.txt|But, of course, it isn't.
p304_077.txt|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p304_078.txt|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_079.txt|Could it be?
p304_080.txt|It is bad news for us and England.
p304_081.txt|They had failed to explode.
p304_082.txt|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_083.txt|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p304_084.txt|Nor should there have been.
p304_085.txt|Smoking is also very important.
p304_086.txt|I have a theory.
p304_087.txt|He was determined to write a novel.
p304_088.txt|So is there anything left to say?
p304_089.txt|My back is feeling really good.
p304_090.txt|They've got their own agenda.
p304_091.txt|This commitment should be built upon.
p304_092.txt|It was one he was born to play.
p304_093.txt|But we are losing that connection.
p304_094.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p304_095.txt|I am about protecting the state pension.
p304_096.txt|We will look into it.
p304_097.txt|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p304_098.txt|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_099.txt|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304_100.txt|Did you get the script?
p304_101.txt|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304_102.txt|There, you were just a body.
p304_103.txt|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p304_104.txt|Four people died instantly.
p304_105.txt|He did not know his daughter.
p304_106.txt|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304_107.txt|Our children are the future of our society.
p304_108.txt|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_109.txt|I can't believe it's all gone.
p304_110.txt|I am just going to go for it.
p304_111.txt|We will meet again.
p304_112.txt|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304_113.txt|Part of the complex is historic.
p304_114.txt|We need to chat.
p304_115.txt|Justice was not seen today.
p304_116.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p304_117.txt|This is not about revenge.
p304_118.txt|How can we ignore it?
p304_119.txt|It's totally double standards.
p304_120.txt|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p304_121.txt|It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_122.txt|We are taking the back seat on this.
p304_123.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p304_124.txt|But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_125.txt|We told them in August.
p304_126.txt|We are going to have a parade.
p304_127.txt|That could be at least five years away.
p304_128.txt|That is my role.
p304_129.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p304_130.txt|You would be a fool not to listen.
p304_131.txt|No other offers apply.
p304_132.txt|Have you noticed?
p304_133.txt|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p304_134.txt|The Lobby is not failing.
p304_135.txt|It was a takeover.
p304_136.txt|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p304_137.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_138.txt|How many cases have there been?
p304_139.txt|But we have to plan for the future.
p304_140.txt|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_141.txt|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p304_142.txt|That's a pretty good percentage.
p304_143.txt|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_144.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304_145.txt|You have to think not.
p304_146.txt|This is a total mystery.
p304_147.txt|They were due to have begun today.
p304_148.txt|Do not listen to them.
p304_149.txt|So what makes it so special?
p304_150.txt|It will be easier for us.
p304_151.txt|I'm pleased for him.
p304_152.txt|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p304_153.txt|You need a trademark.
p304_154.txt|This is our Olympics.
p304_155.txt|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_156.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p304_157.txt|My goal was very important to the team.
p304_158.txt|There are plenty examples.
p304_159.txt|This is not a Scottish problem.
p304_160.txt|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p304_161.txt|I have worked with him on projects.
p304_162.txt|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_163.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304_164.txt|And there is no cause for it.
p304_165.txt|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304_166.txt|What has changed?
p304_167.txt|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_168.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p304_169.txt|He asked me how they were doing.
p304_170.txt|They would have looked out for each other.
p304_171.txt|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_172.txt|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
p304_174.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p304_175.txt|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_176.txt|The result today is an impasse.
p304_177.txt|Nelson does not disappoint.
p304_178.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p304_179.txt|The real world is full of competing causes.
p304_180.txt|They've got to decide to do that.
p304_181.txt|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p304_182.txt|These are terrible offences.
p304_183.txt|This is it finally finished.
p304_184.txt|An announcement is expected today on their future.
p304_185.txt|There were so many characters among them.
p304_186.txt|Or is it the European approach?
p304_187.txt|We could not get any possession.
p304_188.txt|Did you see that?
p304_189.txt|The cost of war is more than that.
p304_190.txt|I saw the whole thing.
p304_191.txt|There is a demand for another hospice.
p304_192.txt|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p304_193.txt|Then they were awarded a penalty.
p304_194.txt|Journalists should make him.
p304_195.txt|They will have five minutes to decide.
p304_196.txt|I see that any day now.
p304_197.txt|But who knows?
p304_198.txt|He was tough and relentless.
p304_199.txt|That would be unlawful.
p304_200.txt|This guy is amazing.
p304_201.txt|The same goes for McKenna.
p304_202.txt|That is no use.
p304_203.txt|They will want to perform well.
p304_204.txt|We should not worry about other players.
p304_205.txt|Ownership was the game.
p304_206.txt|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p304_207.txt|I love the moment of being first.
p304_208.txt|Some examples are presented in detail.
p304_209.txt|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_210.txt|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p304_211.txt|I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_212.txt|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_213.txt|It was total confusion.
p304_214.txt|I have learned from him.
p304_215.txt|Pupils will be the losers.
p304_216.txt|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_217.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p304_218.txt|That is why it is so lyrical.
p304_219.txt|It isn't a happy memory.
p304_220.txt|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304_221.txt|Who would be a referee?
p304_222.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p304_223.txt|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_224.txt|He was correct in everything he did.
p304_225.txt|I see no reason for them to be.
p304_226.txt|I never agreed with that.
p304_227.txt|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304_228.txt|I don't think it is vital.
p304_229.txt|But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_230.txt|That could run into millions.
p304_231.txt|It might not survive the process.
p304_232.txt|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
p304_233.txt|I'm really excited about the album.
p304_234.txt|We were desperate to get the game on.
p304_235.txt|But there is a possible place.
p304_236.txt|You can't have it both ways.
p304_237.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p304_238.txt|But they will need to play to score.
p304_239.txt|He is a joy to watch.
p304_240.txt|They also have good neighbours.
p304_241.txt|We are now open.
p304_242.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304_243.txt|There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_244.txt|Now it has become a big picture.
p304_245.txt|We want to learn lessons from that.
p304_246.txt|He can perform well under pressure.
p304_247.txt|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_248.txt|He was totally without that form of fear.
p304_249.txt|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p304_250.txt|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304_251.txt|They have the cash to do that.
p304_252.txt|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304_253.txt|He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_254.txt|And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304_255.txt|It is a great shame.
p304_256.txt|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_257.txt|The council has been open and transparent.
p304_258.txt|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p304_259.txt|I felt he was excellent.
p304_260.txt|It was a policy they were against.
p304_261.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p304_262.txt|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304_263.txt|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304_264.txt|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_265.txt|He has changed the country itself.
p304_266.txt|The look on his face was something special.
p304_267.txt|I can certainly see much better.
p304_268.txt|We then went to see the headmaster.
p304_269.txt|I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_270.txt|It would then be up to the judge.
p304_271.txt|Are we going to stay up?
p304_272.txt|People were actually not on his side.
p304_273.txt|It was a very difficult period.
p304_274.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p304_275.txt|It used to be less than five minutes.
p304_276.txt|It was by the numbers.
p304_277.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p304_278.txt|It is my fault.
p304_279.txt|We are not asking for the moon.
p304_280.txt|That used to be another thing of mine.
p304_281.txt|At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_282.txt|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304_283.txt|Teachers have been given the offer.
p304_284.txt|He called for a public inquiry.
p304_285.txt|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304_286.txt|I played badly, but it happens.
p304_287.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p304_288.txt|I lost my head.
p304_289.txt|What are the barriers?
p304_290.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p304_291.txt|You are not going in blind.
p304_292.txt|You had to go and see him.
p304_293.txt|She says she has grown up.
p304_294.txt|He met his wife and married in England.
p304_295.txt|But it could have been written for her.
p304_296.txt|It makes no sense.
p304_297.txt|What will they called?
p304_298.txt|We come here in peace, for peace.
p304_299.txt|He will feel the pain again.
p304_300.txt|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p304_301.txt|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_302.txt|Is Saddam a threat?
p304_303.txt|The jury is still out.
p304_304.txt|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p304_305.txt|I can't say that this is very usual.
p304_306.txt|He is married, with two children.
p304_307.txt|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
p304_308.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p304_309.txt|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p304_310.txt|We understand the changes in the world.
p304_311.txt|It is a potential factor.
p304_312.txt|The working families tax credit is far better.
p304_313.txt|It added to the reverence.
p304_314.txt|It is too early to say.
p304_315.txt|It's to do with context.
p304_316.txt|David Trimble has sold out.
p304_317.txt|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_318.txt|I don't understand it.
p304_319.txt|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_320.txt|He was rejected because he had retired.
p304_321.txt|And then we got off the plane.
p304_322.txt|I think it is wide open.
p304_323.txt|I am totally surprised.
p304_324.txt|We are all ecstatic.
p304_325.txt|I hope he has learned from it.
p304_326.txt|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p304_327.txt|You are a gambling man.
p304_328.txt|Who honestly expected anything else?
p304_329.txt|The search has been called off.
p304_330.txt|The matter will come up again.
p304_331.txt|Our strategy is straightforward.
p304_332.txt|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304_333.txt|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304_334.txt|They were unable to revive him.
p304_335.txt|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_336.txt|Yes, it was too short a night.
p304_337.txt|It is not for me, though.
p304_338.txt|It really was my favourite.
p304_339.txt|That is why this action has been taken.
p304_340.txt|They should be looking at his victims.
p304_341.txt|There were many positives for this club.
p304_342.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p304_343.txt|There wasn't anything in it.
p304_344.txt|What do we do for an encore?
p304_345.txt|Things start to talk to each other.
p304_346.txt|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p304_347.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p304_348.txt|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304_349.txt|That is a lot of writing.
p304_350.txt|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304_351.txt|It is no place for a poet.
p304_352.txt|There is room for me.
p304_353.txt|My life is in the ballet.
p304_354.txt|For next season, we have time to restructure.
p304_355.txt|The truth, of course, is very different.
p304_356.txt|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p304_357.txt|These will take a little time to develop.
p304_358.txt|This is not a birthday party.
p304_359.txt|Darren is very, very good.
p304_360.txt|It's a drop in the bucket.
p304_361.txt|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p304_362.txt|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_363.txt|She is still very poorly.
p304_364.txt|That's how she wants to remember him.
p304_365.txt|There was no disruption to services.
p304_366.txt|We talk about effective military action.
p304_367.txt|It was a discussion paper.
p304_368.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p304_369.txt|He had no problem with alcohol.
p304_370.txt|This was a very tragic accident.
p304_371.txt|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p304_372.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p304_373.txt|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304_374.txt|I wish him well.
p304_375.txt|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_376.txt|They say they feel different.
p304_377.txt|We are in the hat.
p304_378.txt|Well, what can you do?
p304_379.txt|Motorists will welcome this.
p304_380.txt|It is not the message alone.
p304_381.txt|She failed to win any of them.
p304_382.txt|He is at war with his knee.
p304_383.txt|I think we're going to make it.
p304_384.txt|I didn't know where they were.
p304_385.txt|Clubs can only do so much.
p304_386.txt|Many other areas are coming up.
p304_387.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p304_388.txt|But let's not go down that road.
p304_389.txt|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_390.txt|Changes need to be made.
p304_391.txt|I don't care to recall it.
p304_392.txt|That's the way things are heading.
p304_393.txt|Hard it will be.
p304_394.txt|He just attracted people.
p304_395.txt|It was better than a soap opera.
p304_396.txt|I doubt it would be genuine.
p304_397.txt|You must be ready to play anyone.
p304_398.txt|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p304_399.txt|It seems a waste of talents.
p304_400.txt|It is the worst of both worlds.
p304_401.txt|We need to tighten up.
p304_402.txt|His body was never found.
p304_403.txt|Just get on with your job.
p304_404.txt|We expect a full house on the night.
p304_405.txt|He said it was his greatest work.
p304_406.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p304_407.txt|They are different types.
p304_408.txt|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p304_409.txt|We are not too surprised.
p304_410.txt|They are not a set of options.
p304_411.txt|But it was money well spent.
p304_412.txt|They would never let him go.
p304_413.txt|Which is worse?
p304_414.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p304_415.txt|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_416.txt|He took over our lives.
p304_417.txt|I would think they are just behind them.
p304_418.txt|We would all have liked to run.
p304_419.txt|I can understand why they have gone.
p304_420.txt|That, though, was then.
p304_421.txt|People should not become complacent.
p304_422.txt|I will go out with him any time.
p304_423.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304_424.txt|Public safety is paramount.
p305_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p305_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p305_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p305_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p305_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p305_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p305_025.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305_026.txt|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p305_027.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_028.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_029.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305_030.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_031.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_032.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p305_033.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p305_034.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p305_035.txt|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_036.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p305_037.txt|Who has he fought?
p305_038.txt|I want a free vote.
p305_039.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305_040.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_041.txt|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_042.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_043.txt|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_044.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305_045.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p305_046.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047.txt|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_048.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p305_049.txt|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050.txt|But don't expect an easy ride.
p305_051.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_052.txt|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053.txt|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054.txt|We see little sign of improvement.
p305_055.txt|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305_056.txt|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_057.txt|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p305_059.txt|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305_060.txt|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061.txt|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062.txt|That tells you something about them.
p305_063.txt|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305_064.txt|This rule is archaic.
p305_065.txt|I am a drug addict.
p305_066.txt|I've had to take time off work today.
p305_067.txt|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068.txt|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069.txt|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_070.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p305_071.txt|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_072.txt|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_073.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p305_074.txt|I've come here for the jersey.
p305_075.txt|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_076.txt|I'm so proud of my team.
p305_077.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p305_078.txt|This has not, and has been neglected.
p305_079.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080.txt|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305_081.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_082.txt|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_083.txt|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305_084.txt|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p305_085.txt|The jury is still out.
p305_086.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_087.txt|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p305_088.txt|I drove the ball well.
p305_089.txt|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_090.txt|His handling raises a wider issue.
p305_091.txt|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_092.txt|He had done his homework properly.
p305_093.txt|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_094.txt|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p305_095.txt|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p305_096.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_097.txt|My grandparents were terrified.
p305_098.txt|Are they control freaks?
p305_099.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_100.txt|They never looked like winning it either.
p305_101.txt|The party lasted all night.
p305_102.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p305_103.txt|It is understood they saw one body.
p305_104.txt|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_105.txt|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305_106.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p305_107.txt|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p305_108.txt|She is a double victim.
p305_109.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p305_110.txt|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_111.txt|It's the way we go about it.
p305_112.txt|There was an e-mail.
p305_113.txt|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_114.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p305_115.txt|Each day is a new beginning.
p305_116.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p305_117.txt|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305_118.txt|We've come from a long way back.
p305_119.txt|A lot of things can go wrong.
p305_120.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p305_121.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p305_122.txt|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123.txt|There has been no delay on government orders.
p305_124.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305_125.txt|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p305_126.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p305_127.txt|How do you respond to losing your child?
p305_128.txt|Who is the employer?
p305_129.txt|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p305_130.txt|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131.txt|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305_132.txt|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_133.txt|You can never have enough money.
p305_134.txt|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_135.txt|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305_136.txt|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_137.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_138.txt|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_139.txt|They do the work, you know.
p305_140.txt|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_141.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p305_142.txt|Other people also tried.
p305_143.txt|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_144.txt|It would have very little impact on them.
p305_145.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p305_146.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p305_147.txt|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_148.txt|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149.txt|They chose to side with terror.
p305_150.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305_151.txt|They just made me feel dizzy.
p305_152.txt|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p305_153.txt|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305_154.txt|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_155.txt|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_156.txt|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157.txt|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_158.txt|We are asking the council to think again.
p305_159.txt|He had worked there for only two days.
p305_160.txt|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p305_161.txt|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_162.txt|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_163.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305_164.txt|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_165.txt|We have already begun to do that here.
p305_166.txt|The home team also had their moments.
p305_167.txt|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_168.txt|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305_169.txt|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_170.txt|I got off to a great start.
p305_171.txt|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_172.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p305_173.txt|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p305_174.txt|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p305_175.txt|I got on very well with Allan.
p305_176.txt|That has given me great confidence.
p305_177.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p305_178.txt|He was lying face down in the water.
p305_179.txt|He urged people to forgive.
p305_180.txt|So he is open to ideas.
p305_181.txt|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_182.txt|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p305_183.txt|We are expected to do better than before.
p305_184.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p305_185.txt|I am not even thinking about that.
p305_186.txt|Angola was a really hard place.
p305_187.txt|It is giving out the wrong message.
p305_188.txt|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305_189.txt|The sleeper was six hours late.
p305_190.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_191.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p305_192.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p305_193.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_194.txt|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p305_195.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p305_196.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_197.txt|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_198.txt|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_199.txt|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p305_200.txt|He would help me with the form.
p305_201.txt|The actors just have to say so.
p305_202.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p305_203.txt|I think it was briefly considered.
p305_204.txt|It's a hidden problem.
p305_205.txt|I lost a part of me.
p305_206.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p305_207.txt|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305_208.txt|I believe in the Church.
p305_209.txt|Others were even less confident.
p305_210.txt|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_211.txt|So people will come out with these things.
p305_212.txt|You may have a short memory.
p305_213.txt|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_214.txt|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_215.txt|Every game against New Zealand is.
p305_216.txt|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_217.txt|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p305_218.txt|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_219.txt|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_220.txt|It may be his last for a while, too.
p305_221.txt|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_222.txt|Then one night only three people turn up.
p305_223.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p305_224.txt|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_225.txt|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_226.txt|Appointments should be made on merit.
p305_227.txt|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_228.txt|I think we will join the single currency.
p305_229.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p305_230.txt|Everything was up for grabs.
p305_231.txt|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p305_232.txt|There will not be any charges.
p305_233.txt|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_234.txt|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_235.txt|I think we have a very strong case.
p305_236.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p305_237.txt|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305_238.txt|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_239.txt|So the process was refined.
p305_240.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p305_241.txt|I have been here for only three months.
p305_242.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p305_243.txt|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305_244.txt|We hope this scheme will change that.
p305_245.txt|How could anyone take issue with that?
p305_246.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_247.txt|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_248.txt|They had had time for little else.
p305_249.txt|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305_250.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p305_251.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p305_252.txt|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p305_253.txt|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_254.txt|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_255.txt|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305_256.txt|But there was a shift.
p305_257.txt|Israel has done very little until now.
p305_258.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_259.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p305_260.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p305_261.txt|We certainly will need to watch him.
p305_262.txt|I don't think it could be clearer.
p305_263.txt|We can only go up.
p305_264.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305_265.txt|Our offer will remain on the table.
p305_266.txt|He is a man who lives to work.
p305_267.txt|The website is now being amended.
p305_268.txt|It's an internal matter.
p305_269.txt|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p305_270.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_271.txt|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_272.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p305_273.txt|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_274.txt|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_275.txt|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_276.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p305_277.txt|They married in August last year.
p305_278.txt|Yet he chose to do something different.
p305_279.txt|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305_280.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p305_281.txt|They really did a great job.
p305_282.txt|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_283.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p305_284.txt|I love you so very much.
p305_285.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p305_286.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p305_287.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_288.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p305_289.txt|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_290.txt|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_291.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_292.txt|Most of the public are behind me.
p305_293.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p305_294.txt|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_295.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p305_296.txt|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_297.txt|This is a very positive step forward.
p305_298.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_299.txt|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305_300.txt|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_301.txt|She is a very lucky lady.
p305_302.txt|We've been there for seven years.
p305_303.txt|They made a huge impression on me.
p305_304.txt|His signature is his handwriting.
p305_305.txt|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_306.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_307.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305_308.txt|It worked, up to a point.
p305_309.txt|One season, they might do well.
p305_310.txt|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305_311.txt|We've got a great defensive club.
p305_312.txt|It's up to their parents to choose.
p305_313.txt|I feel privileged to be here.
p305_314.txt|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_315.txt|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_316.txt|It is still holding good today.
p305_317.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p305_318.txt|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p305_319.txt|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_320.txt|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_321.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p305_322.txt|I just could not cope.
p305_323.txt|We didn't know he was even out.
p305_324.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_325.txt|Here are some possible solutions.
p305_326.txt|He made so many bad decisions.
p305_327.txt|We are now up against it.
p305_328.txt|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p305_329.txt|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_330.txt|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p305_331.txt|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_332.txt|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_333.txt|One must hope not!
p305_334.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_335.txt|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p305_336.txt|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p305_337.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p305_338.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305_339.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p305_340.txt|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_341.txt|I'm just doing artwork.
p305_342.txt|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_343.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_344.txt|So there's a double whammy.
p305_345.txt|I didn't have a trio.
p305_346.txt|Their three other children had died as infants.
p305_347.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p305_348.txt|I am astonished by this decision.
p305_349.txt|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_350.txt|We have got a full house tonight.
p305_351.txt|Our children are our future.
p305_352.txt|We will see how he is.
p305_353.txt|The fans will support us.
p305_354.txt|It was a long process, but we got there.
p305_355.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305_356.txt|The whole team was rubbish.
p305_357.txt|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_358.txt|I put the drawing down.
p305_359.txt|They feel it belongs to them.
p305_360.txt|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_361.txt|They too refused to come out and talk.
p305_362.txt|It gave me something to focus on.
p305_363.txt|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p305_364.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p305_365.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_366.txt|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p305_367.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p305_368.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305_369.txt|Now there is an even bigger target.
p305_370.txt|There has been a big change in defence.
p305_371.txt|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305_372.txt|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p305_373.txt|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305_374.txt|This must have been severe.
p305_375.txt|We're all in a state of shock.
p305_376.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305_377.txt|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p305_378.txt|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p305_379.txt|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p305_380.txt|He was released in March this year.
p305_381.txt|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p305_382.txt|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p305_383.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p305_384.txt|People might not actually want the job.
p305_385.txt|The court had a number of empty seats.
p305_386.txt|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_387.txt|It broke up my marriage.
p305_388.txt|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p305_389.txt|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_390.txt|The package has been properly costed.
p305_391.txt|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305_392.txt|The love affair was over.
p305_393.txt|For some, it was more painful than others.
p305_394.txt|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305_395.txt|I can't stop people thinking.
p305_396.txt|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_397.txt|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305_398.txt|Several people were out in the street.
p305_399.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p305_400.txt|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305_401.txt|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305_402.txt|The place became a war zone.
p305_403.txt|It is not an abortion.
p305_404.txt|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p305_405.txt|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_406.txt|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305_407.txt|See it while you can.
p305_408.txt|I didn't do too badly myself.
p305_409.txt|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305_410.txt|He has never even been to Ireland.
p305_411.txt|We believe the squad will stay together.
p305_412.txt|Such people do not exist.
p305_413.txt|We suspect he was pleased.
p305_414.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305_415.txt|She always wanted her own way.
p305_416.txt|But it is all by design.
p305_417.txt|We've still got a say in this.
p305_418.txt|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305_419.txt|I'll take what comes along.
p305_420.txt|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p305_421.txt|Women reported more depression than men.
p305_422.txt|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p306_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p306_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p306_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p306_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p306_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p306_025.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p306_026.txt|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306_027.txt|This is not an amnesty.
p306_028.txt|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p306_029.txt|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p306_030.txt|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306_031.txt|I don't believe you own anything.
p306_032.txt|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306_033.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306_034.txt|Blood samples have been taken.
p306_035.txt|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p306_036.txt|He said he now intends to fly today.
p306_037.txt|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_038.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p306_039.txt|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_040.txt|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p306_041.txt|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306_042.txt|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p306_043.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p306_044.txt|We like being the underdogs.
p306_045.txt|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_046.txt|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p306_047.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p306_048.txt|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306_049.txt|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306_050.txt|Except for this, it was offside.
p306_051.txt|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p306_052.txt|It's a grey area.
p306_053.txt|Retirement, who knows?
p306_054.txt|He was shocked by what he saw.
p306_055.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p306_056.txt|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_057.txt|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p306_058.txt|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306_059.txt|He was taken ill in December last year.
p306_060.txt|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306_061.txt|It's all too short term.
p306_062.txt|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p306_063.txt|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_064.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p306_065.txt|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_066.txt|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306_067.txt|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306_068.txt|How things have changed since then.
p306_069.txt|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306_070.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p306_071.txt|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306_072.txt|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p306_073.txt|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p306_074.txt|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p306_075.txt|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306_076.txt|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_077.txt|You'd think there was a match on today.
p306_078.txt|We must move on.
p306_079.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p306_080.txt|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p306_081.txt|His options are severely limited.
p306_082.txt|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306_083.txt|They are not an item.
p306_084.txt|Why did they let him go?
p306_085.txt|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p306_086.txt|I have made good progress.
p306_087.txt|We do need a new one.
p306_088.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306_089.txt|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p306_090.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306_091.txt|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p306_092.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p306_093.txt|But the relief was short-lived.
p306_094.txt|You had better believe it.
p306_095.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p306_096.txt|They told us about it the next day.
p306_097.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p306_098.txt|There are a huge number of arts.
p306_099.txt|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p306_100.txt|My office is bare.
p306_101.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p306_102.txt|Where is the anthrax?
p306_103.txt|Housing is in very short supply.
p306_104.txt|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p306_105.txt|People just came on their own.
p306_106.txt|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306_107.txt|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_108.txt|You either have him or you don't.
p306_109.txt|There are some new buildings in there.
p306_110.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p306_111.txt|I'm not a diva.
p306_112.txt|There is great relief at this point.
p306_113.txt|Look at them after three days of rain.
p306_115.txt|There is no point in pushing it.
p306_116.txt|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306_117.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p306_118.txt|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p306_119.txt|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p306_120.txt|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_121.txt|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306_122.txt|I will speak to Michael about this.
p306_123.txt|This is not understood by people outside.
p306_124.txt|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p306_125.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p306_126.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p306_127.txt|I went straight to the toilet.
p306_128.txt|She says the royal family get on well.
p306_129.txt|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p306_130.txt|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p306_131.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p306_132.txt|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p306_133.txt|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p306_134.txt|There is still much work to be done.
p306_135.txt|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p306_136.txt|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p306_137.txt|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p306_138.txt|We were with him the whole time.
p306_139.txt|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p306_141.txt|That's because we work hard at it.
p306_142.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p306_143.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p306_144.txt|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p306_145.txt|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p306_146.txt|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p306_147.txt|We need a new kind of theatre.
p306_148.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p306_149.txt|I feel my life to be at risk.
p306_150.txt|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p306_151.txt|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p306_152.txt|We came across the first set of bodies.
p306_153.txt|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306_154.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p306_155.txt|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306_156.txt|This is a foolish idea.
p306_157.txt|You might even have seen him.
p306_158.txt|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306_159.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p306_160.txt|She collapsed and died a day later.
p306_161.txt|You should be there with six different characters.
p306_162.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p306_163.txt|I took a minibus into town.
p306_164.txt|I do my job.
p306_165.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p306_166.txt|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p306_167.txt|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306_168.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p306_169.txt|Who do these people think they are?
p306_171.txt|We want to help them through it.
p306_172.txt|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p306_173.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p306_174.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p306_175.txt|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p306_176.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p306_177.txt|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306_178.txt|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306_179.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p306_180.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p306_181.txt|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306_182.txt|She is living proof of their expertise.
p306_183.txt|This one was my best chance.
p306_184.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p306_185.txt|I am writing a novel.
p306_186.txt|A bit of match fitness is required.
p306_187.txt|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p306_188.txt|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306_189.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p306_190.txt|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p306_191.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p306_192.txt|These elements are in the book.
p306_193.txt|You look at them and you understand.
p306_194.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p306_195.txt|I would like Glasgow.
p306_196.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p306_197.txt|We have only nine months to go.
p306_198.txt|Both of them have looked good.
p306_199.txt|I like footballers who play well.
p306_201.txt|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306_202.txt|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p306_203.txt|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p306_204.txt|Donald was a man with many friends.
p306_205.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p306_206.txt|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p306_207.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p306_208.txt|We were on top and could have won.
p306_209.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p306_210.txt|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306_211.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p306_212.txt|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p306_213.txt|It is like being a qualifier again.
p306_214.txt|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p306_215.txt|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306_216.txt|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p306_217.txt|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p306_218.txt|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p306_219.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p306_220.txt|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p306_221.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p306_222.txt|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306_223.txt|She didn't tell us anything new.
p306_224.txt|There is nothing like this back home.
p306_225.txt|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p306_226.txt|I found a fault and worked at it.
p306_227.txt|It was a poor performance.
p306_228.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p306_229.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p306_230.txt|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306_231.txt|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306_232.txt|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p306_233.txt|He will become the sovereign.
p306_234.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p306_236.txt|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p306_237.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p306_238.txt|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p306_239.txt|It's just gotten too big.
p306_240.txt|Was all this really just five months ago?
p306_241.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p306_242.txt|They were two different types.
p306_243.txt|It need not be like that.
p306_244.txt|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p306_245.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p306_246.txt|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306_247.txt|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p306_248.txt|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p306_249.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p306_250.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p306_251.txt|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p306_252.txt|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p306_253.txt|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p306_254.txt|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306_255.txt|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p306_256.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p306_257.txt|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p306_258.txt|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p306_259.txt|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306_260.txt|He must have something up his sleeve.
p306_261.txt|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p306_262.txt|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p306_263.txt|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p306_264.txt|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p306_265.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p306_266.txt|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p306_267.txt|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p306_268.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p306_269.txt|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p306_270.txt|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p306_272.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p306_273.txt|The board has rejected her proposals.
p306_274.txt|It does not move, which is amazing.
p306_275.txt|She is a very lucky young lady.
p306_276.txt|The threat to rural areas is real.
p306_277.txt|Tourism continues to struggle.
p306_278.txt|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306_279.txt|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306_281.txt|This is a great shame.
p306_282.txt|That was merely their initial problem.
p306_283.txt|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p306_284.txt|We said, What do you mean?
p306_285.txt|I need them to set my career.
p306_286.txt|The law will take its course.
p306_287.txt|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p306_288.txt|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p306_289.txt|The fund has three elements.
p306_290.txt|This is a young team, you know.
p306_291.txt|It's not even finished.
p306_292.txt|Everyone knew where they were.
p306_293.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306_294.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p306_295.txt|People will make up their own minds.
p306_296.txt|After that he became more romantic.
p306_297.txt|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306_298.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p306_299.txt|They finished second and third.
p306_300.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p306_301.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p306_302.txt|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p306_303.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306_304.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306_305.txt|People can get them if they want.
p306_306.txt|Their message was simple.
p306_307.txt|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306_308.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p306_309.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p306_310.txt|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306_311.txt|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306_312.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p306_313.txt|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p306_314.txt|It was just completely erased.
p306_315.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p306_316.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p306_317.txt|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p306_318.txt|Too often it is not.
p306_319.txt|I tend to not look back.
p306_320.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306_321.txt|I got a yellow card.
p306_322.txt|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p306_323.txt|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p306_324.txt|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306_325.txt|It's good to start with Judith.
p306_326.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p306_327.txt|It may also be her last.
p306_328.txt|Maybe it helps us.
p306_329.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p306_330.txt|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_331.txt|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306_332.txt|He made no big mistakes.
p306_333.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p306_334.txt|We will be homeless.
p306_335.txt|I believe he can do a better job.
p306_336.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p306_337.txt|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306_338.txt|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p306_339.txt|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306_340.txt|Well, was it?
p306_341.txt|We won't let you down.
p306_342.txt|What kind of person is he?
p306_343.txt|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p306_344.txt|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p306_345.txt|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p306_346.txt|English is the language of pop music.
p306_347.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306_348.txt|It is a simple equation.
p306_349.txt|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p306_351.txt|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_352.txt|Who has the second highest?
p306_354.txt|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p306_355.txt|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306_356.txt|No person was charged.
p306_357.txt|I've only met him three times.
p306_358.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p306_359.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p306_360.txt|She looked very, very poor.
p307_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p307_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p307_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p307_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p307_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p307_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p307_025.txt|But it was a great decision he joked.
p307_026.txt|They changed the world of music.
p307_027.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p307_028.txt|The law has got to be upheld.
p307_029.txt|But we're not the same person.
p307_030.txt|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p307_031.txt|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_032.txt|The punishment was swift.
p307_033.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307_034.txt|I kept my side of the bargain.
p307_035.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p307_036.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p307_037.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p307_038.txt|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307_039.txt|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307_040.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307_041.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p307_042.txt|I have played really well all year.
p307_043.txt|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307_044.txt|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_045.txt|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p307_046.txt|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p307_047.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p307_048.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p307_049.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_050.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_051.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307_052.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p307_053.txt|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_054.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307_055.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p307_056.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p307_057.txt|I keep my fingers crossed.
p307_058.txt|The encounter was to change his life.
p307_059.txt|It's the best of both worlds.
p307_060.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_061.txt|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_062.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p307_063.txt|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_064.txt|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_065.txt|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307_066.txt|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p307_067.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p307_068.txt|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p307_069.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p307_070.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p307_071.txt|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_072.txt|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_073.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_074.txt|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_075.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_076.txt|This is a mental challenge.
p307_077.txt|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_078.txt|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p307_079.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_080.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_081.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p307_082.txt|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_083.txt|Cars are great for going long distances.
p307_084.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_085.txt|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307_086.txt|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p307_087.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p307_088.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p307_089.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307_090.txt|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307_091.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p307_092.txt|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p307_093.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307_094.txt|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p307_095.txt|I have no plans to change the oath.
p307_096.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p307_097.txt|He was married with a young child.
p307_098.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p307_099.txt|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307_100.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p307_101.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307_102.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p307_103.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p307_104.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p307_105.txt|Is your life a little too easy?
p307_106.txt|I think my game is suited to grass.
p307_107.txt|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307_108.txt|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307_109.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307_110.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p307_111.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p307_112.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p307_113.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p307_114.txt|He took away my childhood.
p307_115.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307_116.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p307_117.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307_118.txt|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307_119.txt|It is not great art.
p307_120.txt|You do not change overnight.
p307_121.txt|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p307_122.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p307_123.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p307_124.txt|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307_125.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p307_126.txt|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307_127.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p307_128.txt|He was just awesome.
p307_129.txt|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_130.txt|We need to move forward together.
p307_131.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p307_132.txt|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307_133.txt|Both were later released after a check-up.
p307_134.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p307_135.txt|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p307_136.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p307_137.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307_138.txt|The son has autism and other problems.
p307_139.txt|I'm very puzzled by it.
p307_140.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307_141.txt|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307_142.txt|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_143.txt|All things are possible if you believe.
p307_144.txt|This was not just incongruous.
p307_145.txt|It is patently true.
p307_146.txt|You hope he prevails.
p307_147.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_148.txt|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p307_149.txt|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p307_150.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p307_151.txt|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p307_152.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307_153.txt|He was forced to quit.
p307_154.txt|It is good for their eyesight.
p307_155.txt|I was loving that little girl.
p307_156.txt|But you can't have it both ways.
p307_157.txt|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p307_158.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p307_159.txt|The death toll included five children.
p307_160.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p307_161.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p307_162.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p307_163.txt|This is a United Kingdom.
p307_164.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p307_165.txt|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_166.txt|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307_167.txt|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307_168.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p307_169.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p307_170.txt|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_171.txt|The problem arises because he does so much.
p307_172.txt|The answer is mayhem.
p307_173.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p307_174.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p307_175.txt|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_176.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p307_177.txt|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307_178.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p307_179.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p307_180.txt|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p307_181.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p307_182.txt|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p307_183.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p307_184.txt|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p307_185.txt|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p307_186.txt|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307_187.txt|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p307_188.txt|I hope you miss the cut.
p307_189.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p307_190.txt|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p307_191.txt|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p307_192.txt|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307_193.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p307_194.txt|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p307_195.txt|Harold is a rarity.
p307_196.txt|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307_197.txt|I want him to take on Gomez.
p307_198.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307_199.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p307_200.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p307_201.txt|Well, what do you know?
p307_202.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p307_203.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p307_204.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p307_205.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p307_206.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p307_207.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p307_208.txt|We have no choice but to shut down.
p307_209.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p307_210.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p307_211.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p307_212.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p307_213.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p307_214.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p307_215.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p307_216.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p307_217.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p307_218.txt|These findings would be made public.
p307_219.txt|What are you not good at?
p307_220.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p307_221.txt|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307_222.txt|This makes no sense!
p307_223.txt|I go home only once.
p307_224.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p307_225.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p307_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p307_227.txt|The team this year is going places.
p307_228.txt|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307_229.txt|It took more than two years.
p307_230.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p307_231.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p307_232.txt|That's the key issue isn't it?
p307_233.txt|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307_234.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p307_235.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p307_236.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p307_237.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p307_238.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p307_239.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p307_240.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p307_241.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p307_242.txt|There are nine people here now.
p307_243.txt|His son is a local legend.
p307_244.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p307_245.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p307_246.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p307_247.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p307_248.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p307_249.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p307_250.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p307_251.txt|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p307_252.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p307_253.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p307_254.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p307_255.txt|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p307_256.txt|Wanger was never like this.
p307_257.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p307_258.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p307_259.txt|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p307_260.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p307_261.txt|We're not travel agents.
p307_262.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p307_263.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p307_264.txt|It's the same old story.
p307_265.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p307_266.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p307_267.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p307_268.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p307_269.txt|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p307_270.txt|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p307_271.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p307_272.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p307_273.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p307_274.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p307_275.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p307_276.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p307_277.txt|Little Voice is on general release.
p307_278.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p307_279.txt|There is no substitute.
p307_280.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p307_281.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p307_282.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p307_283.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p307_284.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p307_285.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p307_286.txt|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p307_287.txt|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p307_288.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p307_289.txt|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p307_290.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p307_291.txt|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307_292.txt|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p307_293.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p307_294.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p307_295.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p307_296.txt|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p307_297.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p307_298.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p307_299.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p307_300.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p307_301.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p307_302.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p307_303.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p307_304.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p307_305.txt|That it is a brand name.
p307_306.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p307_307.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p307_308.txt|They will have to make changes.
p307_309.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p307_310.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p307_311.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p307_312.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p307_313.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p307_314.txt|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p307_315.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p307_316.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p307_317.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p307_318.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p307_319.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p307_320.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p307_321.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p307_322.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p307_323.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307_324.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p307_325.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307_326.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p307_327.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p307_328.txt|He is young but not too young.
p307_329.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p307_330.txt|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p307_331.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p307_332.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p307_333.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p307_334.txt|There is no answer to it.
p307_335.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p307_336.txt|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p307_337.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p307_338.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p307_339.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p307_340.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p307_341.txt|I am not putting myself down.
p307_342.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p307_343.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p307_344.txt|We were lucky to have survived.
p307_345.txt|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307_346.txt|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p307_347.txt|I just want to change my life.
p307_348.txt|He did not oppose the divorce.
p307_349.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p307_350.txt|And Michael was just great.
p307_351.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p307_352.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307_353.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p307_354.txt|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p307_355.txt|That only came out during a radio interview.
p307_356.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p307_357.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p307_358.txt|We must not go down that road.
p307_359.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p307_360.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p307_361.txt|And that match was played in June.
p307_362.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p307_363.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p307_364.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p307_365.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p307_366.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307_367.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p307_368.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p307_369.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p307_370.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p307_371.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p307_372.txt|His job was not advertised.
p307_373.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307_374.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p307_375.txt|He has changed my life for ever.
p307_376.txt|The home was now under new management.
p307_377.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307_378.txt|There is no openness.
p307_379.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p307_380.txt|It was a job he loved.
p307_381.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p307_382.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_383.txt|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p307_384.txt|It looks like paradise.
p307_386.txt|We were short of athletes.
p307_387.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307_388.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p307_389.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p307_390.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p307_391.txt|I had no qualms about it.
p307_392.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p307_393.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p307_394.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p307_395.txt|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p307_396.txt|It was early morning.
p307_397.txt|Partition is not an option.
p307_398.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p307_399.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p307_400.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307_401.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p307_402.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p307_403.txt|There was no cohesion.
p307_404.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p307_405.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p307_406.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p307_407.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p307_408.txt|I saw some good things.
p307_410.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p307_411.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p307_412.txt|But who gets on the tube?
p307_413.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p307_414.txt|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307_416.txt|So now this series has had its day.
p307_417.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307_418.txt|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p307_419.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p307_420.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p307_421.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p307_422.txt|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p307_423.txt|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p307_424.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p308_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p308_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p308_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p308_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308_008.txt|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p308_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p308_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p308_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p308_025.txt|It does make a big difference.
p308_026.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308_027.txt|Each one has its own system.
p308_028.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p308_029.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p308_030.txt|It is a very special city.
p308_031.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_032.txt|He is not very big, either.
p308_033.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p308_034.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p308_035.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_036.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308_037.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p308_038.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p308_039.txt|All of us do.
p308_040.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p308_041.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p308_042.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p308_043.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p308_044.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p308_045.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308_046.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p308_047.txt|They don't take you to mass graves.
p308_048.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p308_049.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p308_050.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p308_051.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p308_052.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p308_053.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p308_054.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308_055.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p308_056.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p308_057.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308_058.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p308_059.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p308_060.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p308_061.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p308_062.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308_063.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p308_064.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p308_065.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p308_066.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p308_067.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_068.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p308_069.txt|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308_070.txt|But it was to no avail.
p308_071.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_072.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p308_073.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p308_074.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_075.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p308_076.txt|You do have a way out.
p308_077.txt|It is simple, really.
p308_078.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_079.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p308_080.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p308_081.txt|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p308_082.txt|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p308_083.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p308_084.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p308_085.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p308_086.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p308_087.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p308_088.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308_089.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308_090.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p308_091.txt|He was a crazy man.
p308_092.txt|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p308_093.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p308_094.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308_095.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p308_096.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308_097.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p308_098.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308_099.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p308_100.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308_101.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308_102.txt|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308_103.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p308_104.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308_105.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p308_106.txt|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308_107.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p308_108.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p308_109.txt|Or so it would appear.
p308_110.txt|I hope they understand that.
p308_111.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308_112.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p308_113.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p308_114.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p308_115.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p308_116.txt|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p308_117.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p308_118.txt|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p308_119.txt|It ignores the future.
p308_120.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p308_121.txt|The trial is set for February.
p308_122.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p308_123.txt|Do not go into government buildings.
p308_124.txt|There is only one caveat.
p308_125.txt|We are still getting signals.
p308_126.txt|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p308_127.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p308_128.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p308_129.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p308_130.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p308_131.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p308_132.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p308_133.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p308_134.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p308_135.txt|The European Court is our only option.
p308_136.txt|Do you think they would do any better?
p308_137.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p308_138.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p308_139.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p308_140.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p308_141.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p308_142.txt|It will be the final push.
p308_143.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308_144.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p308_145.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p308_146.txt|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p308_147.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p308_148.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p308_149.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p308_150.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p308_151.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p308_152.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p308_153.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308_154.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p308_155.txt|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p308_156.txt|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p308_157.txt|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308_158.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p308_159.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308_160.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308_161.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308_162.txt|The red card was okay.
p308_163.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308_164.txt|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308_165.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308_166.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p308_167.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_168.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p308_169.txt|We must put a marker down.
p308_170.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308_171.txt|There is no date on this document.
p308_172.txt|And now he tells us.
p308_173.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308_174.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p308_175.txt|It is time to come into the limelight.
p308_176.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p308_177.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p308_178.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308_179.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p308_180.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308_181.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308_182.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308_183.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p308_184.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p308_185.txt|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308_186.txt|They've two children.
p308_187.txt|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308_188.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p308_189.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p308_190.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p308_191.txt|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_192.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p308_193.txt|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308_194.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p308_195.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308_196.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p308_197.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p308_198.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p308_199.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p308_200.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p308_201.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p308_202.txt|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308_203.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p308_204.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p308_205.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p308_206.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308_207.txt|Why should we even be asked to share?
p308_208.txt|Which means it matters.
p308_209.txt|There is great potential on this river.
p308_210.txt|I was surprised by his response.
p308_211.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p308_212.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p308_213.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p308_214.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308_215.txt|Is this accurate?
p308_216.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308_217.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p308_218.txt|They could go no further forward.
p308_219.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p308_220.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p308_221.txt|They make it look very easy.
p308_222.txt|It was a total surprise.
p308_223.txt|I had enough on.
p308_224.txt|And we're not there yet.
p308_225.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p308_226.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p308_227.txt|plays in dark blue.
p308_228.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308_229.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p308_230.txt|Survival is our aim.
p308_231.txt|There is no reason at all.
p308_232.txt|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p308_233.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_234.txt|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308_235.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p308_236.txt|There is a club on the rise.
p308_237.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p308_238.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p308_239.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p308_240.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p308_241.txt|There was no safety net.
p308_242.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308_243.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p308_244.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p308_245.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p308_246.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_247.txt|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p308_248.txt|He should be a great asset.
p308_249.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p308_250.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308_251.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308_252.txt|We could have got three medals.
p308_253.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p308_254.txt|We are at a crossroads.
p308_255.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p308_256.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p308_257.txt|It didn't take long.
p308_258.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_259.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p308_260.txt|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308_261.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p308_262.txt|It's not one for the purists.
p308_263.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p308_264.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p308_265.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p308_266.txt|It is a time bomb.
p308_267.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p308_268.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p308_269.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308_270.txt|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308_271.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308_272.txt|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p308_273.txt|And that's good news for the magpies.
p308_274.txt|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p308_275.txt|That got me out of jail.
p308_276.txt|We've turned the corner.
p308_277.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p308_278.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308_279.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p308_280.txt|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308_281.txt|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_282.txt|I see no need for change.
p308_283.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p308_284.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308_285.txt|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p308_286.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p308_287.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p308_288.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p308_289.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308_290.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_291.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p308_292.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p308_293.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p308_294.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p308_295.txt|We work on the same level.
p308_296.txt|I've got a young family.
p308_297.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p308_298.txt|It all seemed so easy.
p308_299.txt|I really don't understand what is happening.
p308_300.txt|The frustration was showing.
p308_301.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_302.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p308_303.txt|My friends were very envious.
p308_304.txt|The snipers are also out.
p308_305.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p308_306.txt|We're determined to establish the facts.
p308_307.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308_308.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p308_309.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p308_310.txt|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308_311.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p308_312.txt|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p308_313.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p308_314.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308_315.txt|It's like the Russians.
p308_316.txt|Is that Titanic?
p308_317.txt|Let us hope so.
p308_318.txt|So, the question is, is it any good?
p308_319.txt|I'm getting back up there now.
p308_320.txt|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308_321.txt|My players have no idea about football.
p308_322.txt|They are there to get people into work.
p308_323.txt|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p308_324.txt|They would be wise to do just that.
p308_325.txt|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308_326.txt|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308_327.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p308_328.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p308_329.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p308_330.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p308_331.txt|I'd go to bookshops.
p308_332.txt|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308_333.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p308_334.txt|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308_335.txt|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308_336.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p308_337.txt|There was no hint of bravado.
p308_338.txt|You've been a great audience.
p308_339.txt|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308_340.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p308_341.txt|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308_342.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p308_343.txt|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_344.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p308_345.txt|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p308_346.txt|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p308_347.txt|The princess has had other health problems.
p308_348.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p308_349.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p308_350.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p308_351.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p308_352.txt|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p308_353.txt|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308_354.txt|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308_355.txt|It was a UK-wide report.
p308_356.txt|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p308_357.txt|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p308_358.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308_359.txt|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_360.txt|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308_361.txt|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p308_362.txt|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p308_363.txt|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p308_364.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p308_365.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p308_366.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p308_367.txt|It is normal for me.
p308_368.txt|But it may not be all bad news.
p308_369.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p308_370.txt|I am content with the silver.
p308_371.txt|We have fun in our lives.
p308_372.txt|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308_373.txt|You have to audition for jobs.
p308_374.txt|We're not comparing like with like.
p308_375.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p308_376.txt|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_377.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p308_378.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p308_379.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p308_380.txt|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p308_381.txt|That is not just my personal view.
p308_382.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p308_383.txt|It's like a garage.
p308_384.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308_385.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p308_386.txt|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_387.txt|You just have to accept.
p308_388.txt|We've got to get it right.
p308_389.txt|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308_390.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p308_391.txt|Would you take them?
p308_392.txt|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308_393.txt|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p308_394.txt|His condition was stable last night.
p308_395.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p308_396.txt|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p308_397.txt|The report is due out next month.
p308_398.txt|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p308_399.txt|It remains in public ownership.
p308_400.txt|The Master was by then just too old.
p308_401.txt|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p308_402.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p308_403.txt|It's a very high number.
p308_404.txt|I leave tonight for England.
p308_405.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308_406.txt|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p308_407.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p308_408.txt|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_409.txt|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308_410.txt|There are simply no orders.
p308_411.txt|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308_412.txt|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p308_413.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p308_414.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p308_415.txt|She took them for a term.
p308_416.txt|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p308_417.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_418.txt|Or so she thought.
p308_419.txt|It was another good idea.
p308_420.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p308_421.txt|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_422.txt|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_423.txt|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p310_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p310_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p310_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p310_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p310_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p310_025.txt|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_026.txt|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_027.txt|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p310_028.txt|It feels like a winner already.
p310_029.txt|Did you see that?
p310_030.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310_031.txt|And the winners are.
p310_032.txt|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p310_034.txt|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p310_035.txt|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_036.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p310_037.txt|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_038.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p310_039.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p310_040.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p310_041.txt|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_042.txt|There are big names.
p310_043.txt|That argument has been won.
p310_044.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p310_045.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p310_046.txt|And who would argue with that?
p310_047.txt|I hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049.txt|They had four children together.
p310_050.txt|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_051.txt|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052.txt|I fell to the ground.
p310_053.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p310_054.txt|They were not defeated.
p310_055.txt|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p310_056.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p310_057.txt|All of us know it exists.
p310_058.txt|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059.txt|This is the band.
p310_060.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p310_061.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p310_063.txt|It is the end of an era.
p310_064.txt|We shall not do that.
p310_065.txt|I have had no social life at all.
p310_066.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067.txt|Once again, he refused.
p310_068.txt|This is about the Orange Order.
p310_069.txt|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p310_070.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p310_071.txt|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p310_072.txt|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p310_073.txt|The Commons is too outdated.
p310_074.txt|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p310_075.txt|That was then and this is now.
p310_076.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310_077.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078.txt|Are you watching Liverpool?
p310_079.txt|He would be with his peers.
p310_080.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082.txt|They don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083.txt|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p310_084.txt|I am so sorry.
p310_085.txt|This avalanche is just beginning.
p310_086.txt|Journalists should make him.
p310_087.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p310_088.txt|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310_089.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p310_090.txt|This is the best moment of my career.
p310_091.txt|He also called in at another farm.
p310_092.txt|I don't know why she is not here.
p310_093.txt|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p310_094.txt|I agree with them.
p310_095.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p310_096.txt|Now he will have to start again.
p310_097.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_098.txt|I don't know how it happened.
p310_099.txt|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_100.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p310_101.txt|Construction is due to begin in February.
p310_102.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p310_103.txt|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_104.txt|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_105.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_106.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_107.txt|Or, rather, it isn't.
p310_108.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310_109.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_110.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310_111.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310_112.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_113.txt|But there is another side.
p310_114.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_115.txt|There is no guarantee.
p310_116.txt|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_117.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p310_118.txt|It may be argued.
p310_119.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310_120.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p310_121.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p310_122.txt|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310_123.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_124.txt|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_125.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310_126.txt|This is just one example.
p310_127.txt|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_128.txt|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p310_129.txt|We stopped at half-time.
p310_130.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p310_131.txt|David was not either.
p310_132.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_133.txt|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_134.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_135.txt|No date has been set for the appeal.
p310_136.txt|He is dying from cancer.
p310_137.txt|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_138.txt|What's the rush?
p310_139.txt|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_140.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p310_141.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p310_142.txt|It was an ambush.
p310_143.txt|I think this proposal is excellent.
p310_144.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p310_145.txt|Is that too much to ask?
p310_146.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_147.txt|I've so much respect for him.
p310_148.txt|Each one has its own system.
p310_149.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p310_150.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_151.txt|And that was the adults.
p310_152.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310_153.txt|This is a job for the Government.
p310_154.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p310_155.txt|We started with that.
p310_156.txt|And he had much need.
p310_157.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_158.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p310_159.txt|It's never the same problem.
p310_160.txt|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p310_161.txt|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310_162.txt|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_163.txt|I was over the moon.
p310_164.txt|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p310_165.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p310_166.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310_167.txt|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_168.txt|And then came the seventies.
p310_169.txt|I guess it is down to focus.
p310_170.txt|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310_171.txt|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p310_172.txt|His track record is not promising.
p310_173.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p310_174.txt|He put a lot of effort into it.
p310_175.txt|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310_176.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p310_177.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_178.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p310_179.txt|The club are feeling no different today.
p310_180.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p310_181.txt|I see the extended family once a year.
p310_182.txt|I'm not a magician.
p310_183.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p310_185.txt|There was even a joke.
p310_186.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p310_187.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p310_188.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310_189.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p310_190.txt|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_191.txt|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_192.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p310_193.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p310_194.txt|I just had so much fun.
p310_195.txt|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p310_196.txt|I will wait until later.
p310_197.txt|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_198.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p310_199.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p310_200.txt|They responded with victories.
p310_201.txt|That was the personal impulse.
p310_202.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p310_203.txt|But first it goes out on TV.
p310_204.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p310_205.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p310_206.txt|I think it's awful.
p310_207.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p310_208.txt|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_209.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310_210.txt|One must hope not!
p310_211.txt|He is a Satan.
p310_212.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_213.txt|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310_214.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p310_215.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310_216.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p310_217.txt|There was no cohesion.
p310_218.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p310_219.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p310_220.txt|We will not break even.
p310_221.txt|We will look into it.
p310_222.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p310_223.txt|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_224.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p310_225.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310_226.txt|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310_227.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_228.txt|Things are moving together.
p310_229.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p310_230.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_231.txt|He must not be removed from office.
p310_232.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p310_233.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p310_234.txt|Look at the table.
p310_235.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p310_236.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310_237.txt|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_238.txt|Last year was not a good year.
p310_239.txt|It's a difficult job.
p310_240.txt|We can't get over it.
p310_241.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_242.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_243.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p310_244.txt|He saw it all as a big game.
p310_245.txt|They are not an item.
p310_246.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p310_247.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_248.txt|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_249.txt|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_250.txt|I would urge the Government to think again.
p310_251.txt|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_252.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310_253.txt|I was happiest with my short game.
p310_254.txt|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p310_255.txt|We went on to become very successful.
p310_256.txt|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310_257.txt|No, is the answer to your first question.
p310_258.txt|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p310_259.txt|That could be at least five years away.
p310_260.txt|That is my role.
p310_261.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p310_262.txt|That's the day job.
p310_263.txt|It really is taken seriously.
p310_264.txt|We have not given up hope.
p310_265.txt|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_266.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_267.txt|It's such a trial!
p310_268.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_269.txt|I think it is totally wrong.
p310_270.txt|And a film maker was born.
p310_271.txt|It was also put on the Internet.
p310_272.txt|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310_273.txt|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_274.txt|It seems to have worked.
p310_275.txt|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_276.txt|There was a battle there.
p310_277.txt|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p310_278.txt|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p310_279.txt|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_280.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p310_281.txt|THE atmosphere was electric.
p310_282.txt|I'd never heard him in person before.
p310_283.txt|We're going to change our party.
p310_284.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_285.txt|I have learned a lot from him.
p310_286.txt|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_287.txt|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_288.txt|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_289.txt|He must have something up his sleeve.
p310_290.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p310_291.txt|We make good weapons.
p310_292.txt|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p310_293.txt|This is not a Scottish problem.
p310_294.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p310_295.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310_296.txt|That was the most annoying thing.
p310_297.txt|We are being hijacked.
p310_298.txt|We had no part in it.
p310_299.txt|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310_300.txt|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310_301.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_302.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p310_303.txt|And there is no cause for it.
p310_304.txt|That would have been too easy.
p310_305.txt|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_306.txt|This is not a faceless system.
p310_307.txt|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310_308.txt|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_309.txt|It is just like the stock market.
p310_310.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p310_311.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p310_312.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_313.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p310_314.txt|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_315.txt|Most people know that.
p310_316.txt|It will be the final push.
p310_317.txt|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310_318.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p310_319.txt|The campaign was raucous.
p310_320.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p310_321.txt|But both were involved with other matters.
p310_322.txt|But we were wrong.
p310_323.txt|The result today is an impasse.
p310_324.txt|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p310_325.txt|There is no threat to them.
p310_326.txt|Nelson does not disappoint.
p310_327.txt|The goal will stay with me forever.
p310_328.txt|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310_329.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_330.txt|It is a high time to act.
p310_331.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310_332.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p310_333.txt|The South African defended his work ethic.
p310_334.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p310_335.txt|There was barely a handful of chances.
p310_336.txt|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_337.txt|I have found my vision.
p310_338.txt|We don't know the scale of need.
p310_339.txt|You need a reason for staying.
p310_340.txt|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p310_341.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p310_342.txt|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_343.txt|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p310_344.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p310_345.txt|That is not the way we should operate.
p310_346.txt|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310_347.txt|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_348.txt|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_349.txt|He showed he has some things to learn.
p310_350.txt|Or do they?
p310_351.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p310_352.txt|It is now time for justice.
p310_353.txt|That is of no use.
p310_354.txt|I could have been offended.
p310_355.txt|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_356.txt|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_357.txt|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310_358.txt|This is the lowest of the low.
p310_359.txt|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p310_360.txt|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p310_361.txt|He's a nice guy.
p310_362.txt|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_363.txt|I love the moment of being first.
p310_364.txt|It is a decision which has paid off.
p310_365.txt|Their mind was already made up.
p310_366.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310_367.txt|But it's got to be worth it.
p310_368.txt|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_369.txt|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_370.txt|Alex is a big part of that future.
p310_371.txt|Pray that is so.
p310_372.txt|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_373.txt|There was support from across the board.
p310_374.txt|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_375.txt|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310_376.txt|So what does one do?
p310_377.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p310_378.txt|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_379.txt|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_380.txt|I joined a group.
p310_381.txt|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_382.txt|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310_383.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_384.txt|And they all had these other commitments.
p310_385.txt|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p310_386.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p310_387.txt|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_388.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310_389.txt|I never agreed with that.
p310_390.txt|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_391.txt|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310_392.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_393.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p310_394.txt|There was only one hole in it.
p310_395.txt|I don't think it's vital.
p310_396.txt|It might not survive the process.
p310_397.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_398.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p310_399.txt|The issue has still to be resolved.
p310_400.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310_401.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_402.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_403.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p310_404.txt|We were close, but not close enough.
p310_405.txt|And that started me thinking.
p310_406.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p310_407.txt|It brings together two essential elements.
p310_408.txt|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p310_409.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p310_410.txt|This will help our confidence.
p310_411.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p310_412.txt|They also have good neighbours.
p310_413.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p310_414.txt|Who has he fought?
p310_415.txt|The film is about the cost of genius.
p310_416.txt|They've been here before.
p310_417.txt|I want a free vote.
p310_418.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p310_419.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p310_420.txt|I think it's a disgrace.
p310_421.txt|So he should be.
p310_422.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310_423.txt|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p310_424.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p311_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p311_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p311_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p311_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p311_025.txt|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p311_026.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p311_027.txt|It is the whole package.
p311_028.txt|I was totally wrong.
p311_029.txt|It was a matter of chance.
p311_030.txt|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p311_031.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p311_032.txt|We keep a distance.
p311_033.txt|She went home from school and never returned.
p311_034.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p311_035.txt|With actors it is slightly different.
p311_036.txt|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_037.txt|They did a very good job.
p311_038.txt|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_039.txt|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p311_040.txt|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_041.txt|We must learn to finish.
p311_042.txt|There can be no two ways about it.
p311_043.txt|I knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044.txt|I am content with the silver.
p311_045.txt|People acted too quickly.
p311_046.txt|My heart is with the artist.
p311_047.txt|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048.txt|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049.txt|What would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050.txt|They are already on the way there.
p311_051.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052.txt|This is a holy place.
p311_053.txt|We will miss him very much.
p311_054.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p311_055.txt|They should go ahead as normal.
p311_056.txt|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311_057.txt|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311_058.txt|I just went a bit too far.
p311_059.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p311_060.txt|His third goal was superb.
p311_061.txt|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062.txt|It has been declared.
p311_063.txt|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p311_064.txt|The scientific debate is dead.
p311_065.txt|Only one got through.
p311_066.txt|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311_067.txt|He is a visionary.
p311_068.txt|I was the trial judge in both.
p311_069.txt|I have a choice.
p311_070.txt|It happens in many countries.
p311_071.txt|It's not just about the shows.
p311_072.txt|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074.txt|Already the children are dying.
p311_075.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076.txt|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311_077.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p311_078.txt|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_080.txt|We've got a job to do.
p311_081.txt|You just have to adjust.
p311_082.txt|Well, that's just a third district.
p311_083.txt|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p311_084.txt|They are there to help us.
p311_085.txt|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p311_086.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p311_087.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p311_088.txt|I have hardly any commitments.
p311_089.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p311_090.txt|It is a very special place.
p311_091.txt|Some things in life you have to accept.
p311_092.txt|I am relishing the challenge.
p311_093.txt|It is set in Paris.
p311_094.txt|The party has never fully recovered.
p311_095.txt|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_096.txt|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_097.txt|The initial report has been completed.
p311_098.txt|He's got me very well.
p311_099.txt|It's like an extension of your body.
p311_100.txt|It is quite a new prescription.
p311_101.txt|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_102.txt|Which he is, too.
p311_103.txt|These matters are now behind us.
p311_104.txt|But things are never the same again.
p311_105.txt|It is easy to agree with him.
p311_106.txt|He, too, will return.
p311_107.txt|Is there anything in the wound?
p311_108.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_109.txt|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_110.txt|It is not really used by many people.
p311_111.txt|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_112.txt|He has one son and one daughter.
p311_113.txt|Don't get me wrong.
p311_114.txt|It is nearly there.
p311_115.txt|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_116.txt|I find it rather oppressive.
p311_117.txt|They are all Arabs.
p311_118.txt|It is already making a difference.
p311_119.txt|He decides to do something about it.
p311_120.txt|There were no new cases yesterday.
p311_121.txt|Someone else has now got them.
p311_122.txt|But once again it was not converted.
p311_123.txt|These figures are truly terrible.
p311_124.txt|This is a most serious matter.
p311_125.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p311_126.txt|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311_127.txt|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p311_128.txt|It was a bit of a shock.
p311_129.txt|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_130.txt|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311_131.txt|Planning is a key issue.
p311_132.txt|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_133.txt|The way ahead is not easy.
p311_134.txt|I could do a better job.
p311_135.txt|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_136.txt|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_137.txt|I get the bus.
p311_138.txt|We are still the best team in Britain.
p311_139.txt|They got the job done.
p311_140.txt|It's a horrific incident.
p311_141.txt|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311_142.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311_143.txt|We've not won anything yet.
p311_144.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_145.txt|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p311_146.txt|They did not let him down.
p311_147.txt|I believe in trade unions.
p311_148.txt|This is in a league of its own.
p311_149.txt|It's been such a waste of money.
p311_150.txt|The money is not really our concern.
p311_151.txt|You just know it.
p311_152.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p311_153.txt|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_154.txt|We have the easy part.
p311_155.txt|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p311_156.txt|It's like a high school play.
p311_157.txt|He was part of South Africa.
p311_158.txt|It's there for people to look at.
p311_159.txt|The party will make up its own mind.
p311_160.txt|At least two women were among those arrested.
p311_161.txt|They never got into the show this time.
p311_162.txt|But no, it's not funny.
p311_163.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311_164.txt|He changed my life.
p311_165.txt|There was nothing else to match it.
p311_166.txt|Two options are being proposed.
p311_167.txt|They haven't been thought through.
p311_168.txt|The criteria have changed.
p311_169.txt|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p311_170.txt|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311_171.txt|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_172.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p311_173.txt|This is a very interesting move.
p311_174.txt|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_175.txt|His only reply was a laugh.
p311_176.txt|those who are preparing to give up.
p311_177.txt|What kind of festival is proposed?
p311_178.txt|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_179.txt|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311_180.txt|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p311_181.txt|That will help my case a bit.
p311_182.txt|It was entirely justified.
p311_183.txt|He looked at me before replying.
p311_184.txt|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_185.txt|It feels that the game is off.
p311_186.txt|There will be no change in government.
p311_187.txt|Another man said, It was horrible.
p311_188.txt|But we still don't know.
p311_189.txt|Who do you think you are?
p311_190.txt|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_191.txt|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_192.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p311_193.txt|I have done ever since it was published.
p311_194.txt|Nobody could survive on that.
p311_195.txt|They seem to turn up for them.
p311_196.txt|They were kept there for a summer.
p311_197.txt|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_198.txt|It is that sort of film.
p311_199.txt|She was not hard done by.
p311_200.txt|Can you believe it?
p311_201.txt|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311_202.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p311_203.txt|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p311_204.txt|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_205.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p311_206.txt|This has been a shock.
p311_207.txt|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_208.txt|Everything in the symphony is there.
p311_209.txt|There has also been some Scots input.
p311_210.txt|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p311_211.txt|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_212.txt|But who will buy it?
p311_213.txt|It had to be more flexible.
p311_214.txt|Openness is always the best way.
p311_215.txt|It wouldn't go off.
p311_216.txt|It can be halted.
p311_217.txt|This was a lot of numbers.
p311_218.txt|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311_219.txt|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_220.txt|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_221.txt|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_222.txt|The professor said the results were positive.
p311_223.txt|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p311_224.txt|But it's just great to have won.
p311_225.txt|And it paid off.
p311_226.txt|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_227.txt|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311_228.txt|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_229.txt|It should be scrapped.
p311_230.txt|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_231.txt|They are just trying to cover up.
p311_232.txt|We have to defend ourselves.
p311_233.txt|I came here this week to work.
p311_234.txt|Where do we go from here?
p311_235.txt|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_236.txt|He gets his moment.
p311_237.txt|This was an option from the beginning.
p311_238.txt|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_239.txt|It's not a party, no, no.
p311_240.txt|It's not that clear-cut.
p311_241.txt|It may not be life long.
p311_242.txt|It was just above the roof.
p311_243.txt|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311_244.txt|However, that is a sizeable if.
p311_245.txt|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_246.txt|The English are coming.
p311_247.txt|I believe in theatre.
p311_248.txt|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249.txt|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311_250.txt|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p311_252.txt|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_253.txt|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_254.txt|That's my daughter acting.
p311_255.txt|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_256.txt|The performance was really, really immense.
p311_257.txt|Faces from the Eighties.
p311_258.txt|The family baton is handed on.
p311_259.txt|How can this be?
p311_260.txt|We are still alive and kicking.
p311_261.txt|I want to go now.
p311_262.txt|There are many questions to be answered.
p311_263.txt|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_264.txt|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_265.txt|They said we were out of touch.
p311_266.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311_267.txt|There is no signature.
p311_268.txt|There is no point in denying that.
p311_269.txt|The kids are paying the price.
p311_270.txt|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_271.txt|They didn't find any substance.
p311_272.txt|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_273.txt|I've never seen a game like it.
p311_274.txt|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_275.txt|He will do very well.
p311_276.txt|They also intend to travel today.
p311_277.txt|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_278.txt|The casualties were not named.
p311_279.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p311_280.txt|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_281.txt|I am very happy with life.
p311_282.txt|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_283.txt|My office is down there.
p311_284.txt|Even then this game was not over.
p311_285.txt|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_286.txt|We also hope to meet the men.
p311_287.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p311_288.txt|It has become very confused.
p311_289.txt|Fame and money followed.
p311_290.txt|I am not in denial.
p311_291.txt|Shelter also supports the reform.
p311_292.txt|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_293.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p311_294.txt|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_295.txt|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_296.txt|Then there's the Old Firm.
p311_297.txt|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_298.txt|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311_299.txt|They're not always the same person.
p311_300.txt|It would have to be backdated.
p311_301.txt|He said he was sorry.
p311_302.txt|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_303.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p311_304.txt|We have worked well with them for years.
p311_305.txt|That was me today.
p311_306.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_307.txt|That is when we are really effective.
p311_308.txt|The director's a genius.
p311_309.txt|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_310.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p311_311.txt|This is new money.
p311_312.txt|We have not given up on the game.
p311_313.txt|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_314.txt|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311_315.txt|Nobody should believe this story.
p311_316.txt|This is not out of choice.
p311_317.txt|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311_318.txt|But this one has a lot of potential.
p311_319.txt|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_320.txt|We'll see what happens.
p311_321.txt|This was another video cassette.
p311_322.txt|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311_323.txt|It will make a huge difference.
p311_324.txt|He pretended not to care.
p311_325.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p311_326.txt|I was in tears in the street.
p311_327.txt|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311_328.txt|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_329.txt|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_330.txt|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311_331.txt|That is why we are here.
p311_332.txt|The German had a point to make.
p311_333.txt|This time, however, may have been different.
p311_334.txt|You have to feel for the guy.
p311_335.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311_336.txt|Bomber was not amused.
p311_337.txt|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_338.txt|Was it just negligent.
p311_339.txt|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_340.txt|This Government is cutting taxes.
p311_341.txt|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_342.txt|This is a big club.
p311_343.txt|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311_344.txt|They will now get that support.
p311_345.txt|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_346.txt|It seemed so personal.
p311_347.txt|I've no problem with what they said.
p311_348.txt|He added that he felt undermined.
p311_349.txt|I think we have got the balance right.
p311_350.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p311_351.txt|It is physical but it is also good.
p311_352.txt|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_353.txt|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_354.txt|So it goes on.
p311_355.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311_356.txt|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_357.txt|They should have listened to me.
p311_358.txt|I am greatly encouraged.
p311_359.txt|It was like someone had died.
p311_360.txt|What does he want him to look like?
p311_361.txt|The actors are confident and polished.
p311_362.txt|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_363.txt|We would have concerns about that.
p311_364.txt|Taxes may need to rise.
p311_365.txt|It's unusual to say the least.
p311_366.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_367.txt|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_368.txt|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_369.txt|We have some concerns.
p311_370.txt|So he was anxious to try something new.
p311_371.txt|This was a chilling echo.
p311_372.txt|They really want to do it.
p311_373.txt|And then he laughs.
p311_374.txt|I recommend a tour.
p311_375.txt|We don't ask for much.
p311_376.txt|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311_377.txt|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_378.txt|We have to start again on Saturday.
p311_379.txt|It feels like a winner already.
p311_380.txt|And it covers the spectrum.
p311_381.txt|The replacements made a big difference.
p311_382.txt|And the winners are.
p311_383.txt|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311_384.txt|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p311_385.txt|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_386.txt|There are big names.
p311_387.txt|My players are precious to me.
p311_388.txt|That argument has been won.
p311_389.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311_390.txt|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311_391.txt|I had to calm down.
p311_392.txt|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_393.txt|She returned home a few days later.
p311_394.txt|They haven't run away.
p311_395.txt|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_396.txt|She is fulfilled by it.
p311_397.txt|He said no survivors had been found.
p311_398.txt|Who can say?
p311_399.txt|It is the end of an era.
p311_400.txt|In short, the club was broke.
p311_401.txt|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311_402.txt|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_403.txt|The men are safe and unharmed.
p311_404.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p311_405.txt|It was the same old story.
p311_406.txt|I was frustrated here.
p311_407.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p311_408.txt|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_409.txt|I was furious about it.
p311_410.txt|This will be no easy option.
p311_411.txt|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_412.txt|Of course we aren't.
p311_413.txt|We haven't been told.
p311_414.txt|It worked well in Monaco.
p311_415.txt|They were outside the circle.
p311_416.txt|The whole process was so different.
p311_417.txt|He also called in at another farm.
p311_418.txt|I agree with them.
p311_419.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p311_420.txt|We will listen to colleagues.
p311_421.txt|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_422.txt|It's something we want to make work.
p311_423.txt|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p312_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p312_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p312_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p312_025.txt|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_026.txt|This was a rationing decision.
p312_027.txt|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_028.txt|He is doing the right things.
p312_029.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p312_030.txt|I've got the poster.
p312_031.txt|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_032.txt|We have a high quality product.
p312_033.txt|Haven't been so lucky since.
p312_034.txt|Well, you might have a point.
p312_035.txt|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_036.txt|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_037.txt|That decision is now being appealed.
p312_038.txt|This is really good news for us.
p312_039.txt|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312_040.txt|Not so, it transpires.
p312_041.txt|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_042.txt|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_043.txt|I think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044.txt|This is not a monument to the past.
p312_045.txt|I certainly hope not.
p312_046.txt|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_047.txt|I feel pretty good.
p312_048.txt|The group will report back in the summer.
p312_049.txt|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p312_051.txt|I was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p312_053.txt|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312_054.txt|The children are being very brave.
p312_055.txt|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056.txt|My only concern is for my children.
p312_057.txt|This is welcome news.
p312_058.txt|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059.txt|The trust has no magic wand.
p312_060.txt|We just wish they had done so before.
p312_061.txt|It was a virus.
p312_062.txt|The rest, of course, is history.
p312_063.txt|They chose the latter.
p312_064.txt|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312_065.txt|All were later allowed home.
p312_066.txt|Will you just put it away?
p312_067.txt|I think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p312_069.txt|It is still with Ministers.
p312_070.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p312_071.txt|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312_072.txt|It showed him the way to drive.
p312_073.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074.txt|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p312_075.txt|Were they under-age?
p312_076.txt|He was charged with perjury.
p312_077.txt|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312_078.txt|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312_079.txt|The goal will come.
p312_080.txt|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081.txt|We didn't take our chances.
p312_082.txt|It was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083.txt|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_084.txt|There are many children.
p312_085.txt|That never seemed likely.
p312_086.txt|Action must be taken urgently.
p312_087.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p312_088.txt|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_089.txt|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312_090.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_091.txt|But these things are happening now.
p312_092.txt|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_093.txt|They should be swept away.
p312_094.txt|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_095.txt|It will be a challenging film.
p312_096.txt|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_097.txt|What happens next?
p312_098.txt|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312_099.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p312_100.txt|The plot is minimal.
p312_101.txt|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_102.txt|They're just a nonsense.
p312_103.txt|There may be some resistance.
p312_104.txt|I could not believe it.
p312_105.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312_106.txt|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_107.txt|He will go a long way.
p312_108.txt|Then there was her childhood.
p312_109.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p312_110.txt|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_111.txt|It's so much more fun.
p312_112.txt|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_113.txt|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312_114.txt|Where do you think she is going?
p312_115.txt|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_116.txt|I am not against a further inquiry.
p312_117.txt|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_118.txt|It's a double whammy.
p312_119.txt|What's the theme?
p312_120.txt|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_121.txt|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312_122.txt|This latter suggestion is very important.
p312_123.txt|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_124.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p312_125.txt|There was some merit in that.
p312_126.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_127.txt|What's wrong with that?
p312_128.txt|The pain is still acute.
p312_129.txt|His remit is specific.
p312_130.txt|It is a very big problem.
p312_131.txt|Frustration is not the word.
p312_132.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p312_133.txt|She was extremely rigid.
p312_134.txt|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p312_135.txt|But what lies ahead?
p312_136.txt|I am so upset.
p312_137.txt|I was blown out of proportion.
p312_138.txt|There was a definite prejudice.
p312_139.txt|It's the same with us.
p312_140.txt|It's an awful lot of money.
p312_141.txt|He was the architect.
p312_142.txt|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_143.txt|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_144.txt|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_145.txt|He, too, was not satisfied.
p312_146.txt|It's easy to see why.
p312_147.txt|I've never regretted coming here.
p312_148.txt|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p312_149.txt|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312_150.txt|We still have a long, long way to go.
p312_151.txt|I fell into it by accident.
p312_152.txt|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_153.txt|Where does it come from?
p312_154.txt|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312_155.txt|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p312_156.txt|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_157.txt|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_158.txt|That says something for his strength of character.
p312_159.txt|The world is being invited to visit.
p312_160.txt|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312_161.txt|I think it's a sensible change.
p312_162.txt|Sex is fun?
p312_163.txt|I'm not sure.
p312_164.txt|His first album was a hit.
p312_165.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p312_166.txt|And who would argue with that?
p312_167.txt|It was visibly on fire.
p312_168.txt|What's it for, after all?
p312_169.txt|Who would be out there, singing?
p312_170.txt|A number of people could not speak English.
p312_171.txt|They have got off with murder.
p312_172.txt|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_173.txt|This remains the party's policy.
p312_174.txt|I cannot say anymore.
p312_175.txt|They want this research to continue.
p312_176.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p312_177.txt|They are going to carry it through.
p312_178.txt|It was very, very dejected.
p312_179.txt|You can't keep them separate.
p312_180.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p312_181.txt|He was a legend.
p312_182.txt|That's when the story first appeared.
p312_183.txt|You're going to die.
p312_184.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p312_185.txt|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_186.txt|I'm going to see my friend.
p312_187.txt|We played too deeply.
p312_188.txt|I probably would have been a dancer.
p312_189.txt|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_190.txt|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_191.txt|He never asked me for money.
p312_192.txt|I was a bit nervous.
p312_193.txt|There was no question of him not impressing.
p312_194.txt|However, we came through.
p312_195.txt|I love this tournament.
p312_196.txt|He had a heart problem.
p312_197.txt|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312_198.txt|It is a large number.
p312_199.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p312_200.txt|Hear what they have to say.
p312_201.txt|Now there's a thought.
p312_202.txt|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_203.txt|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312_204.txt|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_205.txt|They told him to go to drama school.
p312_206.txt|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_207.txt|Let us hope so.
p312_208.txt|She looked very settled.
p312_209.txt|Of course he was right!
p312_210.txt|The next few months will tell.
p312_211.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_212.txt|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_213.txt|You can see their point.
p312_214.txt|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312_215.txt|The dangers are very obvious.
p312_216.txt|There were no casualties.
p312_217.txt|Is it in the right place?
p312_218.txt|I played well in my time there.
p312_219.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312_220.txt|They are still going to be impulsive.
p312_221.txt|I love you so very much.
p312_222.txt|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_223.txt|He is a very nice man.
p312_224.txt|We want to sort it out.
p312_225.txt|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_226.txt|Such a city does not exist.
p312_227.txt|It made me determined to get back.
p312_228.txt|It was no avail.
p312_229.txt|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_230.txt|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_231.txt|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_232.txt|That is in the very nature of farming.
p312_233.txt|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312_234.txt|It was worth the wait.
p312_235.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_236.txt|It will take place in July.
p312_237.txt|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_238.txt|This is a major step forward for carers.
p312_239.txt|I think it was his parents.
p312_240.txt|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_241.txt|Partly, it is his own fault.
p312_242.txt|It's a personal matter.
p312_243.txt|That's where it all started.
p312_244.txt|I won't go back.
p312_245.txt|Why has it taken so long?
p312_246.txt|You make the choice.
p312_247.txt|And does it?
p312_248.txt|I was proud of our lads.
p312_249.txt|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_250.txt|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_251.txt|All would be under threat.
p312_252.txt|Was it a foul?
p312_253.txt|He leaves a beat.
p312_254.txt|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_255.txt|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_256.txt|Promises were not kept.
p312_257.txt|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312_258.txt|The claim was denied by first minister.
p312_259.txt|Who is he?
p312_260.txt|It has to be long-term commitment.
p312_261.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p312_262.txt|That would be a big mistake.
p312_263.txt|His arrival could be the making of them.
p312_264.txt|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312_265.txt|I said How much?
p312_266.txt|You are a liar.
p312_267.txt|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_268.txt|We're still talking about it.
p312_269.txt|She would say he was still the best.
p312_270.txt|He finished the night in a cell.
p312_271.txt|I'm not afraid of that.
p312_272.txt|I don't know what he was shouting.
p312_273.txt|It is the icing on the cake.
p312_274.txt|It was a new ball game.
p312_275.txt|The people here are quite reserved.
p312_276.txt|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_277.txt|Our legal advice is clear.
p312_278.txt|The past is history, not destiny.
p312_279.txt|These were the edited highlights.
p312_280.txt|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_281.txt|They were totally behind it.
p312_282.txt|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312_283.txt|We could do a lot worse.
p312_284.txt|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_285.txt|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_286.txt|It is all one-sided.
p312_287.txt|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312_288.txt|That was the initial attraction.
p312_289.txt|Who will take them after that?
p312_290.txt|He's also thinking long-term.
p312_291.txt|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_292.txt|Trevor has been great.
p312_293.txt|It would also take time.
p312_294.txt|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p312_295.txt|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p312_296.txt|I was first in the door.
p312_297.txt|It is highly unlikely.
p312_298.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p312_299.txt|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_300.txt|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312_301.txt|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_302.txt|What makes a house a home?
p312_303.txt|Destruction came from within.
p312_304.txt|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312_305.txt|It is good to look back.
p312_306.txt|You can't do one without the other.
p312_307.txt|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_308.txt|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312_309.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_310.txt|I would say so.
p312_311.txt|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312_312.txt|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p312_313.txt|And they did just that.
p312_314.txt|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_315.txt|She has left the island.
p312_316.txt|They had three children.
p312_317.txt|Our system is archaic.
p312_318.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p312_319.txt|We want to know about the policy.
p312_320.txt|It is not illegal.
p312_321.txt|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_322.txt|We don't have the credible evidence.
p312_323.txt|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312_324.txt|It's one up to the Scots.
p312_325.txt|This is complete nonsense.
p312_326.txt|I don't want to use the term.
p312_327.txt|There is still hope.
p312_328.txt|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_329.txt|It's all happening at a local level.
p312_330.txt|She is a great talent.
p312_331.txt|It's the big omission.
p312_332.txt|We do things in an appropriate way.
p312_334.txt|However, she is female, and so.
p312_335.txt|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_336.txt|He will be advised by me.
p312_337.txt|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_338.txt|It's part of your life.
p312_339.txt|He had a horror.
p312_340.txt|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_341.txt|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_342.txt|That was the biggest game of my life.
p312_343.txt|This is perfectly legal.
p312_344.txt|That's the most important thing for me.
p312_345.txt|Then came the second round.
p312_346.txt|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312_347.txt|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_348.txt|We told them in June.
p312_349.txt|Parents should avoid it.
p312_350.txt|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p312_351.txt|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_352.txt|And she's not even in the book!
p312_353.txt|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_354.txt|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_355.txt|He, too, is killing.
p312_356.txt|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_357.txt|It's better to be happy.
p312_358.txt|It's just so sad.
p312_359.txt|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312_360.txt|And Scotland is no different.
p312_361.txt|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_362.txt|We are in a learning curve.
p312_363.txt|He can do everything.
p312_364.txt|She was just that sort of person.
p312_365.txt|Is it a warning to parents?
p312_366.txt|You've gotten all the facts.
p312_367.txt|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_368.txt|Soon the whole country will be level.
p312_369.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312_370.txt|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_371.txt|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_372.txt|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p312_373.txt|He said he needed no more evidence.
p312_374.txt|It's such a tragedy.
p312_375.txt|It was a long time coming.
p312_376.txt|Gordon Brown was superb.
p312_377.txt|The referee didn't do his job.
p312_378.txt|We are very nearly there.
p312_379.txt|Stand by for action.
p312_380.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_381.txt|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312_382.txt|The urgency is real.
p312_383.txt|They have been for some time now.
p312_384.txt|It was only logical to end it.
p312_385.txt|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p312_386.txt|I've no passion for any country.
p312_387.txt|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312_388.txt|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389.txt|That's an old idea.
p312_390.txt|It is part and parcel of it.
p312_391.txt|The only safe investment is cash.
p312_392.txt|It's the whole season.
p312_393.txt|We had no choice but to go down.
p312_394.txt|We are keen to have him back.
p312_395.txt|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_396.txt|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p312_397.txt|And we all understand that.
p312_398.txt|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_399.txt|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p312_400.txt|Do what you have to do.
p312_401.txt|We must do well in that.
p312_402.txt|She died later on Monday.
p312_403.txt|No-one has yet been charged.
p312_404.txt|If so, they were wrong.
p312_405.txt|This is my big break.
p312_406.txt|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_407.txt|There is no easy answer.
p312_408.txt|There was someone on the floor.
p312_409.txt|I put pressure on him.
p312_410.txt|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_411.txt|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_412.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_413.txt|He will never walk the streets again.
p312_414.txt|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_415.txt|Golf has lost a great character.
p312_416.txt|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_417.txt|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312_418.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p312_419.txt|There was no pressure at all.
p313_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p313_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p313_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p313_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p313_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p313_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p313_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p313_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313_018.txt|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p313_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p313_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p313_025.txt|They will be dealt with.
p313_026.txt|It is never an easy game.
p313_027.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p313_028.txt|I intend to raise the matter there.
p313_029.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p313_030.txt|We have to put this behind us.
p313_031.txt|I thought it was quite good.
p313_032.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p313_033.txt|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p313_034.txt|That is impressive by any standards.
p313_035.txt|We are doing very well as we are.
p313_036.txt|The waiting is over, well almost.
p313_037.txt|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p313_038.txt|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p313_039.txt|It helped me to get noticed.
p313_040.txt|They hit me in the head.
p313_041.txt|But he is not using them.
p313_042.txt|That, though, was just the start of it.
p313_043.txt|We are not moving in.
p313_044.txt|We have not had a formal request.
p313_045.txt|I never had a childhood.
p313_046.txt|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_047.txt|We offered something different.
p313_048.txt|We were very much a happy family.
p313_049.txt|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_050.txt|My brother's buried under there.
p313_051.txt|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_052.txt|What were they?
p313_053.txt|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_054.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p313_055.txt|Her role in it was small.
p313_056.txt|I've really noticed that this week.
p313_057.txt|We might be back next year.
p313_058.txt|In a way he was.
p313_059.txt|It's back to how it used to be.
p313_060.txt|It is not a standing army.
p313_061.txt|The firm was down and almost out.
p313_062.txt|They said they were only young men.
p313_063.txt|I was chosen to do this.
p313_064.txt|I learned a lot from that.
p313_065.txt|The house was so well alight.
p313_066.txt|He got his degree.
p313_067.txt|Sandy was very active.
p313_068.txt|However, there is great potential in this right.
p313_069.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_070.txt|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_071.txt|There were no formal announcements.
p313_072.txt|Before the games it was pretty open.
p313_073.txt|It really has left the town in shock.
p313_074.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p313_075.txt|I'm so worried about the roads.
p313_076.txt|This was much worse.
p313_077.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p313_078.txt|We are confident of taking that back.
p313_079.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p313_080.txt|Did they give any good advice?
p313_081.txt|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_082.txt|This does not help.
p313_083.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p313_084.txt|That's why the ministers resigned.
p313_085.txt|He has lost confidence and weight.
p313_086.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313_087.txt|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313_088.txt|This could be her way forward.
p313_089.txt|This gives us a lot of practice.
p313_090.txt|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p313_091.txt|It's a very, very special day.
p313_092.txt|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_093.txt|There's also the point.
p313_094.txt|It was forced to divert.
p313_095.txt|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p313_096.txt|That's the National Grid.
p313_097.txt|But Allen is deadly serious.
p313_098.txt|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p313_099.txt|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313_100.txt|They've just got to believe in themselves.
p313_101.txt|This is my personal assessment.
p313_102.txt|There was no trouble at all.
p313_103.txt|Although, you never know.
p313_104.txt|We shall be victorious.
p313_105.txt|The quality of work is very impressive.
p313_106.txt|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p313_107.txt|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p313_108.txt|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p313_109.txt|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313_110.txt|I took the gun.
p313_111.txt|It's just one of those things.
p313_112.txt|A web site is planned for November.
p313_113.txt|We played so well at times.
p313_114.txt|I was very fortunate.
p313_115.txt|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_116.txt|We act because we must.
p313_117.txt|They will be destroyed.
p313_118.txt|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313_119.txt|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_120.txt|The Tory party will last.
p313_121.txt|It was a journey into a new life.
p313_122.txt|It's a way of making a mark.
p313_123.txt|There is a great carry over value.
p313_124.txt|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p313_125.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p313_126.txt|What's the point?
p313_127.txt|Why is this?
p313_128.txt|What has changed since then?
p313_129.txt|Raymond was always on the outside.
p313_130.txt|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p313_131.txt|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313_132.txt|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_133.txt|I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_134.txt|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p313_135.txt|I mean it happens.
p313_136.txt|This week is a perfect example.
p313_137.txt|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_138.txt|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p313_139.txt|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p313_140.txt|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_141.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p313_142.txt|It's typical of me.
p313_143.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p313_144.txt|They played it like a cup final.
p313_145.txt|However, it's not all bad news for women.
p313_146.txt|But the championship is not over yet.
p313_147.txt|We haven't found out anything different.
p313_148.txt|A review of the decision is being sought.
p313_149.txt|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p313_150.txt|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p313_151.txt|Surely it can do better than that?
p313_152.txt|I am ashamed of them.
p313_153.txt|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p313_154.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p313_155.txt|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p313_156.txt|If so, we want to hear from them.
p313_157.txt|I'm not blaming audiences.
p313_158.txt|Who was on the panel?
p313_159.txt|They may differ on other issues.
p313_160.txt|He'd never run the distance before.
p313_161.txt|I can make one further announcement.
p313_162.txt|The General Election is all to play for.
p313_163.txt|It was a fiery game.
p313_164.txt|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p313_165.txt|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313_166.txt|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p313_167.txt|It will not be easy for him.
p313_168.txt|This one is a special case.
p313_169.txt|But what are the songs about?
p313_170.txt|There is a simmering anger out there.
p313_171.txt|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p313_172.txt|That is not a position they enjoy.
p313_173.txt|The stadium was full.
p313_174.txt|Dewar is the medium.
p313_175.txt|It was that kind of night.
p313_176.txt|It is very much a matter for them.
p313_177.txt|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_178.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p313_179.txt|He's got a great chance of making it.
p313_180.txt|We won't do that.
p313_181.txt|I hope we do.
p313_182.txt|From now on there is no hiding place.
p313_183.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_184.txt|He quit in October.
p313_185.txt|The United Nations must act.
p313_186.txt|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313_187.txt|Her daughter is getting married.
p313_188.txt|His manager blamed the referee.
p313_189.txt|They were that poor.
p313_190.txt|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_191.txt|We have understood the problems for some time.
p313_192.txt|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_193.txt|All these things have an impact.
p313_194.txt|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313_195.txt|They believed it worked.
p313_196.txt|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
p313_197.txt|They should feel ashamed.
p313_198.txt|This is a really serious issue.
p313_199.txt|So they will settle again.
p313_200.txt|How do we get more people in?
p313_201.txt|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p313_202.txt|It looks as though there is no chance.
p313_203.txt|This is not a European Army.
p313_204.txt|Election results are expected soon.
p313_205.txt|So she told him.
p313_206.txt|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_207.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p313_208.txt|It was good to score the goal today.
p313_209.txt|The night is young.
p313_210.txt|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p313_211.txt|I suspect that it will.
p313_212.txt|But there's no eye contact.
p313_213.txt|The squad will be the same for France.
p313_214.txt|We are a party for people, not against people.
p313_215.txt|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_216.txt|We're still paying the price for that.
p313_217.txt|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p313_218.txt|It's not a wish list.
p313_219.txt|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p313_220.txt|Some of the players have not progressed.
p313_221.txt|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p313_222.txt|If not, he should go home.
p313_223.txt|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p313_224.txt|There is no margin for error.
p313_225.txt|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p313_226.txt|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p313_227.txt|That figure will always remain with me.
p313_228.txt|And then a funny thing happened.
p313_229.txt|It doesn't take much.
p313_230.txt|She asked us a lot of questions.
p313_231.txt|It was a stunning strike.
p313_232.txt|It is a technique.
p313_233.txt|They hold on for many years.
p313_234.txt|Is it the shape of things to come?
p313_235.txt|My body is exhausted.
p313_236.txt|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313_237.txt|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p313_238.txt|There is nothing to fear.
p313_239.txt|I was an athlete.
p313_240.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p313_241.txt|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_242.txt|I tried to push him away.
p313_243.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313_244.txt|This was done by the council staff.
p313_245.txt|The truth is otherwise.
p313_246.txt|We haven't come out of this very well.
p313_247.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p313_248.txt|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p313_249.txt|We should be rewarded for producing.
p313_250.txt|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p313_251.txt|Which, in effect, it is.
p313_252.txt|The man became a reporter.
p313_253.txt|It is a memorial.
p313_254.txt|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313_255.txt|Our people are paying high prices.
p313_256.txt|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_257.txt|Nor is it likely to do so.
p313_258.txt|Or so everyone believed.
p313_259.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p313_260.txt|I read it every year.
p313_261.txt|He was in contention almost every week.
p313_262.txt|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p313_263.txt|It's up to Ann.
p313_264.txt|We are playing them at their own game.
p313_265.txt|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313_266.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p313_267.txt|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p313_268.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_269.txt|The conference is the first test.
p313_270.txt|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p313_271.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p313_272.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p313_273.txt|There is no more money.
p313_274.txt|My mother is a widow.
p313_275.txt|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313_276.txt|There have been different reports from different people.
p313_277.txt|It's an absolute disgrace.
p313_278.txt|Something was plainly wrong.
p313_279.txt|Why should he go anywhere?
p313_280.txt|One thing is sure.
p313_281.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p313_282.txt|I'm confident we can do that.
p313_283.txt|Funding needs to be long term.
p313_284.txt|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p313_285.txt|I would never even consider it.
p313_286.txt|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p313_287.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p313_288.txt|We have it on video.
p313_289.txt|I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_290.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p313_291.txt|It's never over until it's over.
p313_292.txt|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p313_293.txt|This year, it was a little different.
p313_294.txt|That, though, is to miss the point.
p313_295.txt|We gave them the goal.
p313_296.txt|Is being naturally funny enough?
p313_297.txt|What's the point of staying sober?
p313_298.txt|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p313_299.txt|The incident is being taken seriously.
p313_300.txt|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p313_301.txt|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p313_302.txt|I can feel the sound inside.
p313_303.txt|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313_304.txt|I'm not a fan of books.
p313_305.txt|SO now we know the secret.
p313_306.txt|It may well have been.
p313_307.txt|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313_308.txt|It was a simple question.
p313_309.txt|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_310.txt|And we've beaten them before.
p313_311.txt|Could you put it in writing?
p313_312.txt|I'm not a paedophile.
p313_313.txt|Some of their movement was excellent.
p313_314.txt|But they had to be paid for.
p313_315.txt|The odds are that it will.
p313_316.txt|But then they scored their fourth.
p313_317.txt|They deserve a lot of credit.
p313_318.txt|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313_319.txt|Why is that?
p313_320.txt|Then came the crunch.
p313_321.txt|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_322.txt|But will they fall in love?
p313_323.txt|As if they ever stopped.
p313_324.txt|The referee had a shocking game.
p313_325.txt|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_326.txt|For a few years we had good fun.
p313_327.txt|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_328.txt|It went on to become an annual event.
p313_329.txt|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313_330.txt|We are now in an election period.
p313_331.txt|Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_332.txt|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313_333.txt|But when we do it is great.
p313_334.txt|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_335.txt|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_336.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p313_339.txt|I can't believe the buzz.
p313_340.txt|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313_341.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p313_342.txt|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p313_343.txt|It's no less intriguing, however.
p313_344.txt|It's a question of perception.
p313_345.txt|Staff have been informed.
p313_346.txt|My heart is not so sure.
p313_347.txt|This morning was very quiet.
p313_348.txt|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p313_349.txt|It's been handled entirely properly.
p313_350.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p313_351.txt|That might help a bit.
p313_352.txt|Two others were also seriously injured.
p313_353.txt|He was made redundant in February of last year.
p313_354.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p313_355.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p313_356.txt|You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_357.txt|It seems very odd.
p313_358.txt|Closure is not one of them.
p313_359.txt|The hotel was huge.
p313_360.txt|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p313_361.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p313_362.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p313_363.txt|This is an internal matter.
p313_364.txt|I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_365.txt|They took a risk.
p313_366.txt|The idea was presented to me.
p313_367.txt|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p313_368.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313_369.txt|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313_370.txt|The hearing was fair.
p313_371.txt|I see it as my job.
p313_372.txt|This was not a summit about the euro.
p313_373.txt|Frank Warren is a great man.
p313_374.txt|I'm a little bit tired.
p313_375.txt|That was never their agenda.
p313_376.txt|She died at her home.
p313_377.txt|She's currently in foster care.
p313_378.txt|That's the only thing that matters.
p313_379.txt|I enjoy the creative process.
p313_380.txt|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313_381.txt|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p313_382.txt|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p313_383.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p313_384.txt|We have been preparing all year.
p313_385.txt|We could learn a lot from them.
p313_386.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p313_387.txt|Sure, we have problems.
p313_388.txt|I was released after six days.
p313_389.txt|That time is not far away.
p313_390.txt|I may think about performing it.
p313_391.txt|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_392.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313_393.txt|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p313_394.txt|You can't go back and change things.
p313_395.txt|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_396.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p313_397.txt|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p313_398.txt|He says it often enough.
p313_399.txt|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313_400.txt|His primary residence is Scotland.
p313_401.txt|I found that much more challenging.
p313_402.txt|This fight is not going to go away.
p313_403.txt|It would have been very easily done.
p313_404.txt|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p313_405.txt|The Open champion is back.
p313_406.txt|It's going to be a new challenge.
p313_407.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p313_408.txt|I want to keep him.
p313_409.txt|He deserves a top team.
p313_410.txt|I knew people on that committee.
p313_411.txt|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_412.txt|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p313_413.txt|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p313_414.txt|We never agreed to it.
p313_415.txt|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313_416.txt|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p313_417.txt|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313_418.txt|Would they work together again?
p313_419.txt|I didn't play all that well.
p313_420.txt|Who can tell?
p313_421.txt|It appears to have been closed down.
p313_422.txt|Now, that is a good deal.
p313_423.txt|The whole nation will be delighted.
p314_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p314_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p314_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p314_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p314_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p314_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p314_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p314_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p314_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p314_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p314_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p314_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p314_025.txt|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p314_026.txt|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p314_027.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p314_028.txt|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p314_029.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p314_030.txt|I believe in the Church.
p314_031.txt|We are just being flooded.
p314_032.txt|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p314_033.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_034.txt|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p314_035.txt|Well, what do you know?
p314_036.txt|But she was very human.
p314_037.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314_038.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p314_039.txt|His concern is only for the future.
p314_040.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p314_041.txt|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p314_042.txt|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
p314_043.txt|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_044.txt|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314_045.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p314_046.txt|That view has not altered.
p314_047.txt|I only half believe it.
p314_048.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p314_049.txt|All the oil companies are talking together.
p314_050.txt|We have no choice but to shut down.
p314_051.txt|I'm feeling pretty good.
p314_052.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p314_053.txt|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p314_054.txt|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p314_055.txt|It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314_056.txt|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p314_057.txt|It is not normal practice.
p314_058.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p314_059.txt|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314_060.txt|What happens next?
p314_061.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p314_062.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p314_063.txt|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_064.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p314_065.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p314_066.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p314_067.txt|Let's see that increase over the years.
p314_068.txt|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p314_069.txt|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314_070.txt|These findings would be made public.
p314_071.txt|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_072.txt|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_073.txt|You can't go on forever.
p314_074.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p314_075.txt|So far this season this approach is working.
p314_076.txt|I have got a knife.
p314_077.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p314_078.txt|What did we learn?
p314_079.txt|I go home only once.
p314_080.txt|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_081.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p314_082.txt|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p314_083.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p314_084.txt|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p314_085.txt|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p314_086.txt|The team this year is going places.
p314_087.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p314_088.txt|We should do everything at a stroke.
p314_089.txt|He had a moustache.
p314_090.txt|He has changed my life for ever.
p314_091.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p314_092.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p314_093.txt|Action must be taken urgently.
p314_094.txt|They are completely different from each other.
p314_095.txt|The money is not really our concern.
p314_096.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p314_097.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p314_098.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p314_099.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p314_100.txt|His team management was protective.
p314_101.txt|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314_102.txt|The proposal was rejected.
p314_103.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p314_104.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p314_105.txt|That would be even more disastrous.
p314_106.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p314_107.txt|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p314_108.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p314_109.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p314_110.txt|There are nine people here now.
p314_111.txt|Is my wife a racist?
p314_112.txt|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p314_113.txt|This would not be my first choice.
p314_114.txt|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p314_115.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p314_116.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p314_117.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p314_118.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p314_119.txt|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p314_120.txt|That's not fair to the supporters.
p314_121.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p314_122.txt|But the killer remains at large.
p314_123.txt|It is a great shame.
p314_124.txt|There are a lot of examples.
p314_125.txt|But it will backfire.
p314_126.txt|But then he changed his mind.
p314_127.txt|I really hope he thinks that through.
p314_128.txt|Police were also perplexed.
p314_129.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p314_130.txt|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p314_131.txt|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p314_132.txt|That's a huge amount.
p314_133.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p314_134.txt|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314_135.txt|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p314_136.txt|Folk music is in her blood.
p314_137.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p314_138.txt|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p314_139.txt|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p314_140.txt|I would love it.
p314_141.txt|This is the high point of my career.
p314_142.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p314_143.txt|My duty is to win.
p314_144.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p314_145.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p314_146.txt|Now we look forward to it.
p314_147.txt|There is no such thing.
p314_148.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p314_149.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p314_150.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p314_151.txt|Don't even bother applying.
p314_152.txt|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p314_153.txt|We like being the underdogs.
p314_154.txt|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p314_155.txt|But we are not immune to the problem.
p314_156.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p314_157.txt|It's all too short term.
p314_158.txt|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314_159.txt|We must move on.
p314_160.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p314_161.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p314_162.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p314_163.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p314_164.txt|The elections should have no role in this.
p314_165.txt|I should not be able to stand.
p314_166.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p314_167.txt|Little Voice is on general release.
p314_168.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p314_169.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p314_170.txt|They've got to get better.
p314_171.txt|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p314_172.txt|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p314_173.txt|We've got the top three.
p314_174.txt|I was never alone with her, right?
p314_175.txt|There is no substitute.
p314_176.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p314_177.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p314_178.txt|It's just a normal life.
p314_179.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p314_180.txt|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p314_181.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p314_182.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p314_183.txt|He is the example for all of us.
p314_184.txt|There is no way to do this.
p314_185.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p314_186.txt|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314_187.txt|I certainly do not agree with that.
p314_188.txt|It was a disaster of a race.
p314_189.txt|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314_190.txt|No, it's never been mentioned.
p314_191.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p314_192.txt|O Neill has delivered.
p314_193.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p314_194.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p314_195.txt|Our customers come first.
p314_196.txt|We will reform the welfare state.
p314_197.txt|It may be his last for a while, too.
p314_198.txt|His director of football is leaving.
p314_199.txt|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314_200.txt|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p314_201.txt|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p314_202.txt|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p314_203.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p314_204.txt|Drugs are getting through.
p314_205.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p314_206.txt|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314_207.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p314_208.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p314_209.txt|You saw the football.
p314_210.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p314_211.txt|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p314_212.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p314_213.txt|I am a little bit tired.
p314_214.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p314_215.txt|We have an attorney on the ground.
p314_216.txt|I looked forward to it.
p314_217.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p314_218.txt|I'd come back from London.
p314_219.txt|That it is a brand name.
p314_220.txt|She was an only child.
p314_221.txt|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p314_222.txt|They should come forward.
p314_223.txt|We don't say there was a massacre.
p314_224.txt|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p314_225.txt|The island will never recover.
p314_226.txt|That is not an easy thing.
p314_227.txt|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p314_228.txt|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p314_229.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p314_230.txt|It is a court case.
p314_231.txt|She was a delightful person.
p314_232.txt|The next one comes up.
p314_233.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p314_234.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p314_235.txt|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p314_236.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p314_237.txt|This is wonderful news.
p314_238.txt|Is he going to look after them?
p314_239.txt|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p314_240.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p314_241.txt|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p314_242.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p314_243.txt|I was just getting over the time difference.
p314_244.txt|I don't have any answer for them.
p314_245.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p314_246.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p314_247.txt|The death toll included five children.
p314_248.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p314_249.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p314_250.txt|And what is she escaping from?
p314_251.txt|You cannot allow it to go on.
p314_252.txt|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
p314_253.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p314_254.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p314_255.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p314_256.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p314_257.txt|That will not change.
p314_258.txt|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p314_259.txt|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p314_260.txt|I am deeply sorry they did.
p314_261.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p314_262.txt|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p314_263.txt|Who would have thought it?
p314_264.txt|He is young but not too young.
p314_265.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p314_266.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p314_267.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p314_268.txt|I took a minibus into town.
p314_269.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p314_270.txt|I'm not talking about his career.
p314_271.txt|I watched a game.
p314_272.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p314_273.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p314_274.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p314_275.txt|He has lost confidence and weight.
p314_276.txt|Intensive care has been very busy.
p314_277.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p314_278.txt|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314_279.txt|It could be a danger.
p314_280.txt|This is my home town.
p314_281.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p314_282.txt|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p314_283.txt|Nothing can bring back their son.
p314_284.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p314_285.txt|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p314_286.txt|Some may end up in hospital.
p314_287.txt|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p314_288.txt|The alliance said it may not wait.
p314_289.txt|I'm not putting myself down.
p314_290.txt|That is highly unfair.
p314_291.txt|There is great demand for human cloning.
p314_292.txt|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p314_293.txt|I am just trying to do my job.
p314_294.txt|I don't think we could have expected better.
p314_295.txt|You take a risk.
p314_296.txt|What are you going to do exactly?
p314_297.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p314_298.txt|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p314_299.txt|I just want to change my life.
p314_300.txt|A statement is expected in April.
p314_301.txt|Check that he is dead.
p314_302.txt|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p314_303.txt|He is also a great finisher.
p314_304.txt|This club have been fair to me.
p314_305.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p314_306.txt|This is too much like Scotland.
p314_307.txt|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p314_308.txt|A counter reaction was.
p314_309.txt|He said he was sorry.
p314_310.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p314_311.txt|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
p314_312.txt|That only came out during a radio interview.
p314_313.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p314_314.txt|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p314_315.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p314_316.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p314_317.txt|Neither was involved in violence.
p314_318.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p314_319.txt|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p314_320.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p314_321.txt|Hitches can be expected.
p314_322.txt|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p314_323.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p314_324.txt|I'll tell you honestly.
p314_325.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p314_326.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p314_327.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p314_328.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p314_329.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p314_330.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p314_331.txt|You have to think not.
p314_332.txt|No, no, it's not what you think.
p314_333.txt|This is a national crisis.
p314_334.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p314_335.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p314_336.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p314_337.txt|The whole thing would be perfect.
p314_338.txt|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p314_339.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p314_340.txt|However, we had no failures on our side.
p314_341.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p314_342.txt|His job was not advertised.
p314_343.txt|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p314_344.txt|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p314_345.txt|With us, we just want them to respond.
p314_346.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p314_347.txt|They are the heroes.
p314_348.txt|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p314_349.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p314_350.txt|This seems like a very good idea.
p314_351.txt|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p314_352.txt|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p314_353.txt|It took more than two years.
p314_354.txt|There is access for disabled people.
p314_355.txt|The home was now under new management.
p314_356.txt|We don't want to push him.
p314_357.txt|I like what has happened!
p314_358.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p314_359.txt|One was a lawyer.
p314_360.txt|There is no openness.
p314_361.txt|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p314_362.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p314_363.txt|It was a job he loved.
p314_364.txt|Now it has become a big picture.
p314_365.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p314_366.txt|But let's not get carried away.
p314_367.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p314_368.txt|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p314_369.txt|It looks like paradise.
p314_370.txt|This means a great deal to the families.
p314_371.txt|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p314_372.txt|We were short of athletes.
p314_373.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314_374.txt|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p314_375.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p314_376.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p314_377.txt|Only local people are helping.
p314_378.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p314_379.txt|There were three boys and two girls.
p314_380.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p314_381.txt|He had no answer.
p314_382.txt|There is a job to be done.
p314_383.txt|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p314_384.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p314_385.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p314_386.txt|I can't believe what has happened.
p314_387.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p314_388.txt|You do that because you want to win.
p314_389.txt|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p314_390.txt|It was early morning.
p314_391.txt|Partition is not an option.
p314_392.txt|We've been treated with complete contempt.
p314_393.txt|There must be boundaries.
p314_394.txt|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p314_395.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p314_396.txt|We can make changes.
p314_397.txt|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p314_398.txt|The conclusion is enthralling.
p314_399.txt|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p314_400.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p314_401.txt|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p314_402.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p314_403.txt|Friends of the family have given their support.
p314_404.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p314_405.txt|You name it, they have it.
p314_406.txt|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p314_407.txt|The review has been conducted fairly.
p314_408.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p314_409.txt|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p314_410.txt|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
p314_411.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p314_412.txt|It is a natural reaction.
p314_413.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p314_414.txt|I don't believe that money is the answer.
p314_415.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p314_416.txt|I am in a very difficult position.
p314_417.txt|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p314_418.txt|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p314_419.txt|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p314_420.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p314_421.txt|He is not very big, either.
p314_422.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p314_423.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p316_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p316_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p316_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p316_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316_009.txt|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p316_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316_025.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p316_026.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p316_027.txt|Have we tried everything?
p316_028.txt|It's not going to work out that way.
p316_029.txt|We have worked hard.
p316_030.txt|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p316_031.txt|Naturally, she said yes.
p316_032.txt|This is not a war on terror.
p316_033.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p316_034.txt|There will always be problems on the way.
p316_035.txt|Why you did it will never be known.
p316_036.txt|He was in his element.
p316_037.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316_038.txt|What a week he has had.
p316_039.txt|We just want this season to end.
p316_040.txt|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_041.txt|There is a new confidence about the club.
p316_042.txt|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316_043.txt|We accept the challenge.
p316_044.txt|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316_045.txt|After that it is up to the boss.
p316_046.txt|They were taken to prove a point.
p316_047.txt|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316_048.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p316_049.txt|So, why does he do it?
p316_050.txt|I would love to have him home.
p316_051.txt|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316_052.txt|He had no enemies.
p316_053.txt|That is not the case this time.
p316_054.txt|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316_055.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p316_056.txt|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057.txt|There was only silence.
p316_058.txt|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_059.txt|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060.txt|However, our players will fight for that.
p316_061.txt|Everyone was very saddened.
p316_062.txt|He declined to give further details.
p316_063.txt|He said it was for sale.
p316_064.txt|This is a dream come true.
p316_065.txt|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316_066.txt|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067.txt|What on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068.txt|This is far too high.
p316_069.txt|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070.txt|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316_071.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072.txt|It has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073.txt|He was also a great man.
p316_074.txt|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075.txt|It is clear that change is required.
p316_076.txt|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316_077.txt|This is a big step up.
p316_078.txt|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_079.txt|The judge was very nice.
p316_080.txt|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082.txt|Most of them have already gone home.
p316_083.txt|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p316_084.txt|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316_085.txt|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p316_086.txt|Can you imagine a world without design?
p316_087.txt|He was caught and fired.
p316_088.txt|I feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089.txt|The driver escaped injury.
p316_090.txt|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_091.txt|There was no bad behaviour.
p316_092.txt|Today she has been released.
p316_093.txt|It's a much bigger problem.
p316_094.txt|There are no problems between us at all.
p316_095.txt|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316_096.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p316_097.txt|I hope it comes out all right.
p316_098.txt|I will just have to be patient.
p316_099.txt|It's a sensible management decision.
p316_100.txt|I kept it very simple.
p316_101.txt|The rest was badminton.
p316_102.txt|It will take several days.
p316_103.txt|We had to push to get a goal.
p316_104.txt|That got me out.
p316_105.txt|I would just like someone to confess.
p316_106.txt|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_107.txt|It will have to ratify the deal.
p316_108.txt|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_109.txt|I was not a joiner.
p316_110.txt|It has to find out what went wrong.
p316_111.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p316_112.txt|It has until Saturday.
p316_113.txt|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_114.txt|She has the biggest part.
p316_115.txt|We will win this tie.
p316_116.txt|This is totally untrue.
p316_117.txt|Or someone wants to say something different.
p316_118.txt|I think they have to change that.
p316_119.txt|This series is for real.
p316_120.txt|It's great news, isn't it.
p316_121.txt|It's very ingenious.
p316_122.txt|That would depend on the parole board.
p316_123.txt|It is all up to the Members.
p316_124.txt|The two sets are different.
p316_125.txt|And now the pressure is off.
p316_126.txt|You can see the appeal of running away.
p316_127.txt|Their opening was disastrous.
p316_128.txt|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316_129.txt|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_130.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p316_131.txt|Too much has already been said.
p316_132.txt|Now, however, things are different.
p316_133.txt|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p316_134.txt|She is not the world champion.
p316_135.txt|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_136.txt|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p316_137.txt|He is a bully.
p316_138.txt|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_139.txt|I've won the British.
p316_140.txt|And so the cycle continues.
p316_141.txt|I don't have many friends.
p316_142.txt|However, it was a different story in the final.
p316_143.txt|They exist in name alone.
p316_144.txt|I am not retiring.
p316_145.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p316_146.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p316_147.txt|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316_148.txt|Feel for five seconds.
p316_149.txt|I hope it is a good omen.
p316_150.txt|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316_151.txt|They will appear again next week.
p316_152.txt|Failure is not an option.
p316_153.txt|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_154.txt|You look at that.
p316_155.txt|Things begin to spring to life.
p316_156.txt|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316_157.txt|I understood that concern.
p316_158.txt|The things writers and directors say!
p316_159.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p316_160.txt|It was like a dream to be here.
p316_161.txt|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_162.txt|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316_163.txt|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_164.txt|We did not deserve to go through.
p316_165.txt|It's got to be in the head.
p316_166.txt|It certainly sounded it at times.
p316_167.txt|It will be too hot.
p316_168.txt|That happens in boxing.
p316_169.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p316_170.txt|None of the opinions is good.
p316_171.txt|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_172.txt|They must not succeed.
p316_173.txt|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_174.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p316_175.txt|I have never seen him like that.
p316_176.txt|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_177.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316_178.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316_179.txt|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316_180.txt|We played better after the break.
p316_181.txt|But this relative success has not been easy.
p316_182.txt|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_183.txt|Of course it is still possible.
p316_184.txt|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p316_185.txt|That, in a way, is the point.
p316_186.txt|What is so unusual about this case?
p316_187.txt|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p316_188.txt|That would end it for us.
p316_189.txt|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_190.txt|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p316_191.txt|I just love lessons.
p316_192.txt|Retirement is on his mind.
p316_193.txt|It's to do with this place.
p316_194.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_195.txt|We shall not be moved.
p316_196.txt|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316_197.txt|It is not just the agencies.
p316_198.txt|There must be boundaries.
p316_199.txt|However, he was later released without charge.
p316_200.txt|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_201.txt|I watch the other visitors.
p316_202.txt|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_204.txt|He confirmed his fitness.
p316_205.txt|The gap is narrowing.
p316_206.txt|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_207.txt|Both men were uninjured.
p316_208.txt|My husband was fighting for his life.
p316_209.txt|It is not a financial issue.
p316_210.txt|We are in this for the long haul.
p316_211.txt|We have a budget in March.
p316_212.txt|There was no respite.
p316_213.txt|I got very, very tired.
p316_214.txt|I am really sorry that he is going.
p316_215.txt|They will do their own thing.
p316_216.txt|It is too much for me.
p316_217.txt|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_218.txt|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_219.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p316_220.txt|We need a much wider debate.
p316_221.txt|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_222.txt|Look at a computer.
p316_223.txt|They went back to the seventeenth.
p316_224.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p316_225.txt|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_226.txt|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316_227.txt|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p316_228.txt|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316_229.txt|I waited and waited.
p316_230.txt|We all knew it could not be true.
p316_231.txt|Its future is uncertain.
p316_232.txt|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_233.txt|It doesn't look good for her.
p316_234.txt|She said he did not look too happy.
p316_235.txt|We are aware of the problem.
p316_236.txt|Where will the elderly go then?
p316_237.txt|Then it was changed without notice.
p316_238.txt|He had a great game.
p316_239.txt|The following year, they asked him again.
p316_240.txt|It is the men who create the demand.
p316_241.txt|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_242.txt|Every case is completely different.
p316_243.txt|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316_244.txt|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_245.txt|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p316_246.txt|It will be fine.
p316_247.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p316_248.txt|They are you, the fans.
p316_249.txt|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_250.txt|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p316_251.txt|What a difference a game can make.
p316_252.txt|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316_253.txt|Why do it?
p316_254.txt|It opened last month.
p316_255.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p316_256.txt|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p316_257.txt|I have totally had enough.
p316_258.txt|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_259.txt|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_260.txt|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p316_261.txt|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_262.txt|What are you waiting for?
p316_263.txt|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316_264.txt|This is still happening in the US.
p316_265.txt|Another issue will be policing.
p316_266.txt|Today was first class.
p316_267.txt|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_268.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p316_269.txt|This is a good move for me.
p316_270.txt|Feel the heat?
p316_271.txt|She was so full of life.
p316_272.txt|I should have given him one in return.
p316_273.txt|I began to pray.
p316_274.txt|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_275.txt|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_276.txt|I just wanted to fly.
p316_277.txt|And he has a tale to tell.
p316_278.txt|Footballers have also been targeted.
p316_279.txt|The deadline is real and absolute.
p316_280.txt|So, how did this happen?
p316_281.txt|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_282.txt|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_283.txt|There are no quick fixes.
p316_284.txt|The change was not instant.
p316_285.txt|We've got the bronze.
p316_286.txt|They use them for everything.
p316_287.txt|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_288.txt|We are not defeated.
p316_289.txt|He knows what he's got to do.
p316_290.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p316_291.txt|We have been going for three years.
p316_292.txt|We deserved the three points.
p316_293.txt|It is planned for London in the spring.
p316_294.txt|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_295.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p316_296.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_297.txt|Which brings us to the point.
p316_298.txt|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_299.txt|I am quite excited about it.
p316_300.txt|Everyone agrees with that.
p316_301.txt|She had denied the charge.
p316_302.txt|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p316_303.txt|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_304.txt|I didn't feel good.
p316_305.txt|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_306.txt|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_307.txt|Let's get to know him.
p316_308.txt|We have got to attack.
p316_309.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p316_310.txt|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_311.txt|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_312.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p316_313.txt|How would it work?
p316_314.txt|We told them in July.
p316_315.txt|The film was great.
p316_316.txt|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_317.txt|It's a real challenge.
p316_318.txt|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_319.txt|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316_320.txt|There was too much at stake.
p316_321.txt|I read about it in the newspapers.
p316_322.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p316_323.txt|Is that not uncanny?
p316_324.txt|It has to reinvent itself.
p316_325.txt|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316_326.txt|He was happy with his form.
p316_327.txt|His art was not just about emotions.
p316_328.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p316_329.txt|It's a production company.
p316_330.txt|But we will not be scared.
p316_331.txt|But that is not an issue for now.
p316_332.txt|It will not work in our favour.
p316_333.txt|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316_334.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p316_335.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p316_336.txt|There will be no receivers.
p316_337.txt|My son was too young to die.
p316_338.txt|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_339.txt|It's a national sport.
p316_340.txt|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316_341.txt|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316_342.txt|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_343.txt|I was shocked and outraged.
p316_344.txt|Not many people like to do that.
p316_345.txt|It was extremely cold.
p316_346.txt|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_347.txt|People are using it in their daily lives.
p316_348.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p316_349.txt|We have to open up.
p316_350.txt|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_351.txt|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_352.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p316_353.txt|It was just awful.
p316_354.txt|We are doing okay in the league.
p316_355.txt|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_356.txt|It is time for concerted national action.
p316_357.txt|Do you know who we are?
p316_358.txt|Souter will be back.
p316_359.txt|I'd like to report a murder.
p316_360.txt|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_361.txt|It certainly gives you hope.
p316_362.txt|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p316_363.txt|Two people have died.
p316_364.txt|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_365.txt|I am delighted to have her back home.
p316_366.txt|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_367.txt|It is based on his movement records.
p316_368.txt|It wasn't an easy decision.
p316_369.txt|It left me with sadness.
p316_370.txt|There is a changing of the guard.
p316_371.txt|The boys are very confident.
p316_372.txt|It was our time maybe.
p316_373.txt|I know we can play a lot better.
p316_374.txt|We said it will happen one night.
p316_375.txt|It is a flexible concept.
p316_376.txt|This election is far from over.
p316_377.txt|So the Government will be damaged.
p316_378.txt|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316_379.txt|However, we let them back into the game.
p316_380.txt|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316_381.txt|Is that such a bad thing?
p316_382.txt|You do need a check and a balance.
p316_383.txt|Thousands of people were missing.
p316_384.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_385.txt|It's time to move on.
p316_386.txt|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_387.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316_388.txt|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p316_389.txt|I can't describe it.
p316_390.txt|It changed my life.
p316_391.txt|But what will we put on it?
p316_392.txt|It will benefit a lot of people.
p316_393.txt|A new school will be built.
p316_394.txt|There may be hope this year, however.
p316_395.txt|That is not too bad.
p316_396.txt|They are taking a stand against this.
p316_397.txt|They are not left wing.
p316_398.txt|I was the sheep.
p316_399.txt|I think we believed the tie was won.
p316_400.txt|Well, there you go.
p316_401.txt|How do you find the youngsters?
p316_402.txt|It was a great team effort.
p316_403.txt|In my experience, he does not do that.
p316_404.txt|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316_405.txt|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_406.txt|Its first awards will just do that.
p316_407.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_408.txt|That is my preference.
p316_409.txt|Taxation should be simplified.
p316_410.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_411.txt|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_412.txt|I have signed a contract.
p316_413.txt|I have never been overly ambitious.
p316_414.txt|We were beaten by the better team.
p316_415.txt|I hope you don't regret it.
p316_416.txt|He was all blackened.
p316_417.txt|This is your country.
p316_418.txt|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_419.txt|Audiences there were shocked.
p316_420.txt|They responded in the most positive way.
p316_421.txt|The British government said she was coming home.
p316_422.txt|We won very easily.
p316_423.txt|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p317_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p317_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p317_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p317_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p317_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p317_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p317_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p317_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p317_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p317_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p317_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p317_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p317_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p317_025.txt|They have the cash to do that.
p317_026.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p317_027.txt|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p317_028.txt|It is so elusive and light.
p317_029.txt|I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_030.txt|The council has been open and transparent.
p317_031.txt|Is the war over?
p317_032.txt|The country is in a state of chaos.
p317_033.txt|But don't expect an easy ride.
p317_034.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p317_035.txt|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p317_036.txt|It was a policy they were against.
p317_037.txt|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_038.txt|We see little sign of improvement.
p317_039.txt|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p317_040.txt|The gaffer was great.
p317_041.txt|Overall, however, these were also down.
p317_042.txt|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p317_043.txt|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_044.txt|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_045.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p317_046.txt|I would think they are just behind them.
p317_047.txt|We then went to see the headmaster.
p317_048.txt|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p317_049.txt|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_050.txt|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_051.txt|These men are a part of India.
p317_052.txt|Are we going to stay up?
p317_053.txt|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p317_054.txt|I am going home to see my children.
p317_055.txt|New potential dangers were emerging.
p317_056.txt|That tells you something about them.
p317_057.txt|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p317_058.txt|I am a drug addict.
p317_059.txt|I've had to take time off work today.
p317_060.txt|The problem is the book.
p317_061.txt|There was no basis for their arrest.
p317_062.txt|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p317_063.txt|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317_064.txt|They say he wants to go to England.
p317_065.txt|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317_066.txt|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317_067.txt|Wagner was never like this.
p317_068.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p317_069.txt|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p317_070.txt|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
p317_071.txt|I've come here for the jersey.
p317_072.txt|This is not an optional extra.
p317_073.txt|This is not the most crucial issue.
p317_074.txt|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
p317_075.txt|It's that sort of night.
p317_076.txt|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p317_077.txt|Will we ever play together again?
p317_078.txt|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p317_079.txt|I played well but missed a few chances.
p317_080.txt|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p317_081.txt|I'm so proud of my team.
p317_082.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_083.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p317_084.txt|This has not, and has been neglected.
p317_085.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p317_086.txt|What did you learn in school today?
p317_087.txt|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p317_088.txt|We will see how he is after treatment.
p317_089.txt|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317_090.txt|There is no signature on this document.
p317_091.txt|We could not compete with Rangers.
p317_092.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p317_093.txt|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p317_094.txt|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317_095.txt|However, it is much bigger than that.
p317_096.txt|One season, they might do well.
p317_097.txt|Our approach will be different.
p317_098.txt|Too much has already been said.
p317_099.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317_100.txt|But don't worry just yet.
p317_101.txt|This championship is different from the other majors.
p317_102.txt|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p317_103.txt|I drove the ball well.
p317_104.txt|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p317_105.txt|His handling raises a wider issue.
p317_106.txt|We have got the school holidays on.
p317_107.txt|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p317_108.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p317_109.txt|We understand the changes in the world.
p317_110.txt|It is a potential factor.
p317_111.txt|This is the big one.
p317_112.txt|That just wasn't good enough.
p317_113.txt|The company has other problems with the shells.
p317_114.txt|The working families tax credit is far better.
p317_115.txt|He had done his homework properly.
p317_116.txt|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p317_117.txt|We must get the three points.
p317_118.txt|Players were held in equally low regard.
p317_119.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p317_120.txt|It's to do with context.
p317_121.txt|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p317_122.txt|Our home is your home.
p317_123.txt|It is essential that we win the game.
p317_124.txt|There was no confusion over the second.
p317_125.txt|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p317_126.txt|A decision is expected shortly.
p317_127.txt|Hear what they have to say.
p317_128.txt|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p317_129.txt|You would be wrong.
p317_130.txt|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p317_131.txt|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317_132.txt|I think it is wide open.
p317_133.txt|They too refused to come out and talk.
p317_134.txt|We took the chances when they came.
p317_135.txt|It is important that vital services are maintained.
p317_136.txt|These services may also have to be cut.
p317_137.txt|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p317_138.txt|The captaincy will help that, too.
p317_139.txt|We can't have it both ways.
p317_140.txt|Actors stand still in the frame.
p317_141.txt|Who honestly expected anything else?
p317_142.txt|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p317_143.txt|MOVIE stars are public property.
p317_144.txt|They never looked like winning it either.
p317_145.txt|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
p317_146.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p317_147.txt|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p317_148.txt|It was a wilful act of violence.
p317_149.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p317_150.txt|We never got off the bus.
p317_151.txt|The driver escaped injury.
p317_152.txt|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p317_153.txt|They should be looking at his victims.
p317_154.txt|We told them in June.
p317_155.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p317_156.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p317_157.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p317_158.txt|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p317_159.txt|She is a double victim.
p317_160.txt|How can you not react?
p317_161.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p317_162.txt|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p317_163.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p317_164.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317_165.txt|There was an e-mail.
p317_166.txt|That is a lot of writing.
p317_167.txt|I try to be open to experience.
p317_168.txt|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317_169.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p317_170.txt|It is no place for a poet.
p317_171.txt|This is excellent value for money.
p317_172.txt|Each day is a new beginning.
p317_173.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p317_174.txt|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p317_175.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p317_176.txt|Thereafter he left Scotland.
p317_177.txt|We've come from a long way back.
p317_178.txt|A lot of things can go wrong.
p317_179.txt|I was delighted with Robbie.
p317_180.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p317_181.txt|I'll just do my best.
p317_182.txt|Three penalties were given.
p317_183.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p317_184.txt|The police were called in.
p317_185.txt|The group would never be the same again.
p317_186.txt|Aye, but who do you really support?
p317_187.txt|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p317_188.txt|This is not a birthday party.
p317_189.txt|This makes no sense!
p317_190.txt|It's a drop in the bucket.
p317_191.txt|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p317_192.txt|He said that this is beautiful.
p317_193.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p317_194.txt|That option cannot be ruled out.
p317_195.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p317_196.txt|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p317_197.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p317_198.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p317_199.txt|That's how she wants to remember him.
p317_200.txt|How do you respond to losing your child?
p317_201.txt|Who is the employer?
p317_202.txt|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p317_203.txt|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p317_204.txt|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p317_205.txt|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p317_206.txt|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p317_207.txt|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p317_208.txt|Would he be able to live with that?
p317_209.txt|However, what is his calibre?
p317_210.txt|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p317_211.txt|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p317_212.txt|It's a production company.
p317_213.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p317_214.txt|She died in middle age.
p317_215.txt|They do the work, you know.
p317_216.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p317_217.txt|We are in the hat.
p317_218.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p317_219.txt|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p317_220.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p317_221.txt|Other people also tried.
p317_222.txt|But Harry has become a franchise.
p317_223.txt|He is at war with his knee.
p317_224.txt|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p317_225.txt|I can't deny that fact.
p317_226.txt|Clubs can only do so much.
p317_227.txt|It's unsafe for society.
p317_228.txt|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317_229.txt|It would have very little impact on them.
p317_230.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p317_231.txt|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p317_232.txt|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_233.txt|I don't care to recall it.
p317_234.txt|That's the whole idea.
p317_235.txt|They showed a lot of heart.
p317_236.txt|Michael, he is running!
p317_237.txt|My life is a mess.
p317_238.txt|He did not report it.
p317_239.txt|You must be ready to play anyone.
p317_240.txt|For example they could be in school uniform.
p317_241.txt|Surely the panel was interested?
p317_242.txt|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_243.txt|It's like English in its underwear.
p317_244.txt|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317_245.txt|I now know that from memory.
p317_246.txt|We need to tighten up.
p317_247.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p317_248.txt|This is a huge event.
p317_249.txt|Just get on with your job.
p317_250.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p317_251.txt|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p317_252.txt|You are not going in blind.
p317_253.txt|They just made me feel dizzy.
p317_254.txt|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p317_255.txt|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p317_256.txt|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p317_257.txt|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p317_258.txt|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p317_259.txt|We have great confidence in Derek.
p317_260.txt|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p317_261.txt|We are not too surprised.
p317_262.txt|There were no new cases yesterday.
p317_263.txt|If only the problems concerned the players.
p317_264.txt|It will be an eye for an eye.
p317_265.txt|Whatever happened to that one?
p317_266.txt|There were no proposals on the table.
p317_267.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p317_268.txt|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p317_269.txt|Do you want a cup of tea.
p317_270.txt|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p317_271.txt|We have all been shocked by her death.
p317_272.txt|We are asking the council to think again.
p317_273.txt|We are committed to urgent action.
p317_274.txt|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p317_275.txt|I am totally surprised.
p317_276.txt|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p317_277.txt|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p317_278.txt|The bookies have got it about right.
p317_279.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p317_280.txt|It was always open for extension.
p317_281.txt|I think we're very different.
p317_282.txt|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p317_283.txt|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317_284.txt|And that is not a bad idea.
p317_285.txt|He also has a house in Italy.
p317_286.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p317_287.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p317_288.txt|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p317_289.txt|It's so creative and different.
p317_290.txt|They are in care for a reason.
p317_291.txt|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_292.txt|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p317_293.txt|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p317_294.txt|It got no better.
p317_295.txt|I keep my fingers crossed.
p317_296.txt|Some were close to tears.
p317_297.txt|It would then be up to the judge.
p317_298.txt|Was all this really just five months ago?
p317_299.txt|Some reports said they had been killed.
p317_300.txt|This is the start of a new campaign.
p317_301.txt|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p317_302.txt|The failings are serious.
p317_303.txt|It is like a bereavement.
p317_304.txt|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317_305.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p317_306.txt|I got on very well with Allan.
p317_307.txt|That has given me great confidence.
p317_308.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p317_309.txt|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p317_310.txt|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p317_311.txt|He was lying face down in the water.
p317_312.txt|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p317_313.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p317_314.txt|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p317_315.txt|They didn't have a care in the world.
p317_316.txt|I was in the zone in the morning.
p317_317.txt|He urged people to forgive.
p317_318.txt|In fact, it might just be beginning.
p317_319.txt|So he is open to ideas.
p317_320.txt|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p317_321.txt|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p317_322.txt|There is no right to appeal.
p317_323.txt|We are expected to do better than before.
p317_324.txt|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p317_325.txt|I am not even thinking about that.
p317_326.txt|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
p317_327.txt|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317_328.txt|It is good for their eyesight.
p317_329.txt|I feel it is very irrational.
p317_330.txt|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p317_331.txt|It is still with Ministers.
p317_332.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p317_333.txt|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_334.txt|We are not doing the Today programme.
p317_335.txt|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
p317_336.txt|She was charged with perjury.
p317_337.txt|I was not a joiner.
p317_338.txt|The sleeper was six hours late.
p317_339.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p317_340.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p317_341.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p317_342.txt|They were average apart, together superb.
p317_343.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p317_344.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p317_345.txt|That never seemed likely.
p317_346.txt|A decision is expected next March.
p317_347.txt|We don't believe anything anymore.
p317_348.txt|I am awaiting a reply.
p317_349.txt|There was no need for such a hostel.
p317_350.txt|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317_351.txt|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p317_352.txt|There's no doubt about it.
p317_353.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p317_354.txt|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p317_355.txt|What's a boy to do?
p317_356.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p317_357.txt|The other was the tabloids.
p317_358.txt|They should be swept away.
p317_359.txt|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p317_360.txt|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317_361.txt|We want to replicate that success.
p317_362.txt|We were lucky to have survived.
p317_363.txt|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p317_364.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p317_365.txt|He would help me with the form.
p317_366.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p317_367.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p317_368.txt|And he goes with it.
p317_369.txt|The actors just have to say so.
p317_370.txt|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317_371.txt|I am so lucky for that.
p317_372.txt|It broke up my marriage.
p317_373.txt|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p317_374.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p317_375.txt|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p317_376.txt|I think it was briefly considered.
p317_377.txt|And Rangers think they have problems.
p317_378.txt|We talk to each other about these matters.
p317_379.txt|It's a hidden problem.
p317_380.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p317_381.txt|There will be two other areas of contention.
p317_382.txt|I lost a part of me.
p317_383.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p317_384.txt|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p317_385.txt|But he has strong links to Labour.
p317_386.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p317_387.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p317_388.txt|And he is immensely loyal.
p317_389.txt|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p317_390.txt|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317_391.txt|This looks like it is anything but open.
p317_392.txt|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317_393.txt|She kept him on a string.
p317_394.txt|The committees are due to report next year.
p317_395.txt|It's a long-term solution.
p317_396.txt|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p317_397.txt|What's the theme?
p317_398.txt|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p317_399.txt|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p317_400.txt|It's a very special unit.
p317_401.txt|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317_402.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p317_403.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p317_404.txt|It's only tackling congestion.
p317_405.txt|And our game is about going forward.
p317_406.txt|They will have to cut through the roof.
p317_407.txt|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p317_408.txt|That's the law of the land.
p317_409.txt|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p317_410.txt|What's wrong with that?
p317_411.txt|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p317_412.txt|Then one night only three people turn up.
p317_413.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p317_414.txt|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p317_415.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p317_416.txt|This was not the show for me.
p317_417.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p317_418.txt|She was extremely rigid.
p317_419.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p317_420.txt|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p317_421.txt|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p317_422.txt|Appointments should be made on merit.
p317_423.txt|Manchester United are the classic example.
p318_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p318_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p318_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p318_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p318_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p318_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p318_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p318_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p318_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p318_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p318_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p318_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p318_025.txt|They will be dealt with.
p318_026.txt|It is never an easy game.
p318_027.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p318_028.txt|I intend to raise the matter there.
p318_029.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p318_030.txt|We have to put this behind us.
p318_031.txt|I thought it was quite good.
p318_032.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p318_033.txt|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p318_034.txt|That is impressive by any standards.
p318_035.txt|We are doing very well as we are.
p318_036.txt|The waiting is over, well almost.
p318_037.txt|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p318_038.txt|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p318_039.txt|It helped to get me noticed.
p318_040.txt|They hit me in the head.
p318_041.txt|But he is not using them.
p318_042.txt|That, though, was just the start of it.
p318_043.txt|We are not moving in.
p318_044.txt|We have not had a formal request.
p318_045.txt|I never had a childhood.
p318_046.txt|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_047.txt|We offered something different.
p318_048.txt|We were very much a happy family.
p318_049.txt|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_050.txt|My brother is buried under there.
p318_051.txt|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_052.txt|What were they?
p318_053.txt|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_054.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p318_055.txt|Her role in it was small.
p318_056.txt|I have really noticed that this week.
p318_057.txt|We might be back next year.
p318_058.txt|In a way he was.
p318_059.txt|It's back to how it used to be.
p318_060.txt|It is not a standing army.
p318_061.txt|The firm was down and almost out.
p318_062.txt|They said they were only young men.
p318_063.txt|I was chosen to do this.
p318_064.txt|I learned a lot from that.
p318_065.txt|The house was so well alight.
p318_066.txt|He got his degree.
p318_067.txt|Sandy was very active.
p318_068.txt|However, there is great potential in this right.
p318_069.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_070.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_071.txt|There were no formal announcements.
p318_072.txt|Before the games it was pretty open.
p318_073.txt|It really has left the town in shock.
p318_074.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p318_075.txt|I'm so worried about the roads.
p318_076.txt|This was much worse.
p318_077.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p318_078.txt|We are confident of taking that back.
p318_079.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p318_080.txt|Did they give any good advice?
p318_081.txt|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_082.txt|This does not help.
p318_083.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p318_084.txt|That's why the ministers resigned.
p318_085.txt|He has lost confidence and weight.
p318_086.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318_087.txt|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318_088.txt|This could be her way forward.
p318_089.txt|This gives us a lot of practice.
p318_090.txt|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p318_091.txt|It's a very, very special day.
p318_092.txt|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p318_093.txt|There's also the point.
p318_094.txt|It was forced to divert.
p318_095.txt|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p318_096.txt|That's the National Grid.
p318_097.txt|But Allen is deadly serious.
p318_098.txt|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p318_099.txt|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318_100.txt|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p318_101.txt|This is my personal assessment.
p318_102.txt|There was no trouble at all.
p318_103.txt|Although, you never know.
p318_104.txt|We shall be victorious.
p318_105.txt|The quality of work is very impressive.
p318_106.txt|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p318_107.txt|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p318_108.txt|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p318_109.txt|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318_110.txt|I took the gun.
p318_111.txt|It's just one of those things.
p318_112.txt|A web site is planned for November.
p318_113.txt|We played so well at times.
p318_114.txt|I was very fortunate.
p318_115.txt|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p318_116.txt|We act because we must.
p318_117.txt|They will be destroyed.
p318_118.txt|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318_119.txt|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p318_120.txt|The Tory party will last.
p318_121.txt|It was a journey into a new life.
p318_122.txt|It's a way of making a mark.
p318_123.txt|There is a great carry over value.
p318_124.txt|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p318_125.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p318_126.txt|What's the point?
p318_127.txt|Why is this?
p318_128.txt|What has changed since then?
p318_129.txt|Raymond was always on the outside.
p318_130.txt|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p318_131.txt|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p318_132.txt|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318_133.txt|I am sorry to hear this news.
p318_134.txt|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p318_135.txt|I mean it happens.
p318_136.txt|This week is a perfect example.
p318_137.txt|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318_138.txt|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p318_139.txt|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p318_140.txt|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p318_141.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p318_142.txt|It is typical of me.
p318_143.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p318_144.txt|They played it like a cup final.
p318_145.txt|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p318_146.txt|But the championship is not over yet.
p318_147.txt|We haven't found out anything different.
p318_148.txt|A review of the decision is being sought.
p318_149.txt|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p318_150.txt|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p318_151.txt|Surely it can do better than that?
p318_152.txt|I am ashamed of them.
p318_153.txt|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p318_154.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p318_155.txt|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p318_156.txt|If so, we want to hear from them.
p318_157.txt|I am not blaming audiences.
p318_158.txt|Who was on the panel?
p318_159.txt|They may differ on other issues.
p318_160.txt|He had never run the distance before.
p318_161.txt|I can make one further announcement.
p318_162.txt|The General Election is all to play for.
p318_163.txt|It was a fiery game.
p318_164.txt|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p318_165.txt|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318_166.txt|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p318_167.txt|It will not be easy for him.
p318_168.txt|This one is a special case.
p318_169.txt|But what are the songs about?
p318_170.txt|There is a simmering anger out there.
p318_171.txt|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p318_172.txt|That is not a position they enjoy.
p318_173.txt|The stadium was full.
p318_174.txt|Dewar is the medium.
p318_175.txt|It was that kind of night.
p318_176.txt|It is very much a matter for them.
p318_177.txt|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p318_178.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p318_179.txt|He's got a great chance of making it.
p318_180.txt|We won't do that.
p318_181.txt|I hope we do.
p318_182.txt|From now on there is no hiding place.
p318_183.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318_184.txt|He quit in October.
p318_185.txt|The United Nations must act.
p318_186.txt|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p318_187.txt|Her daughter is getting married.
p318_188.txt|His manager blamed the referee.
p318_189.txt|They were that poor.
p318_190.txt|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p318_191.txt|We have understood the problems for some time.
p318_192.txt|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p318_193.txt|All these things have an impact.
p318_194.txt|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318_195.txt|They believed it worked.
p318_196.txt|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p318_197.txt|They should feel ashamed.
p318_198.txt|This is a really serious issue.
p318_199.txt|So they will settle again.
p318_200.txt|How do we get more people in?
p318_201.txt|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p318_202.txt|It looks as though there is no chance.
p318_203.txt|This is not a European Army.
p318_204.txt|Election results are expected soon.
p318_205.txt|So she told him.
p318_206.txt|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318_207.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p318_208.txt|It was good to score the goal today.
p318_209.txt|The night is young.
p318_210.txt|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p318_211.txt|I suspect that it will.
p318_212.txt|But there's no eye contact.
p318_213.txt|The squad will be the same for France.
p318_214.txt|We are a party for people, not against people.
p318_215.txt|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318_216.txt|We are still paying the price for that.
p318_217.txt|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p318_218.txt|It is not a wish list.
p318_219.txt|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p318_220.txt|Some of the players have not progressed.
p318_221.txt|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p318_222.txt|If not, he should go home.
p318_223.txt|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p318_224.txt|There is no margin for error.
p318_225.txt|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p318_226.txt|From our point of view, it is the right time.
p318_227.txt|That figure will always remain with me.
p318_228.txt|And then a funny thing happened.
p318_229.txt|It does not take much.
p318_230.txt|She asked us a lot of questions.
p318_231.txt|It was a stunning strike.
p318_232.txt|It is a technique.
p318_233.txt|They hold on for many years.
p318_234.txt|Is it the shape of things to come?
p318_235.txt|My body is exhausted.
p318_236.txt|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p318_237.txt|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p318_238.txt|There is nothing to fear.
p318_239.txt|I was an athlete.
p318_240.txt|Life was like a timetable.
p318_241.txt|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318_242.txt|I tried to push him away.
p318_243.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318_244.txt|This was done by the council staff.
p318_245.txt|The truth is otherwise.
p318_246.txt|We haven't come out of this very well.
p318_247.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p318_248.txt|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p318_249.txt|We should be rewarded for producing.
p318_250.txt|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p318_251.txt|Which, in effect, it is.
p318_252.txt|The man became a reporter.
p318_253.txt|It is a memorial.
p318_254.txt|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318_255.txt|Our people are paying high prices.
p318_256.txt|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p318_257.txt|Nor is it likely to do so.
p318_258.txt|Or so everyone believed.
p318_259.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p318_260.txt|I read it every year.
p318_261.txt|He was in contention almost every week.
p318_262.txt|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p318_263.txt|It is up to Ann.
p318_264.txt|We are playing them at their own game.
p318_265.txt|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318_266.txt|I had trouble with the producers.
p318_267.txt|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p318_268.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318_269.txt|The conference is the first test.
p318_270.txt|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p318_271.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p318_272.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p318_273.txt|There is no more money.
p318_274.txt|My mother is a widow.
p318_275.txt|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318_276.txt|There have been different reports from different people.
p318_277.txt|It's an absolute disgrace.
p318_278.txt|Something was plainly wrong.
p318_279.txt|Why should he go anywhere?
p318_280.txt|One thing is sure.
p318_281.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p318_282.txt|I'm confident we can do that.
p318_283.txt|Funding needs to be long term.
p318_284.txt|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p318_285.txt|I would never even consider it.
p318_286.txt|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p318_287.txt|The end result is precisely the same.
p318_288.txt|We have it on video.
p318_289.txt|I am not a threat to coaches.
p318_290.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p318_291.txt|It's never over until it's over.
p318_292.txt|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p318_293.txt|This year, it was a little different.
p318_294.txt|That, though, is to miss the point.
p318_295.txt|We gave them the goal.
p318_296.txt|Is being naturally funny enough?
p318_297.txt|What's the point of staying sober?
p318_298.txt|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p318_299.txt|The incident is being taken seriously.
p318_300.txt|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p318_301.txt|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p318_302.txt|I can feel the sound inside.
p318_303.txt|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318_304.txt|I am not a fan of books.
p318_305.txt|SO now we know the secret.
p318_306.txt|It may well have been.
p318_307.txt|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318_308.txt|It was a simple question.
p318_309.txt|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318_310.txt|And we have beaten them before.
p318_311.txt|Could you put it in writing?
p318_312.txt|I am not a paedophile.
p318_313.txt|Some of their movement was excellent.
p318_314.txt|But they had to be paid for.
p318_315.txt|The odds are that it will.
p318_316.txt|But then they scored their fourth.
p318_317.txt|They deserve a lot of credit.
p318_318.txt|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p318_319.txt|Why is that?
p318_320.txt|Then came the crunch.
p318_321.txt|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318_322.txt|But will they fall in love?
p318_323.txt|As if they ever stopped.
p318_324.txt|The referee had a shocking game.
p318_325.txt|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318_326.txt|For a few years we had good fun.
p318_327.txt|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318_328.txt|It went on to become an annual event.
p318_329.txt|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318_330.txt|We are now in an election period.
p318_331.txt|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p318_332.txt|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318_333.txt|But when we do it is great.
p318_334.txt|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p318_335.txt|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318_336.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p318_337.txt|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p318_338.txt|They've been wonderful to me.
p318_339.txt|I can't believe the buzz.
p318_340.txt|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318_341.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p318_342.txt|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p318_343.txt|It's no less intriguing, however.
p318_344.txt|It's a question of perception.
p318_345.txt|Staff have been informed.
p318_346.txt|My heart is not so sure.
p318_347.txt|This morning was very quiet.
p318_348.txt|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p318_349.txt|It has been handled entirely properly.
p318_350.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p318_351.txt|That might help a bit.
p318_352.txt|Two others were also seriously injured.
p318_353.txt|He was made redundant in February last year.
p318_354.txt|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p318_355.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p318_356.txt|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p318_357.txt|It seems very odd.
p318_358.txt|Closure is not one of them.
p318_359.txt|The hotel was huge.
p318_360.txt|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p318_361.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p318_362.txt|It was the same at Twickenham.
p318_363.txt|This is an internal matter.
p318_364.txt|I am amazed at what he's done.
p318_365.txt|They took a risk.
p318_366.txt|The idea was presented to me.
p318_367.txt|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p318_368.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318_369.txt|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318_370.txt|The hearing was fair.
p318_371.txt|I see it as my job.
p318_372.txt|This was not a summit about the euro.
p318_373.txt|Frank Warren is a great man.
p318_374.txt|I am a little bit tired.
p318_375.txt|That was never their agenda.
p318_376.txt|She died at her home.
p318_377.txt|She is currently in foster care.
p318_378.txt|That's the only thing that matters.
p318_379.txt|I enjoy the creative process.
p318_380.txt|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318_381.txt|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p318_382.txt|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p318_383.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p318_384.txt|We have been preparing all year.
p318_385.txt|We could learn a lot from them.
p318_386.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p318_387.txt|Sure, we have problems.
p318_388.txt|I was released after six days.
p318_389.txt|That time is not far away.
p318_390.txt|I may think about performing it.
p318_391.txt|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p318_392.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318_393.txt|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p318_394.txt|You can't go back and change things.
p318_395.txt|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318_396.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p318_397.txt|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p318_398.txt|He says it often enough.
p318_399.txt|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p318_400.txt|His primary residence is Scotland.
p318_401.txt|I found that much more challenging.
p318_402.txt|This fight is not going to go away.
p318_403.txt|It would have been very easily done.
p318_404.txt|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p318_405.txt|The Open champion is back.
p318_406.txt|It's going to be a new challenge.
p318_407.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p318_408.txt|I want to keep him.
p318_409.txt|He deserves a top team.
p318_410.txt|I knew people on that committee.
p318_411.txt|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318_412.txt|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p318_413.txt|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p318_414.txt|We never agreed to it.
p318_415.txt|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318_416.txt|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p318_417.txt|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318_418.txt|Would they work together again?
p318_419.txt|I didn't play all that well.
p318_420.txt|Who can tell?
p318_421.txt|It appears to have been closed down.
p318_422.txt|Now, that is a good deal.
p318_423.txt|The whole nation will be delighted.
p318_424.txt|We have no plans for direct action.
p323_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p323_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p323_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p323_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p323_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p323_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p323_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p323_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p323_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p323_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p323_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p323_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p323_025.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p323_026.txt|Film music was never the same again.
p323_027.txt|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_028.txt|Now it is much easier.
p323_029.txt|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323_030.txt|This is the best way to do it.
p323_031.txt|Its role is not to interfere.
p323_032.txt|Leisure centres were also affected.
p323_033.txt|Something happened on that island.
p323_034.txt|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
p323_035.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p323_036.txt|It is misleading to compare the two.
p323_037.txt|They discussed how he might get involved.
p323_038.txt|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_039.txt|And it had two seats.
p323_040.txt|They were not up to speed.
p323_041.txt|We know the quality of life goes up.
p323_042.txt|What is next?
p323_043.txt|Now they have found out the truth.
p323_044.txt|We've still got a say in this.
p323_045.txt|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323_046.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_047.txt|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_048.txt|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p323_049.txt|So, what's it about?
p323_050.txt|We have been let down by these people.
p323_051.txt|What's it for?
p323_052.txt|Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_053.txt|How well did they get on?
p323_054.txt|I don't think it is a drawback.
p323_055.txt|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p323_056.txt|They may have been murdered.
p323_057.txt|However this weekend it will be different.
p323_058.txt|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p323_059.txt|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_060.txt|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_061.txt|It is very difficult.
p323_062.txt|This is the place to play football.
p323_063.txt|But it was a great decision he joked.
p323_064.txt|Then they killed another three.
p323_065.txt|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p323_066.txt|The six others were injured.
p323_067.txt|Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_068.txt|We were beaten by the better team today.
p323_069.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p323_070.txt|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323_071.txt|The law has got to be upheld.
p323_072.txt|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p323_073.txt|I mean they have just been a disaster.
p323_074.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p323_075.txt|That is my personal view.
p323_076.txt|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p323_077.txt|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p323_078.txt|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_079.txt|The punishment was swift.
p323_080.txt|Who will run the bigger show?
p323_081.txt|General, You didn't get a modified.
p323_082.txt|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p323_083.txt|These things just happen.
p323_084.txt|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p323_085.txt|Are you up for business?
p323_086.txt|It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_087.txt|Who does he think will win?
p323_088.txt|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p323_089.txt|An announcement will follow in due course.
p323_090.txt|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p323_091.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p323_092.txt|Will they fall out?
p323_093.txt|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p323_094.txt|He was not able to talk to us.
p323_095.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p323_096.txt|There is no conflict of interest.
p323_097.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p323_098.txt|They are not suitable.
p323_099.txt|It does seem a mystery.
p323_100.txt|But he is something special, is he not?
p323_101.txt|Club rugby refuses to die.
p323_102.txt|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p323_103.txt|He could look after himself, but didn't.
p323_104.txt|The decision was designed to shock investors.
p323_105.txt|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p323_106.txt|We are not dealing here with refugees.
p323_107.txt|It's up to their parents to choose.
p323_108.txt|I've had a very long run.
p323_109.txt|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p323_110.txt|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p323_111.txt|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p323_112.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p323_113.txt|I have played really well all year.
p323_114.txt|We were a shambles at the back.
p323_115.txt|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p323_116.txt|No passengers were on board.
p323_117.txt|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p323_118.txt|If it does it means he has failed.
p323_119.txt|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p323_120.txt|We have a high quality product.
p323_121.txt|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p323_122.txt|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p323_123.txt|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p323_124.txt|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p323_125.txt|I have been to see him.
p323_126.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p323_127.txt|I would never say anything against her.
p323_128.txt|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
p323_129.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p323_130.txt|I see no need for change.
p323_131.txt|We are in a very strong position.
p323_132.txt|This will have no effect on the championship.
p323_133.txt|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323_134.txt|It was no more than they deserved.
p323_135.txt|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323_136.txt|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323_137.txt|Everything was a dead end.
p323_138.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p323_139.txt|I can give no comment.
p323_140.txt|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p323_141.txt|What exactly is your job?
p323_142.txt|They would love to do more films.
p323_143.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p323_144.txt|New blood is essential for progress.
p323_145.txt|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p323_146.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p323_147.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p323_148.txt|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p323_149.txt|I said, What does this mean?
p323_150.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p323_151.txt|We can do both.
p323_152.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p323_153.txt|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p323_154.txt|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p323_155.txt|The encounter was to change his life.
p323_156.txt|They should not have behaved in that way.
p323_157.txt|I've never seen them down here.
p323_158.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p323_159.txt|I got off to a great start.
p323_160.txt|It's the best of both worlds.
p323_161.txt|That is our unfinished business.
p323_162.txt|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323_163.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p323_164.txt|But it was to no avail.
p323_165.txt|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p323_166.txt|There are so many people to thank.
p323_167.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p323_168.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p323_169.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p323_170.txt|The stakes are high.
p323_171.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p323_172.txt|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p323_173.txt|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p323_174.txt|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p323_175.txt|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
p323_176.txt|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p323_177.txt|What do they do, anyway?
p323_178.txt|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p323_179.txt|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
p323_180.txt|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p323_181.txt|This is a mental challenge.
p323_182.txt|He was married with children.
p323_183.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p323_184.txt|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p323_185.txt|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p323_186.txt|The game is now open.
p323_187.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p323_188.txt|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
p323_189.txt|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p323_190.txt|It is time to come into the limelight.
p323_191.txt|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p323_192.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p323_193.txt|We have got to get it right.
p323_194.txt|You could see he was thinking about it.
p323_195.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p323_196.txt|We work for the athlete.
p323_197.txt|It was a good atmosphere.
p323_198.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p323_199.txt|It was an accounting error.
p323_200.txt|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p323_201.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p323_202.txt|She is not in a coma.
p323_203.txt|There is no reason to put me out.
p323_204.txt|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p323_205.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p323_206.txt|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p323_207.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p323_208.txt|Post offices are closing now.
p323_209.txt|I am pretty careful with money.
p323_210.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p323_211.txt|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p323_212.txt|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p323_213.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p323_214.txt|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p323_215.txt|Is being naturally funny enough?
p323_216.txt|Lack of pace is his big problem.
p323_217.txt|I have no plans to change the oath.
p323_218.txt|The process itself has taken over.
p323_219.txt|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p323_220.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p323_221.txt|He was married with a young child.
p323_222.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p323_223.txt|I became a widow overnight.
p323_224.txt|We aren't going to play better.
p323_225.txt|That was the case with David.
p323_226.txt|They loved it and it showed.
p323_227.txt|But who cares?
p323_228.txt|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p323_229.txt|That period was a struggle.
p323_230.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p323_231.txt|I am an estate agent.
p323_232.txt|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
p323_233.txt|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p323_234.txt|Is your life a little too easy?
p323_235.txt|I think my game is suited to grass.
p323_236.txt|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p323_237.txt|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p323_238.txt|Who can say?
p323_239.txt|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_240.txt|The key issue for us is public safety.
p323_241.txt|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_242.txt|I went home and wrote about it.
p323_243.txt|The result could be all down to turnout.
p323_244.txt|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p323_245.txt|There were no violations.
p323_246.txt|It appears to have been closed down.
p323_247.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p323_248.txt|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
p323_249.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p323_250.txt|So far he has not done so.
p323_251.txt|Maybe they will show it next year.
p323_252.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p323_253.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p323_254.txt|Everything is up for grabs.
p323_255.txt|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
p323_256.txt|We are a new department.
p323_257.txt|Are we here?
p323_258.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p323_259.txt|He said to me, Which one, son?
p323_260.txt|There is nothing sinister in it.
p323_261.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p323_262.txt|I've got to provide for my family.
p323_263.txt|It is having a big impact.
p323_264.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p323_265.txt|It's a very high number.
p323_266.txt|I was not happy about being left out.
p323_267.txt|Such debate is pointless.
p323_268.txt|It is a very beautiful city.
p323_269.txt|The same goes for Russia.
p323_270.txt|What do you think of the hair?
p323_271.txt|It is not great art.
p323_272.txt|You do not change overnight.
p323_273.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p323_274.txt|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p323_275.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p323_276.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p323_277.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p323_278.txt|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323_279.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p323_280.txt|Have a look at our accounts.
p323_281.txt|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p323_282.txt|It all changes for her.
p323_283.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p323_284.txt|Is it a threat to union?
p323_285.txt|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
p323_286.txt|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
p323_287.txt|Tony Blair should get out more.
p323_288.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p323_289.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p323_290.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p323_291.txt|He was just awesome.
p323_292.txt|No decision has yet been made.
p323_293.txt|Maybe his time has gone.
p323_294.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p323_295.txt|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p323_296.txt|I have never seen anything like it.
p323_297.txt|I've got the shirt.
p323_298.txt|Both were later released after a check-up.
p323_299.txt|We were a little bit nervous.
p323_300.txt|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p323_301.txt|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p323_302.txt|I first met him last summer.
p323_303.txt|Detection is often difficult.
p323_304.txt|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p323_305.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p323_306.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p323_307.txt|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p323_308.txt|We have other options.
p323_309.txt|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p323_310.txt|The son has autism and other problems.
p323_311.txt|This makes up for it.
p323_312.txt|I'm very puzzled by it.
p323_313.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p323_314.txt|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p323_315.txt|All things are possible if you believe.
p323_316.txt|The council's concern is very simple.
p323_317.txt|This was not just incongruous.
p323_318.txt|This rule is archaic.
p323_319.txt|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p323_320.txt|It was a virus.
p323_321.txt|My mother was getting on at me.
p323_322.txt|But it wasn't to be.
p323_323.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p323_324.txt|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p323_325.txt|Then there is the terrain.
p323_326.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p323_327.txt|It's such a shock.
p323_328.txt|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323_329.txt|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323_330.txt|It was very well received.
p323_331.txt|If you could find it.
p323_332.txt|Such is the ego involved.
p323_333.txt|She was totally possessed.
p323_334.txt|It was not known to myself.
p323_335.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p323_336.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p323_337.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p323_338.txt|We work on the same level.
p323_339.txt|Angola was a really hard place.
p323_340.txt|It is a love affair.
p323_341.txt|I was loving that little girl.
p323_342.txt|Everyone thought they were safe.
p323_343.txt|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323_344.txt|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p323_345.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p323_346.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p323_347.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p323_348.txt|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p323_349.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p323_350.txt|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p323_351.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p323_352.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p323_353.txt|At the same time it is a satire.
p323_354.txt|He died at the hands of his captors.
p323_355.txt|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323_356.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p323_357.txt|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p323_358.txt|This is a United Kingdom.
p323_359.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p323_360.txt|This is a critical time for football.
p323_361.txt|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p323_362.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p323_363.txt|I think she is supreme.
p323_364.txt|However, who could have predicted this result?
p323_365.txt|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p323_366.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p323_367.txt|But we're not the same person.
p323_368.txt|There are simply no orders.
p323_369.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p323_370.txt|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p323_371.txt|The problem arises because he does so much.
p323_372.txt|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
p323_373.txt|PR will be just one of them.
p323_374.txt|The answer is mayhem.
p323_375.txt|But the fans deserve to know!
p323_376.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p323_377.txt|He asked how they were doing.
p323_378.txt|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p323_379.txt|I'll have to work on that.
p323_380.txt|He must be seen to be impartial.
p323_381.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p323_382.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p323_383.txt|The law will take its course.
p323_384.txt|The idea has potential for the future.
p323_385.txt|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p323_386.txt|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p323_387.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p323_388.txt|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p323_389.txt|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p323_390.txt|There is great interest on our island.
p323_391.txt|Later they changed their minds.
p323_392.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p323_393.txt|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
p323_394.txt|I want to go home.
p323_395.txt|He already had had complaints.
p323_396.txt|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323_397.txt|Of course he does!
p323_398.txt|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p323_399.txt|The racist abuse was terrible.
p323_400.txt|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p323_401.txt|Five officers were injured.
p323_402.txt|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323_403.txt|We didn't make any of this up.
p323_404.txt|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p323_405.txt|The house was full of smoke.
p323_406.txt|A decision about that will be made today.
p323_407.txt|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p323_408.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p323_409.txt|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323_410.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p323_411.txt|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p323_412.txt|Last night, the row continued.
p323_413.txt|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p323_414.txt|Now it's all written down.
p323_415.txt|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323_416.txt|There is a spring in the step.
p323_417.txt|It's been a humbling year.
p323_418.txt|We tend to come good at the end.
p323_419.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p323_420.txt|The commission is not the only loser.
p323_421.txt|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p323_422.txt|I wish it well.
p323_423.txt|Harold is a rarity.
p323_424.txt|I want him to take on Gomez.
p326_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p326_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p326_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p326_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p326_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p326_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p326_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p326_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p326_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326_019.txt|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p326_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p326_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p326_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p326_025.txt|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p326_026.txt|The message was clear.
p326_027.txt|She is an angel.
p326_028.txt|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_029.txt|We have got to attack.
p326_030.txt|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p326_031.txt|United were in control without always being dominant.
p326_032.txt|There we were on the first tee.
p326_033.txt|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326_034.txt|At least two women were among those arrested.
p326_035.txt|How would it work?
p326_036.txt|It was my shortest audition.
p326_037.txt|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326_038.txt|She didn't tell us anything new.
p326_039.txt|There is nothing like this back home.
p326_040.txt|The police believe the man was not injured.
p326_041.txt|It would be a miracle.
p326_042.txt|We just love to chat.
p326_043.txt|I read about it in the newspapers.
p326_044.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p326_045.txt|They say they feel different.
p326_046.txt|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p326_047.txt|What on earth is wrong with you?
p326_048.txt|We will continue to pressure the Government.
p326_049.txt|His art was not just about emotions.
p326_050.txt|They are all bright and different.
p326_051.txt|I found a fault and worked at it.
p326_052.txt|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p326_053.txt|Labour was too busy to respond.
p326_054.txt|His voice is strong.
p326_055.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p326_056.txt|But they add up.
p326_057.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p326_058.txt|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p326_059.txt|This is all part of opening the door.
p326_060.txt|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326_061.txt|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326_062.txt|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p326_063.txt|He will become the sovereign.
p326_064.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p326_065.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_066.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p326_067.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_068.txt|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p326_069.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p326_070.txt|Messages have to be reinforced.
p326_071.txt|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_072.txt|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326_073.txt|The Insider opens tomorrow.
p326_074.txt|More patience and composure was required.
p326_075.txt|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326_076.txt|I was shocked and outraged.
p326_077.txt|It's just gotten too big.
p326_078.txt|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
p326_079.txt|I am immensely proud of them.
p326_080.txt|It was extremely cold.
p326_081.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p326_082.txt|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p326_083.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p326_084.txt|They were two different types.
p326_085.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p326_086.txt|I can't believe it.
p326_087.txt|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
p326_088.txt|We have them in offices all over.
p326_089.txt|It need not be like that.
p326_090.txt|There has been a sense of frustration.
p326_091.txt|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p326_092.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p326_093.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p326_094.txt|That'd be good for the whole city.
p326_095.txt|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p326_096.txt|We are very very proud of Alain.
p326_097.txt|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326_098.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p326_099.txt|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p326_100.txt|It was set in a cafe.
p326_101.txt|It certainly gives you hope.
p326_102.txt|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p326_103.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p326_104.txt|We've all been there at some point.
p326_105.txt|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_106.txt|Our people should be immune.
p326_107.txt|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p326_108.txt|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_109.txt|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p326_110.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p326_111.txt|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326_112.txt|The boys are very confident.
p326_113.txt|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326_114.txt|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326_115.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p326_116.txt|What she will do next?
p326_117.txt|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p326_118.txt|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p326_119.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p326_120.txt|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_121.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p326_122.txt|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p326_123.txt|That is a data management problem.
p326_124.txt|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_125.txt|He looked very sharp.
p326_126.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p326_127.txt|I've beaten her a few times.
p326_128.txt|His father and mother are in film production.
p326_129.txt|This is not a long-term commitment.
p326_130.txt|It's about attitudes to change.
p326_131.txt|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326_132.txt|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_133.txt|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p326_134.txt|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p326_135.txt|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p326_136.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p326_137.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p326_138.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p326_139.txt|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326_140.txt|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p326_141.txt|We are not going to forget.
p326_142.txt|I'm the one that said it.
p326_143.txt|It's not hard to get involved.
p326_144.txt|I've grown up a bit.
p326_145.txt|For a moment it was all about her.
p326_146.txt|It changed my life.
p326_147.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p326_148.txt|It's a difficult one to comment on.
p326_149.txt|Our position is clear.
p326_150.txt|Yet it does not lose appeal.
p326_151.txt|But what will we put on it?
p326_152.txt|Then in came a succession of signings.
p326_153.txt|It will benefit a lot of people.
p326_154.txt|A new school will be built.
p326_155.txt|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p326_156.txt|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p326_157.txt|I felt he was excellent.
p326_158.txt|It's not just a male agenda.
p326_159.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p326_160.txt|I think we believed the tie was won.
p326_161.txt|She wanted to move.
p326_162.txt|How do you find the youngsters?
p326_163.txt|It's always a rehearsal.
p326_164.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p326_165.txt|We all have to look in the mirror.
p326_166.txt|There is no internal damage.
p326_167.txt|About the bad things that happened to me.
p326_168.txt|She is a very lucky young lady.
p326_169.txt|It was a great team effort.
p326_170.txt|The threat to rural areas is real.
p326_171.txt|Tourism continues to struggle.
p326_172.txt|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326_173.txt|Its first awards will do just that.
p326_174.txt|We are already under pressure.
p326_175.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326_176.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p326_177.txt|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
p326_178.txt|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p326_179.txt|He didn't have long to wait.
p326_180.txt|That was merely their initial problem.
p326_181.txt|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p326_182.txt|It would be really interesting if they did.
p326_183.txt|I need them to set my career.
p326_184.txt|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
p326_185.txt|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p326_186.txt|He was all blackened.
p326_187.txt|This is your country.
p326_188.txt|I want to be there by right.
p326_189.txt|The fund has three elements.
p326_190.txt|You've just got to move on.
p326_191.txt|I feel really good.
p326_192.txt|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
p326_193.txt|This is still a young team, you know.
p326_194.txt|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
p326_195.txt|The British government said she was coming home.
p326_196.txt|It's not even finished.
p326_197.txt|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p326_198.txt|These people just lost their child.
p326_199.txt|Everyone knew where they were.
p326_200.txt|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326_201.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p326_202.txt|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p326_203.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p326_204.txt|Was this a new event?
p326_205.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p326_206.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p326_207.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p326_208.txt|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p326_209.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p326_210.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p326_211.txt|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p326_212.txt|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p326_213.txt|After that he became more romantic.
p326_214.txt|It's not long enough.
p326_215.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p326_216.txt|You're going to take away my life.
p326_217.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p326_218.txt|They finished second and third.
p326_219.txt|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_220.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p326_221.txt|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p326_222.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326_223.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p326_224.txt|People can get them if they want.
p326_225.txt|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326_226.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p326_227.txt|I was very, very happy.
p326_228.txt|No-one should see that.
p326_229.txt|We are going to go about our lives.
p326_230.txt|What is the point of jailing him?
p326_231.txt|They made it very difficult for us.
p326_232.txt|Well, there is a bed.
p326_233.txt|You write a play.
p326_234.txt|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326_235.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p326_236.txt|Seems a sensible compromise.
p326_237.txt|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p326_238.txt|I'm happy with the outcome.
p326_239.txt|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326_240.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p326_241.txt|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p326_242.txt|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326_243.txt|It is just completely erased.
p326_244.txt|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p326_245.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p326_246.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_247.txt|Scotland were on Saturday.
p326_248.txt|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p326_249.txt|Too often it is not.
p326_250.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p326_251.txt|I tend not to look back.
p326_252.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p326_253.txt|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p326_254.txt|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
p326_255.txt|I got a yellow card.
p326_256.txt|My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_257.txt|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p326_258.txt|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p326_259.txt|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326_260.txt|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326_261.txt|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p326_262.txt|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p326_263.txt|I ran to get out of the way.
p326_264.txt|She's now on the back benches.
p326_265.txt|But there are some problems.
p326_266.txt|It may also be her last.
p326_267.txt|It should not lose out in any way.
p326_268.txt|We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_269.txt|It will not be a long campaign.
p326_270.txt|Subs not used, McGraw.
p326_271.txt|Maybe it helps us.
p326_272.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p326_273.txt|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p326_274.txt|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326_275.txt|Was it just negligent.
p326_276.txt|He made no big mistakes.
p326_277.txt|It will not be today, though.
p326_278.txt|Which is a shame.
p326_279.txt|That is where our future lies.
p326_280.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326_281.txt|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_282.txt|That was enough for the committee.
p326_283.txt|We will be homeless.
p326_284.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p326_285.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p326_286.txt|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p326_287.txt|We have to focus on what is important.
p326_288.txt|They have to work so hard.
p326_289.txt|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_290.txt|Well, was it?
p326_291.txt|That's my big challenge.
p326_292.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326_293.txt|We have to adapt to this level.
p326_294.txt|So what is it with Nato?
p326_295.txt|We won't let you down.
p326_296.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p326_297.txt|There's a strong involvement.
p326_298.txt|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326_299.txt|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p326_300.txt|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p326_301.txt|English is the language of pop music.
p326_302.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p326_303.txt|It is a simple equation.
p326_304.txt|It makes a huge difference.
p326_305.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p326_306.txt|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p326_307.txt|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_308.txt|Could you put it in writing?
p326_309.txt|They play together perfectly.
p326_310.txt|We will meet again.
p326_311.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p326_312.txt|The other conditions were not specified.
p326_313.txt|They should use it on the catwalk.
p326_314.txt|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326_315.txt|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326_316.txt|It certainly sounded it at times.
p326_317.txt|Anyone can take a photo.
p326_318.txt|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p326_319.txt|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_320.txt|He is involved in everything.
p326_321.txt|Family, if you like.
p326_322.txt|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326_323.txt|I don't want to change anything.
p326_324.txt|I've only met him three times.
p326_325.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p326_326.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p326_327.txt|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p326_328.txt|We are the weakest link.
p326_329.txt|It had been on the cards.
p326_330.txt|She looked very, very poor.
p326_331.txt|He did, and he missed.
p326_332.txt|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_333.txt|Many innocent people will die.
p326_334.txt|The mood was defiant.
p326_335.txt|We have now no choice.
p326_336.txt|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_337.txt|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_338.txt|It's our worst nightmare.
p326_339.txt|We gave them the goal.
p326_340.txt|Self control is just one instalment.
p326_341.txt|It would be a massive boost for them.
p326_342.txt|You never had it so good.
p326_343.txt|Both are national treasures.
p326_344.txt|The then secretary was not amused.
p326_345.txt|I can't speak for him.
p326_346.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_347.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_348.txt|I can't see him reversing that.
p326_349.txt|He was on a horse.
p326_350.txt|I'm really looking forward to it.
p326_351.txt|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_352.txt|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p326_353.txt|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_354.txt|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p326_355.txt|He's on the wrong side.
p326_356.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p326_357.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326_358.txt|Labour is providing none of these.
p326_359.txt|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p326_360.txt|There is no musical background in his family.
p326_361.txt|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p326_362.txt|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326_363.txt|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_364.txt|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p326_366.txt|Finally action had been taken.
p326_367.txt|We're not travel agents.
p326_368.txt|It's hard not to.
p326_369.txt|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_370.txt|I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_371.txt|That's always the case, isn't it?
p326_372.txt|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p326_373.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326_374.txt|It is patently true.
p326_375.txt|They did not threaten anyone.
p326_376.txt|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p326_377.txt|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326_378.txt|But sometimes it works out all right.
p326_379.txt|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p326_380.txt|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p326_381.txt|Therein lies the problem.
p326_382.txt|You feel the pride.
p326_383.txt|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326_384.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326_385.txt|I have to keep working hard.
p326_386.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p326_387.txt|Art is still a risky investment.
p326_388.txt|That is difficult to answer.
p326_389.txt|A century on, little has changed.
p326_390.txt|Wrong decisions Address in full
p326_391.txt|My father had been unwell for many years.
p326_392.txt|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326_393.txt|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326_394.txt|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326_395.txt|It was like the old days.
p326_396.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p326_397.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p326_398.txt|Then he did it twice.
p326_399.txt|So is the rest of British sport.
p326_400.txt|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p329_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p329_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p329_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p329_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p329_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p329_025.txt|But there has never been the time, she said.
p329_026.txt|This could be one such case, he declared.
p329_027.txt|It's not a solo.
p329_028.txt|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_029.txt|I fell in love with ballet.
p329_030.txt|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329_031.txt|I had found my vision.
p329_032.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329_033.txt|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p329_034.txt|We don't know the scale of need.
p329_035.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329_036.txt|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_037.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329_038.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p329_039.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p329_040.txt|We know you will not let us down.
p329_041.txt|He will never walk the streets again.
p329_042.txt|There are big names.
p329_043.txt|That argument has been won.
p329_044.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p329_045.txt|I hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047.txt|The bill would be massive.
p329_048.txt|He was just a journalist.
p329_049.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p329_050.txt|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051.txt|I didn't have a clue.
p329_052.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p329_053.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p329_055.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p329_057.txt|It is the end of an era.
p329_058.txt|I have had no social life at all.
p329_059.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060.txt|In short, the club was broke.
p329_061.txt|His charisma is all on the course.
p329_062.txt|I am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p329_064.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p329_065.txt|It was the same old story.
p329_066.txt|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329_067.txt|The Commons is too outdated.
p329_068.txt|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329_069.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070.txt|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329_071.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p329_073.txt|He would be with his peers.
p329_074.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075.txt|This will be no easy option.
p329_076.txt|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329_077.txt|I am so sorry.
p329_078.txt|This avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079.txt|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329_080.txt|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081.txt|I was there for five hours.
p329_082.txt|But then he changed his mind.
p329_083.txt|I don't know why she is not here.
p329_084.txt|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329_085.txt|There are no excuses.
p329_086.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p329_087.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_088.txt|He just wants to play.
p329_089.txt|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_090.txt|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_091.txt|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_092.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_093.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p329_094.txt|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_095.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_096.txt|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_097.txt|Drugs are always an issue.
p329_098.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_099.txt|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_100.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329_101.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_102.txt|There is no guarantee.
p329_103.txt|We make good weapons.
p329_104.txt|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_105.txt|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329_106.txt|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_107.txt|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_108.txt|It may be argued.
p329_109.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329_110.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p329_111.txt|They agree to meet.
p329_112.txt|They could not hear.
p329_113.txt|It has been hijacked.
p329_114.txt|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_115.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p329_116.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p329_117.txt|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_118.txt|That is different from being impartial.
p329_119.txt|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_120.txt|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329_121.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p329_122.txt|David was not either.
p329_123.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_124.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_125.txt|More patience and composure was required.
p329_126.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_127.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p329_128.txt|The trial is set for February.
p329_129.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p329_130.txt|It was an ambush.
p329_131.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329_132.txt|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329_133.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p329_134.txt|Is that too much to ask?
p329_135.txt|I have so much respect for him.
p329_136.txt|Each one has its own system.
p329_137.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p329_138.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_139.txt|And that was the adults.
p329_140.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329_141.txt|That is a job for the Government.
p329_142.txt|And he had much need.
p329_143.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_144.txt|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_145.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p329_146.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_147.txt|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329_148.txt|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329_149.txt|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_150.txt|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329_151.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329_152.txt|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_153.txt|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_154.txt|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_155.txt|I guess it is down to focus.
p329_156.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329_157.txt|I have great respect for all my players.
p329_158.txt|His track record is not promising.
p329_159.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p329_160.txt|For a moment it was all about her.
p329_161.txt|It will be a great night.
p329_162.txt|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329_163.txt|Trading Places was too obvious.
p329_164.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p329_165.txt|That's the way it is.
p329_166.txt|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_167.txt|I see the extended family once a year.
p329_168.txt|I am not a magician.
p329_169.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p329_170.txt|There was even a joke.
p329_171.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p329_172.txt|You probably have never seen them before.
p329_173.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329_174.txt|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_175.txt|It is highly unlikely.
p329_176.txt|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_177.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_178.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p329_179.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p329_180.txt|I love the moment of being first.
p329_181.txt|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329_182.txt|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_183.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p329_184.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p329_185.txt|They responded with victories.
p329_186.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_187.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p329_188.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p329_189.txt|I think it's awful.
p329_190.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p329_191.txt|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_192.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329_193.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329_194.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p329_195.txt|It is a scandal.
p329_196.txt|Nor should there have been.
p329_197.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_198.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p329_199.txt|I have a theory.
p329_200.txt|But these were the nights.
p329_201.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p329_202.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329_203.txt|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_204.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p329_205.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p329_206.txt|We will not break even.
p329_207.txt|We will look into it.
p329_208.txt|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_209.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p329_210.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p329_211.txt|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_212.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p329_213.txt|We did not talk about it.
p329_214.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329_215.txt|The court has not decided.
p329_216.txt|We are opening an inquiry.
p329_217.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p329_218.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_219.txt|We find this very sad.
p329_220.txt|Four people died instantly.
p329_221.txt|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p329_222.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p329_223.txt|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_224.txt|It is a step on the way.
p329_225.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_226.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329_227.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p329_228.txt|All businesses continue to trade.
p329_229.txt|It's a difficult job.
p329_230.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_231.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_232.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p329_233.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p329_234.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_235.txt|This is my new career.
p329_236.txt|It really was a masterful innings.
p329_237.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329_238.txt|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_239.txt|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_240.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329_241.txt|I was happiest with my short game.
p329_242.txt|I leave tonight for England.
p329_243.txt|There is no change in our position.
p329_244.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p329_245.txt|We went on to become very successful.
p329_246.txt|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_247.txt|We must learn from the past.
p329_248.txt|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p329_249.txt|We told them in August.
p329_250.txt|That could be at least five years away.
p329_251.txt|That is my role.
p329_252.txt|I have no comment to make.
p329_253.txt|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_254.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p329_255.txt|I just went a bit too far.
p329_256.txt|And how he kept his word.
p329_257.txt|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_258.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_259.txt|He was a crazy man.
p329_260.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_261.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_262.txt|I have no argument with Scotland.
p329_263.txt|And a film maker was born.
p329_264.txt|It was also put on the Internet.
p329_265.txt|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329_266.txt|I hope he stays.
p329_267.txt|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_268.txt|Now that was a boxing movie.
p329_269.txt|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_270.txt|There was a battle there.
p329_271.txt|I might also completely change the routine.
p329_272.txt|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_273.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p329_274.txt|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_275.txt|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329_276.txt|I saw them not long after it happened.
p329_277.txt|He doesn't do dinner.
p329_278.txt|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_279.txt|That's a very strong element.
p329_280.txt|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_281.txt|I have beaten her a few times.
p329_282.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p329_283.txt|We are taking it seriously.
p329_284.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329_285.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p329_286.txt|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_287.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p329_288.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p329_289.txt|I have worked with him on projects.
p329_290.txt|We had no part in it.
p329_291.txt|His father and mother are in film production.
p329_292.txt|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_293.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_294.txt|The referee had been right.
p329_295.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p329_296.txt|That would have been too easy.
p329_297.txt|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_298.txt|This is not a faceless system.
p329_299.txt|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_300.txt|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301.txt|That is just a load of baloney.
p329_302.txt|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_303.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p329_304.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p329_305.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_306.txt|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_307.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p329_308.txt|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329_309.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p329_310.txt|The campaign was raucous.
p329_311.txt|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_312.txt|But both were involved with other matters.
p329_313.txt|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p329_314.txt|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329_315.txt|There is no threat to them.
p329_316.txt|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_317.txt|Nelson does not disappoint.
p329_318.txt|The woman is basically off her head.
p329_319.txt|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_320.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_321.txt|It is high time to act.
p329_322.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329_323.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329_324.txt|The South African defended his work ethic.
p329_325.txt|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_326.txt|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_327.txt|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_328.txt|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329_329.txt|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_330.txt|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329_331.txt|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p329_332.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p329_333.txt|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329_334.txt|That is not the way we should operate.
p329_335.txt|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_336.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p329_337.txt|We have nothing to hide.
p329_338.txt|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_339.txt|I'll take the blame for that.
p329_340.txt|It is now time for justice.
p329_341.txt|That is no use.
p329_342.txt|There is great interest on our island.
p329_343.txt|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_344.txt|Our house was very small.
p329_345.txt|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329_346.txt|Later they changed their minds.
p329_347.txt|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329_348.txt|First is open defiance.
p329_349.txt|That is absolute nonsense.
p329_350.txt|I just had so much fun.
p329_351.txt|It was quite rigorous.
p329_352.txt|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_353.txt|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_354.txt|Their mind was already made up.
p329_355.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_356.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p329_357.txt|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_358.txt|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_359.txt|Pray that it is so.
p329_360.txt|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329_361.txt|There was support from across the board.
p329_362.txt|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_363.txt|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_364.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p329_365.txt|We have been preparing all year.
p329_366.txt|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_367.txt|So what does one do?
p329_368.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p329_369.txt|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_370.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_371.txt|I joined a group.
p329_372.txt|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_373.txt|They probably expected something special from me.
p329_374.txt|But we could not change his mind.
p329_375.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p329_376.txt|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329_377.txt|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_378.txt|I see no reason for them to be.
p329_379.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_380.txt|I never agreed with that.
p329_381.txt|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_382.txt|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_383.txt|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329_384.txt|It is a dilemma.
p329_385.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_386.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_387.txt|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_388.txt|They did not interfere.
p329_389.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_390.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_391.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_392.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p329_393.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p329_394.txt|As if he were a High Court judge.
p329_395.txt|And that started me thinking.
p329_396.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p329_397.txt|It brings together two essential elements.
p329_398.txt|The issue has still to be resolved.
p329_399.txt|He is a joy to watch.
p329_400.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_401.txt|We are now open.
p329_402.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_403.txt|Who has he fought?
p329_404.txt|The film is about the cost of genius.
p329_405.txt|They've been here before.
p329_406.txt|I want a free vote.
p329_407.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p329_408.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p329_409.txt|Players were held in equally low regard.
p329_410.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_411.txt|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p329_412.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329_413.txt|They have the cash to do that.
p329_414.txt|He was not seeking special advantage.
p329_415.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p329_416.txt|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_417.txt|It is so elusive and light.
p329_418.txt|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p329_419.txt|We've come from a long way back.
p329_420.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p329_421.txt|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p329_422.txt|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329_423.txt|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_424.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p330_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p330_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p330_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p330_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p330_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p330_025.txt|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p330_026.txt|I was backing him up.
p330_027.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p330_028.txt|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_029.txt|That was their attitude.
p330_030.txt|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_031.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p330_032.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p330_033.txt|And it had two seats.
p330_034.txt|They could move in at any moment.
p330_035.txt|There were no reported injuries.
p330_036.txt|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330_037.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_038.txt|It is my nature.
p330_039.txt|Or so she thought.
p330_040.txt|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_041.txt|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_042.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p330_043.txt|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330_044.txt|Our decision making was poor.
p330_045.txt|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_046.txt|They said we were out of touch.
p330_047.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_048.txt|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_049.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p330_050.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_051.txt|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p330_052.txt|He has one son and one daughter.
p330_053.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p330_054.txt|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_055.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p330_056.txt|We shall not forget him.
p330_057.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p330_058.txt|I think they should have more respect.
p330_059.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p330_060.txt|This is a big club.
p330_061.txt|I find it rather oppressive.
p330_062.txt|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330_063.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_064.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p330_065.txt|We have to expand.
p330_066.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067.txt|We gave everything we had.
p330_068.txt|I think it is a release of tension.
p330_069.txt|This is a most serious matter.
p330_070.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071.txt|It is also very valuable.
p330_072.txt|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_073.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_074.txt|This makes up for it.
p330_075.txt|This is purely financial.
p330_076.txt|I want to help other women.
p330_077.txt|The problem is Labour.
p330_078.txt|The way ahead is not easy.
p330_079.txt|I could do a better job.
p330_080.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_081.txt|An announcement will follow in due course.
p330_082.txt|I am here to play football.
p330_083.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p330_084.txt|That is the crunch.
p330_085.txt|I did not want any damage to us.
p330_086.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p330_087.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p330_088.txt|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p330_089.txt|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_090.txt|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p330_093.txt|This will be great for the young lads.
p330_094.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095.txt|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_096.txt|What do we do for an encore?
p330_097.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_098.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p330_099.txt|There's nothing for the kids.
p330_100.txt|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_101.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_102.txt|The feeling is marvellous.
p330_103.txt|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_104.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p330_105.txt|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p330_106.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_107.txt|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_108.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_109.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p330_110.txt|The money is not really our concern.
p330_111.txt|You just know it.
p330_112.txt|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_113.txt|Don't say you have not been warned.
p330_114.txt|Some were close to tears.
p330_115.txt|Seven children had lost both parents.
p330_116.txt|So, how will it be received in the US?
p330_117.txt|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330_118.txt|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_119.txt|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p330_120.txt|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p330_121.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p330_122.txt|Some people still think she should be English.
p330_123.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_124.txt|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330_125.txt|Who will perform?
p330_126.txt|It's like a high school play.
p330_127.txt|He was part of South Africa.
p330_128.txt|It's much more dynamic.
p330_129.txt|The party will make up its own mind.
p330_130.txt|What do they pay to join the club?
p330_131.txt|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_132.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_133.txt|We are now in a safe place.
p330_134.txt|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_135.txt|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330_136.txt|It will be very useful for us.
p330_137.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p330_138.txt|We told them in July.
p330_139.txt|It's like a garage.
p330_140.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p330_141.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p330_142.txt|The answer is with ourselves.
p330_143.txt|That is the last thing they need.
p330_144.txt|Was society doing enough?
p330_145.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p330_146.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p330_147.txt|He changed my life.
p330_148.txt|There was nothing else to match it.
p330_149.txt|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_150.txt|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p330_151.txt|They have worked with each other.
p330_152.txt|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p330_153.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_154.txt|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330_155.txt|His parenthood is called into question.
p330_156.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_157.txt|But it could have been written for her.
p330_158.txt|His only reply was a laugh.
p330_159.txt|I'm really looking forward to it.
p330_160.txt|A report will be issued by March.
p330_161.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p330_162.txt|The party lasted all night.
p330_163.txt|I was delighted with every one of them.
p330_164.txt|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330_165.txt|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p330_166.txt|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330_167.txt|I was proud of our lads.
p330_168.txt|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p330_169.txt|This is not a Scottish problem.
p330_170.txt|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p330_171.txt|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_172.txt|After that, we made some changes.
p330_173.txt|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_174.txt|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_175.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p330_176.txt|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_177.txt|I have no battle with the Scots.
p330_178.txt|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p330_179.txt|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_180.txt|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330_181.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p330_182.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p330_183.txt|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330_184.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p330_185.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_186.txt|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_187.txt|He went to see what he could learn.
p330_188.txt|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p330_189.txt|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_190.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p330_191.txt|It has all been positive.
p330_192.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p330_193.txt|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330_194.txt|No government has that right.
p330_195.txt|The luxury has been well used.
p330_196.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_197.txt|Billie was yet to be born.
p330_198.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p330_199.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p330_200.txt|This is a good result for them.
p330_201.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_202.txt|There was no time scale.
p330_203.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p330_204.txt|She was right about the struggle.
p330_205.txt|Only the scale of change differed.
p330_206.txt|That was one very hard game.
p330_207.txt|I think the euro has slipped.
p330_208.txt|We began to walk down.
p330_209.txt|I will not take you out of context.
p330_210.txt|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p330_211.txt|The cold war is over.
p330_212.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p330_213.txt|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_214.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p330_215.txt|It had to be more flexible.
p330_216.txt|We are not far from a deal.
p330_217.txt|Are there muscular problems?
p330_218.txt|You remember how long he lasted?
p330_219.txt|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_220.txt|Ordering online was very easy.
p330_221.txt|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_222.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p330_223.txt|I think it is a great idea.
p330_224.txt|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_225.txt|But it's just great to have won.
p330_226.txt|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_227.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p330_228.txt|All these women were actors.
p330_229.txt|I've got no secret.
p330_230.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p330_231.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_232.txt|What happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_233.txt|I never made any offer to Mark.
p330_234.txt|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235.txt|That is the first thing we need.
p330_236.txt|Will they ever reopen?
p330_237.txt|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_238.txt|We have great team spirit.
p330_239.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_240.txt|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_241.txt|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_242.txt|You would fall over, he said.
p330_243.txt|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_244.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p330_245.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_246.txt|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330_247.txt|They are also exploited by the markets.
p330_248.txt|The principle is quite clear.
p330_249.txt|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_250.txt|The board of governors must act.
p330_251.txt|We must all play our part.
p330_252.txt|I first met him last summer.
p330_253.txt|It was to be published next month.
p330_254.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p330_255.txt|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_256.txt|It could have been a hammering by now.
p330_257.txt|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_258.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_259.txt|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p330_260.txt|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330_261.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_262.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p330_263.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p330_264.txt|He will decide tomorrow.
p330_265.txt|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_266.txt|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p330_267.txt|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p330_268.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_269.txt|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p330_270.txt|That is our main aim.
p330_271.txt|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330_272.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p330_273.txt|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_274.txt|All kinds of things occur.
p330_275.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p330_276.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p330_277.txt|The film has also been superbly designed.
p330_278.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p330_279.txt|It is always the same, isn't it?
p330_280.txt|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330_281.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p330_282.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p330_283.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_284.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p330_285.txt|There is precious little middle ground.
p330_286.txt|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p330_287.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p330_288.txt|They were both delightful to work with.
p330_289.txt|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_290.txt|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p330_291.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p330_292.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p330_293.txt|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_294.txt|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_295.txt|There were no formal announcements.
p330_296.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p330_297.txt|That was quite an interesting part.
p330_298.txt|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_299.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p330_300.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p330_301.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p330_302.txt|Chris is big and jolly.
p330_303.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p330_304.txt|It became a national network.
p330_305.txt|They still have the dirty work to do.
p330_306.txt|I do not want to wait until May.
p330_307.txt|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330_308.txt|We really need research to help with that.
p330_309.txt|We all work for nothing.
p330_310.txt|It is extremely popular with families.
p330_311.txt|He will do very well.
p330_312.txt|It was a cry for help.
p330_313.txt|They also intend to travel today.
p330_314.txt|There's a lot of hysteria.
p330_315.txt|The casualties were not named.
p330_316.txt|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p330_317.txt|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_318.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_319.txt|It's just that we see different things.
p330_320.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p330_321.txt|I am very happy with life.
p330_322.txt|We are all family men with children.
p330_323.txt|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_324.txt|We've had our problems at the club.
p330_325.txt|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_326.txt|They were at her bedside when she died.
p330_327.txt|I think we showed that after half time.
p330_328.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p330_329.txt|I am not in denial.
p330_330.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p330_331.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p330_332.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_333.txt|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_334.txt|What are you waiting for?
p330_335.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p330_336.txt|Will he be given time?
p330_337.txt|You let a lot of people down.
p330_338.txt|It's annoying in a way.
p330_339.txt|The result today is an impasse.
p330_340.txt|It would have to be backdated.
p330_341.txt|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330_342.txt|It is like being a qualifier again.
p330_343.txt|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p330_344.txt|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p330_345.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_346.txt|She is very upset.
p330_347.txt|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_348.txt|It was a poor performance.
p330_349.txt|We are very very proud of Alain.
p330_350.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p330_351.txt|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_352.txt|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p330_353.txt|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_354.txt|It is patently true.
p330_355.txt|I've got my own ideas.
p330_356.txt|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_357.txt|They might want to play.
p330_358.txt|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330_359.txt|Our people should be immune.
p330_360.txt|It is simple and easy to use.
p330_361.txt|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_362.txt|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p330_363.txt|It is the way they work.
p330_364.txt|This was another video cassette.
p330_365.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_366.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p330_367.txt|I think we finished fifth.
p330_368.txt|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_369.txt|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330_370.txt|I have chosen to do this research.
p330_371.txt|That's the law of the land.
p330_372.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_373.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p330_374.txt|He wouldn't do it.
p330_375.txt|I don't know exactly what happened.
p330_376.txt|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_377.txt|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_378.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_379.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p330_380.txt|Debate is not just talk.
p330_381.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_382.txt|Neither was involved in violence.
p330_383.txt|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p330_384.txt|So people will come out with these things.
p330_385.txt|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_386.txt|I am not a happy man.
p330_387.txt|Was it just negligent.
p330_388.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p330_389.txt|If only we had known.
p330_390.txt|The line-up is a tasty one.
p330_391.txt|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330_392.txt|She was my big sister.
p330_393.txt|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_394.txt|They will now get that support.
p330_395.txt|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_396.txt|Then  all was revealed.
p330_397.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p330_398.txt|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_399.txt|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_400.txt|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p330_401.txt|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330_402.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p330_403.txt|They had given up on him.
p330_404.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p330_405.txt|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_406.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p330_407.txt|I am greatly encouraged.
p330_408.txt|They offer a kind of narrative.
p330_409.txt|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330_410.txt|What does he want him to look like?
p330_411.txt|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_412.txt|What is next?
p330_413.txt|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330_414.txt|It's nothing to do with me.
p330_415.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p330_416.txt|You have to work with what you've got.
p330_417.txt|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_418.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_419.txt|This is about the Orange Order.
p330_420.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p330_421.txt|We will do so again.
p330_422.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p330_423.txt|I have no problem with that.
p333_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p333_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p333_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p333_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p333_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333_025.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_026.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333_027.txt|But who shot the president?
p333_028.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333_030.txt|All would be under threat.
p333_031.txt|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_032.txt|There are moments of silence.
p333_033.txt|So now this series has had its day.
p333_034.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_035.txt|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p333_036.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p333_037.txt|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p333_038.txt|Too many factors are now working against him.
p333_039.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p333_040.txt|It is time for a new approach.
p333_041.txt|We have nothing to say about that.
p333_042.txt|We've tried every other way.
p333_043.txt|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p333_044.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p333_045.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p333_046.txt|It does make a big difference.
p333_047.txt|Do not forget about Monaco.
p333_048.txt|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333_049.txt|You can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050.txt|Everything was an effort.
p333_051.txt|And does it even matter?
p333_052.txt|This is the same old story.
p333_053.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054.txt|My parents are exhausted.
p333_055.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p333_056.txt|The performance was excellent.
p333_057.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p333_058.txt|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p333_059.txt|It will come up here.
p333_060.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p333_061.txt|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062.txt|The chief constable is right.
p333_063.txt|I didn't expect to get one.
p333_064.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065.txt|This is only the start of my season.
p333_066.txt|It sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p333_068.txt|John was a very nice man.
p333_069.txt|This is a big, big win.
p333_070.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p333_071.txt|Every game against New Zealand is.
p333_072.txt|The jury is still out on this one.
p333_073.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074.txt|That would have killed the match.
p333_075.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p333_076.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p333_078.txt|I think we will join the single currency.
p333_079.txt|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080.txt|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081.txt|They wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082.txt|It runs until the beginning of June.
p333_083.txt|All of us do.
p333_084.txt|But will they fall in love?
p333_085.txt|It was different from our other work.
p333_086.txt|That is in the public domain.
p333_087.txt|The Hague is too good for him.
p333_088.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p333_089.txt|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p333_090.txt|It's a true story.
p333_091.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p333_092.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p333_093.txt|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333_094.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p333_095.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p333_096.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p333_097.txt|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_098.txt|There was no option.
p333_099.txt|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333_100.txt|Could they perhaps be related?
p333_101.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p333_102.txt|We all thought we were going to die.
p333_103.txt|Maybe he will act again.
p333_104.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p333_105.txt|That's why he visited.
p333_106.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p333_107.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p333_108.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p333_109.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p333_110.txt|It needs somebody to give way.
p333_111.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333_112.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_113.txt|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_114.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p333_115.txt|I thought he was terrific.
p333_116.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p333_117.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_118.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_119.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p333_120.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p333_121.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_122.txt|A venue was found.
p333_123.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p333_124.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p333_125.txt|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333_126.txt|This is our way to make our point.
p333_127.txt|It was a disaster.
p333_128.txt|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p333_129.txt|He was back to square one.
p333_130.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333_131.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p333_132.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p333_133.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333_134.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333_135.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_136.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p333_137.txt|All the people thought that he would die.
p333_138.txt|It is never an easy game.
p333_139.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_140.txt|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_141.txt|The post will run for four years.
p333_142.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p333_143.txt|He had reason to be pleased.
p333_144.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p333_145.txt|That is impressive by any standards.
p333_146.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_147.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333_148.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p333_149.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_150.txt|The Scots are great.
p333_151.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p333_152.txt|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p333_153.txt|I will certainly be having words with him.
p333_154.txt|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_155.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p333_156.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_157.txt|But he is not using them.
p333_158.txt|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333_159.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_160.txt|We are not moving in.
p333_161.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p333_162.txt|That's been our position all along.
p333_163.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p333_164.txt|There are no charges.
p333_165.txt|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_166.txt|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_167.txt|I am very, very happy.
p333_168.txt|They got the job done.
p333_169.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p333_170.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333_171.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p333_172.txt|It's going to be epic.
p333_173.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333_174.txt|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_175.txt|He just carried on filming.
p333_176.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p333_177.txt|I never found my rhythm.
p333_178.txt|I didn't mean to kill her.
p333_179.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p333_180.txt|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p333_181.txt|We might be back next year.
p333_182.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_183.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p333_184.txt|In a way he was.
p333_185.txt|This area is perfect for children.
p333_186.txt|No, they have not.
p333_187.txt|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_188.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p333_189.txt|I was chosen to do this.
p333_190.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p333_191.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p333_192.txt|I have been very nervous.
p333_193.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_194.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p333_195.txt|There was no happy ending.
p333_196.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_197.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p333_198.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p333_199.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_200.txt|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_201.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_202.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_203.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333_204.txt|It is legally binding.
p333_205.txt|It has come as a bombshell.
p333_206.txt|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_207.txt|We didn't know he was even out.
p333_208.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_209.txt|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_210.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p333_211.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p333_212.txt|We still don't know.
p333_213.txt|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_215.txt|This is a foolish idea.
p333_216.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p333_217.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_218.txt|Or some thought that they have.
p333_219.txt|If only we had known.
p333_220.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_221.txt|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333_222.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_223.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p333_224.txt|It could not be too high.
p333_225.txt|How many cases have there been?
p333_226.txt|I hope they understand that.
p333_227.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p333_228.txt|But Annika is just amazing.
p333_229.txt|Our job is to change that.
p333_230.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p333_231.txt|It's because they can't understand the language.
p333_232.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p333_233.txt|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p333_234.txt|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p333_235.txt|What's it all about?
p333_236.txt|It is a big time for me.
p333_237.txt|There were two things going on at once.
p333_238.txt|It's something we want to make work.
p333_239.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p333_240.txt|We are all equal.
p333_241.txt|That is the key message.
p333_242.txt|It ignores the future.
p333_243.txt|This is the subway.
p333_244.txt|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_245.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_246.txt|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_247.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_248.txt|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p333_249.txt|He's in with the furniture.
p333_250.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p333_251.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333_252.txt|Who will provide the wine?
p333_253.txt|We are still getting signals.
p333_254.txt|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p333_255.txt|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333_256.txt|We started from scratch.
p333_257.txt|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_258.txt|There are a few changes.
p333_259.txt|You're not going to get hurt.
p333_260.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_261.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333_262.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_263.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p333_264.txt|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_265.txt|It has to be funded.
p333_266.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333_267.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p333_268.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p333_269.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p333_270.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333_271.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p333_272.txt|That's a very strong element.
p333_273.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p333_274.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p333_275.txt|It was a journey into a new life.
p333_276.txt|It's a way of making a mark.
p333_277.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_278.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p333_279.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p333_280.txt|We know we can't rely on you.
p333_281.txt|Arguably, they have already done it.
p333_282.txt|It was indeed a night to remember.
p333_283.txt|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_284.txt|There is something in this.
p333_285.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_286.txt|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333_287.txt|There are no plans to change this.
p333_288.txt|It's too big a risk to take.
p333_289.txt|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_290.txt|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333_291.txt|It is just too long since the war.
p333_292.txt|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_293.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p333_294.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_295.txt|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333_296.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p333_297.txt|And sooner than we may think.
p333_298.txt|Raised the way you want it.
p333_299.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p333_300.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p333_301.txt|I will carry on.
p333_302.txt|A review of the decision is being sought.
p333_303.txt|I made a mistake.
p333_304.txt|It is a very special city.
p333_305.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_306.txt|They certainly do not socialise.
p333_307.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_308.txt|I think that could work to our advantage.
p333_309.txt|Was that not awful?
p333_310.txt|That was him under pressure.
p333_311.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_312.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_313.txt|I'm not blaming audiences.
p333_315.txt|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_316.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p333_317.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p333_318.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333_319.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p333_320.txt|We will just get on with it.
p333_321.txt|We are worried about casualties.
p333_322.txt|This is my music.
p333_323.txt|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_324.txt|I haven't won the world title.
p333_325.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p333_326.txt|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_327.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_328.txt|And now he tells us.
p333_329.txt|I am not changing my event.
p333_330.txt|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_331.txt|This Patton will also return.
p333_332.txt|That is as it may be.
p333_333.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p333_334.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p333_335.txt|Eleven events are required.
p333_336.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333_337.txt|You encourage them - you can do it.
p333_338.txt|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_339.txt|I always said No.
p333_340.txt|The stadium was full.
p333_341.txt|Cinema is a communal experience.
p333_342.txt|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333_343.txt|He was different from the rest of us.
p333_344.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p333_345.txt|He's got a great chance of making it.
p333_346.txt|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_347.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p333_348.txt|So now you know.
p333_349.txt|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p333_350.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_351.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_352.txt|The feeling is awesome.
p333_353.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p333_354.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p333_355.txt|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_356.txt|Which he can do.
p333_357.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p333_358.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p333_359.txt|They were that poor.
p333_360.txt|And we're talking Big Money.
p333_361.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_362.txt|They have two children.
p333_363.txt|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p333_364.txt|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_365.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_366.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p333_367.txt|There was a great support all round the route.
p333_368.txt|They should feel ashamed.
p333_369.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_370.txt|Both managements are very supportive.
p333_371.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p333_372.txt|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_373.txt|This is important for two reasons.
p333_374.txt|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_375.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_376.txt|You will not feel a thing.
p333_377.txt|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333_378.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p333_379.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p333_380.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p333_381.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p333_382.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p333_383.txt|Is that where we are?
p333_384.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p333_385.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p333_386.txt|But there's no eye contact.
p333_387.txt|There was no energy behind it.
p333_388.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p333_389.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_390.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p333_391.txt|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_392.txt|It is not a wish list.
p333_393.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333_394.txt|If not, he should go home.
p333_395.txt|There is no margin for error.
p333_396.txt|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p333_397.txt|I get very excited by that.
p333_398.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333_399.txt|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p333_400.txt|Which means it matters.
p333_401.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p333_402.txt|There is a great potential on this river.
p333_403.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p333_404.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p333_405.txt|They hold on for many years.
p333_406.txt|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p333_407.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333_408.txt|There's nothing for you here.
p333_409.txt|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333_410.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_411.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p333_412.txt|I have not come in to take over.
p333_413.txt|Is this accurate?
p333_414.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p333_415.txt|I want to win this thing.
p333_416.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p333_417.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p333_418.txt|I'd just like to play.
p333_419.txt|They were in good humour, too.
p333_420.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p333_421.txt|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333_422.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333_423.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p333_424.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p334_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p334_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p334_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p334_025.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_026.txt|I want to win this thing.
p334_027.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p334_028.txt|I'd just like to play.
p334_029.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p334_030.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p334_031.txt|It was no surprise.
p334_032.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_033.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_034.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_035.txt|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_036.txt|We could feel the heat.
p334_037.txt|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334_038.txt|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_039.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p334_040.txt|I wanted to win so badly.
p334_041.txt|It was an accounting error.
p334_042.txt|I had enough on.
p334_043.txt|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p334_045.txt|And we're not there yet.
p334_046.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p334_047.txt|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p334_048.txt|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p334_049.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334_050.txt|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051.txt|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053.txt|plays in dark blue.
p334_054.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p334_055.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p334_056.txt|Why do it?
p334_057.txt|It could take three days.
p334_058.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p334_059.txt|It was totally my fault.
p334_060.txt|Or so everyone believed.
p334_061.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p334_062.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063.txt|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064.txt|He's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067.txt|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_068.txt|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070.txt|He will need that machine.
p334_071.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p334_072.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p334_073.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074.txt|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075.txt|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p334_077.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p334_078.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079.txt|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080.txt|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p334_083.txt|This must be really short of ideas.
p334_084.txt|It was extremely cold.
p334_085.txt|They use them for everything.
p334_086.txt|We have the easy part.
p334_087.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p334_088.txt|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334_089.txt|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_090.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334_091.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p334_092.txt|We already have them, all over Europe.
p334_093.txt|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_094.txt|Libya is an easy target.
p334_095.txt|I thought they played very well.
p334_096.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p334_097.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p334_098.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p334_099.txt|They chose to side with terror.
p334_100.txt|Justice was not seen today.
p334_101.txt|I would never even consider it.
p334_102.txt|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_103.txt|We should just say no.
p334_104.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p334_105.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p334_106.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p334_107.txt|I didn't make those adjustments.
p334_108.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_109.txt|We have it on video.
p334_110.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334_111.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334_112.txt|It didn't take long.
p334_113.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_114.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p334_115.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334_116.txt|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p334_117.txt|He told the conference.
p334_118.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_119.txt|We tend to come good at the end.
p334_120.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p334_121.txt|It's not one for the purist.
p334_122.txt|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_123.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p334_124.txt|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334_125.txt|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_126.txt|It is a time bomb.
p334_127.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p334_128.txt|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_129.txt|We are taking advice on this.
p334_130.txt|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_131.txt|It was just an accident of birth.
p334_132.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334_133.txt|It was a simple question.
p334_134.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p334_135.txt|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p334_136.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p334_137.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p334_138.txt|Could you put it in writing?
p334_139.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p334_140.txt|We all thought we were going to die.
p334_141.txt|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_142.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334_143.txt|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_144.txt|The world is split into two.
p334_145.txt|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_146.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_147.txt|It was so physical.
p334_148.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_149.txt|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p334_150.txt|Why is that?
p334_151.txt|It is extremely sad.
p334_153.txt|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_154.txt|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334_155.txt|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_156.txt|He was not deterred.
p334_157.txt|This commitment should be built upon.
p334_158.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p334_159.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334_160.txt|That is not just my personal view.
p334_161.txt|The investment will be in the food.
p334_162.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p334_163.txt|The problem is the pitch.
p334_164.txt|That's as it should be.
p334_165.txt|It does seem a mystery.
p334_166.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p334_167.txt|He looked very sharp.
p334_168.txt|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_169.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p334_170.txt|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_171.txt|I see no need for change.
p334_172.txt|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_173.txt|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334_174.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p334_175.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334_176.txt|But we have come under attack.
p334_177.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_178.txt|What do they do, anyway?
p334_179.txt|He was just like a godfather to it.
p334_180.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p334_181.txt|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_182.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_183.txt|That is his attitude to things.
p334_184.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_185.txt|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334_186.txt|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_187.txt|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_188.txt|No finals are to be contested today.
p334_189.txt|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334_190.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_191.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p334_192.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_193.txt|It is in our own hands.
p334_194.txt|This is a step backwards.
p334_195.txt|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_196.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p334_197.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334_198.txt|I'm not changing my mind.
p334_199.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334_200.txt|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_201.txt|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_202.txt|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_203.txt|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_204.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_205.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_206.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p334_207.txt|The frustration was showing.
p334_208.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334_209.txt|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334_210.txt|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_211.txt|My friends were very envious.
p334_212.txt|But who cares?
p334_213.txt|The house was full of smoke.
p334_214.txt|The approval system will be changed.
p334_215.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p334_216.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334_217.txt|That period was a struggle.
p334_218.txt|We are determined to establish the facts.
p334_219.txt|You just have to accept.
p334_220.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p334_221.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p334_222.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p334_223.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334_224.txt|I can't blame the fans.
p334_225.txt|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_226.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p334_227.txt|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_228.txt|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_229.txt|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334_230.txt|So far they have refused.
p334_231.txt|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_232.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p334_233.txt|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334_234.txt|He took my breath away.
p334_235.txt|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_236.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p334_237.txt|After that it is up to the boss.
p334_238.txt|I never wanted a legal battle.
p334_239.txt|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334_240.txt|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_241.txt|It had won an investors in people award.
p334_242.txt|A venue was found.
p334_243.txt|They are not an item.
p334_244.txt|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334_245.txt|Is that Titanic?
p334_246.txt|He was to get his chance.
p334_247.txt|So, the question is, is it any good?
p334_248.txt|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_249.txt|That's why they go to the opera.
p334_250.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p334_251.txt|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_252.txt|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334_253.txt|I'm getting back up there now.
p334_254.txt|Check that he is dead.
p334_255.txt|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_256.txt|My players have no idea about football.
p334_257.txt|They are there to get people into work.
p334_258.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334_259.txt|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_260.txt|They would be wise to do just that.
p334_261.txt|He was sentenced to seven years.
p334_262.txt|That, he claimed, was essential.
p334_263.txt|I would like Glasgow.
p334_264.txt|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334_265.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_266.txt|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_267.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p334_268.txt|I may think about performing it.
p334_269.txt|I would recommend it.
p334_270.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p334_271.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334_272.txt|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334_273.txt|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334_274.txt|You can't go back and change things.
p334_275.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p334_276.txt|This is a lie.
p334_277.txt|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334_278.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p334_279.txt|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_280.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p334_281.txt|They'll have to pay more.
p334_282.txt|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_283.txt|Does it, Noel?
p334_284.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_285.txt|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334_286.txt|The Open champion is back.
p334_287.txt|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_288.txt|It's the taking part that counts.
p334_289.txt|They married in August last year.
p334_290.txt|I want to keep him.
p334_291.txt|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_292.txt|You've been a great audience.
p334_293.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_294.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p334_295.txt|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_296.txt|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334_297.txt|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_298.txt|People are fed up.
p334_299.txt|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_300.txt|It's a sign of the times.
p334_301.txt|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_302.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p334_303.txt|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334_304.txt|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_305.txt|He is a Satan.
p334_306.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p334_307.txt|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_308.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p334_309.txt|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334_310.txt|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_311.txt|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_312.txt|The public have been very supportive.
p334_313.txt|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p334_314.txt|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p334_315.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p334_316.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p334_317.txt|It seems a little short to me.
p334_318.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p334_319.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p334_320.txt|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p334_321.txt|I welcome this new service.
p334_322.txt|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_323.txt|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_324.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_325.txt|It was a UK-wide report.
p334_326.txt|The law should be changed.
p334_327.txt|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_328.txt|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334_329.txt|I will be standing.
p334_330.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334_331.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_332.txt|Are you from the rugby?
p334_333.txt|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_334.txt|The plot is simple.
p334_335.txt|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_336.txt|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_337.txt|With actors it is slightly different.
p334_338.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334_339.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p334_340.txt|What did we learn?
p334_341.txt|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_342.txt|I knew he was dying.
p334_343.txt|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_344.txt|He loved his children.
p334_345.txt|She wondered why we were interested.
p334_346.txt|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_347.txt|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_348.txt|I am content with the silver.
p334_349.txt|People acted too quickly.
p334_350.txt|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334_351.txt|We took the chances when they came.
p334_352.txt|You have to audition for jobs.
p334_353.txt|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_354.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p334_355.txt|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_356.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_357.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_358.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334_359.txt|It gave no further details.
p334_360.txt|This man is serious about his work.
p334_361.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p334_362.txt|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_363.txt|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334_364.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_365.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334_366.txt|We will miss him very much.
p334_367.txt|This was a chilling echo.
p334_368.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334_369.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_370.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p334_371.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p334_372.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334_373.txt|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_374.txt|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_375.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_376.txt|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_377.txt|His third goal was superb.
p334_378.txt|Here we have not had one hour.
p334_379.txt|He said to me, Which one, son?
p334_380.txt|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_381.txt|His son is a local legend.
p334_382.txt|I was so nervous.
p334_383.txt|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_384.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p334_385.txt|It's to do with context.
p334_386.txt|This fight is not going to go away.
p334_387.txt|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334_388.txt|I just don't know where he is.
p334_389.txt|Would you take them?
p334_390.txt|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_391.txt|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_392.txt|He would take up the bike.
p334_393.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p334_394.txt|He sat down at the piano.
p334_395.txt|His condition was stable last night.
p334_396.txt|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_397.txt|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_398.txt|I'm sure they love it.
p334_399.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p334_400.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p334_401.txt|And they all had these other commitments.
p334_402.txt|The report is due out next month.
p334_403.txt|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334_404.txt|We are going to change our party.
p334_405.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p334_406.txt|This seems like a very good idea.
p334_407.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p334_408.txt|It remains in public ownership.
p334_409.txt|The Master was by then just too old.
p334_410.txt|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334_411.txt|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334_412.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p334_413.txt|The hangover was Olympian.
p334_414.txt|We are here for the long term.
p334_415.txt|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p334_416.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p334_417.txt|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334_418.txt|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p334_419.txt|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_420.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334_421.txt|I think it is totally wrong.
p334_422.txt|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_423.txt|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p334_424.txt|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p335_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p335_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p335_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p335_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p335_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p335_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p335_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p335_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p335_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p335_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p335_025.txt|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p335_026.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p335_027.txt|I believe in the Church.
p335_028.txt|Let's not go overboard.
p335_029.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p335_030.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p335_031.txt|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p335_032.txt|Well, what do you know?
p335_033.txt|But she was very human.
p335_034.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p335_035.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p335_036.txt|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p335_037.txt|There were no proposals on the table.
p335_038.txt|Who does he think will win?
p335_039.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p335_040.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p335_041.txt|I only half believed it.
p335_042.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p335_043.txt|All the oil companies are talking together.
p335_044.txt|The failings are serious.
p335_045.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p335_046.txt|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_047.txt|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p335_048.txt|On reflection, it is more than that.
p335_049.txt|It is not normal practice.
p335_050.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p335_051.txt|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p335_052.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p335_053.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p335_054.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p335_055.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p335_056.txt|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p335_057.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p335_058.txt|Let's see that increase over the years.
p335_059.txt|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p335_060.txt|These findings would be made public.
p335_061.txt|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335_062.txt|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p335_063.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p335_064.txt|This must be wrong.
p335_065.txt|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p335_066.txt|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p335_067.txt|I go home only once.
p335_068.txt|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_069.txt|It is a family day out.
p335_070.txt|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p335_071.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p335_072.txt|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p335_073.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p335_074.txt|The team this year is going places.
p335_075.txt|We should do everything at a stroke.
p335_076.txt|He had a moustache.
p335_077.txt|It's just for me.
p335_078.txt|History is usually written by the victors.
p335_079.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p335_080.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p335_081.txt|That would be dangerous.
p335_082.txt|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335_083.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p335_084.txt|They're completely different from each other.
p335_085.txt|He was extremely nervous.
p335_086.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p335_087.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p335_088.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p335_089.txt|We still don't know what's happened.
p335_090.txt|His team management was protective.
p335_091.txt|The proposal was rejected.
p335_092.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p335_093.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p335_094.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p335_095.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p335_096.txt|I would think they are just behind them.
p335_097.txt|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p335_098.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p335_099.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p335_100.txt|There are nine people here now.
p335_101.txt|I like what has happened!
p335_102.txt|This would not be my first choice.
p335_103.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p335_104.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p335_105.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p335_106.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p335_107.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p335_108.txt|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p335_109.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p335_110.txt|Or was it?
p335_111.txt|It is not fair.
p335_112.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335_113.txt|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p335_114.txt|The dealer is on notice.
p335_115.txt|But it will backfire.
p335_116.txt|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_117.txt|Police were also perplexed.
p335_118.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p335_119.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p335_120.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p335_121.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p335_122.txt|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p335_123.txt|Wagner was never like this.
p335_124.txt|The plane was in flames
p335_125.txt|We represent a wide range of society.
p335_126.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p335_127.txt|I've seen some of the submissions.
p335_128.txt|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p335_129.txt|A win was a real achievement.
p335_130.txt|This is the high point of my career.
p335_131.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p335_132.txt|My duty is to win.
p335_133.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p335_134.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p335_135.txt|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p335_136.txt|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p335_137.txt|I am prepared to help make it happen.
p335_138.txt|This is not presently the case.
p335_139.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p335_140.txt|Don't even bother applying.
p335_141.txt|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p335_142.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p335_143.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p335_144.txt|It's all too short term.
p335_145.txt|It's too big a risk to take.
p335_146.txt|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
p335_147.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p335_148.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p335_149.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p335_150.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p335_151.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p335_152.txt|The elections should have no role in this.
p335_153.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p335_154.txt|Where is the anthrax?
p335_155.txt|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p335_156.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335_157.txt|It's because they can't understand the language.
p335_158.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335_159.txt|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335_160.txt|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p335_161.txt|It's been a good year.
p335_162.txt|We've got the top three.
p335_163.txt|But the price has been very high.
p335_164.txt|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335_165.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p335_166.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p335_167.txt|It's just a normal life.
p335_168.txt|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p335_169.txt|Where is the structure?
p335_170.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335_171.txt|There's still time for that.
p335_172.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p335_173.txt|He is the example for all of us.
p335_174.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p335_175.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p335_176.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p335_177.txt|Teams are always interesting to watch.
p335_178.txt|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p335_179.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p335_180.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p335_181.txt|Our customers come first.
p335_182.txt|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p335_183.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p335_184.txt|We didn't think anything would happen.
p335_185.txt|He had come of age.
p335_186.txt|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p335_187.txt|We do things in an appropriate way.
p335_188.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p335_189.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p335_190.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p335_191.txt|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p335_192.txt|That wasn't for me.
p335_193.txt|I am delighted with today's win.
p335_194.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p335_195.txt|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p335_196.txt|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p335_197.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p335_198.txt|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p335_199.txt|There we were on the first tee.
p335_200.txt|Next time around, it will be different.
p335_201.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p335_202.txt|I looked forward to it.
p335_203.txt|That is a brand name.
p335_204.txt|She was an only child.
p335_205.txt|It is best value.
p335_206.txt|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p335_207.txt|They should come forward.
p335_208.txt|We don't say there was a massacre.
p335_209.txt|That has not changed.
p335_210.txt|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p335_211.txt|The island will never recover.
p335_212.txt|We are not ruling it out.
p335_213.txt|You saw the pain he was in.
p335_214.txt|That is not an easy thing.
p335_215.txt|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p335_216.txt|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p335_217.txt|This doesn't have to be our future.
p335_218.txt|It is a court case.
p335_219.txt|She was a delightful person.
p335_220.txt|They will have to make changes.
p335_221.txt|The next one comes up.
p335_222.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p335_223.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p335_224.txt|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p335_225.txt|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p335_226.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p335_227.txt|This is wonderful news.
p335_228.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p335_229.txt|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p335_230.txt|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p335_231.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p335_232.txt|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335_233.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p335_234.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p335_235.txt|This is a big step up.
p335_236.txt|I don't have any answer for them.
p335_237.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p335_238.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p335_239.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p335_240.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p335_241.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p335_242.txt|You cannot allow it to go on.
p335_243.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p335_244.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p335_245.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p335_246.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p335_247.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p335_248.txt|I am deeply sorry they did.
p335_249.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p335_250.txt|Alex is a big part of that future.
p335_251.txt|Who would have thought it?
p335_252.txt|I think he was surprised.
p335_253.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p335_254.txt|Finally action had been taken.
p335_255.txt|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p335_256.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p335_257.txt|That gives us a bit of a chance.
p335_258.txt|I watched a game.
p335_259.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p335_260.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p335_261.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p335_262.txt|Intensive care has been very busy.
p335_263.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p335_264.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p335_265.txt|This is my home town.
p335_266.txt|I think we've got the balance right.
p335_267.txt|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p335_268.txt|I have good memories of Glasgow.
p335_269.txt|Nothing can bring back their son.
p335_270.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p335_271.txt|Some may end up in hospital.
p335_272.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p335_273.txt|The council has been open and transparent.
p335_274.txt|We can do nothing about that.
p335_275.txt|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p335_276.txt|That is highly unfair.
p335_277.txt|There is great demand for human cloning.
p335_278.txt|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p335_279.txt|Or rather he did and he didn't.
p335_280.txt|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p335_281.txt|Government sources said, It is building up.
p335_282.txt|Arsenal considered the job done.
p335_283.txt|I think it will make a huge difference.
p335_284.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p335_285.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p335_286.txt|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335_287.txt|Others were even less confident.
p335_288.txt|I just want to change my life.
p335_289.txt|On occasions he succeeded.
p335_290.txt|He did not oppose the divorce.
p335_291.txt|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p335_292.txt|There are so many people to thank.
p335_293.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p335_294.txt|He is also a great finisher.
p335_295.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p335_296.txt|I'd never be free.
p335_297.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335_298.txt|A counter reaction was.
p335_299.txt|He said he was sorry.
p335_300.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p335_301.txt|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p335_302.txt|This will help our confidence.
p335_303.txt|This looks like it is anything but open.
p335_304.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p335_305.txt|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p335_306.txt|If not, he should go home.
p335_307.txt|We must not go down that road.
p335_308.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p335_309.txt|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p335_310.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p335_311.txt|Hitches can be expected.
p335_312.txt|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335_313.txt|The issues are very intense.
p335_314.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p335_315.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p335_316.txt|The company's in good shape.
p335_317.txt|Dialogue is the key.
p335_318.txt|The actors are confident and polished.
p335_319.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p335_320.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p335_321.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p335_322.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p335_323.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p335_324.txt|You have to think not.
p335_325.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p335_326.txt|This is a national crisis.
p335_327.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p335_328.txt|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p335_329.txt|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p335_330.txt|The whole thing would be perfect.
p335_331.txt|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335_332.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p335_333.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p335_334.txt|However, we had no failures in our side.
p335_335.txt|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p335_336.txt|We will be stronger in Berlin.
p335_337.txt|It is so damaging.
p335_338.txt|I put pressure on him.
p335_339.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335_340.txt|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p335_341.txt|With us, we just want them to respond.
p335_342.txt|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p335_343.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p335_344.txt|They are the heroes.
p335_345.txt|The songs are just so good.
p335_346.txt|We have rebuilt and reformed.
p335_347.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p335_348.txt|It was certainly intense.
p335_349.txt|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p335_350.txt|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335_351.txt|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
p335_352.txt|We were a shambles at the back.
p335_353.txt|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p335_354.txt|It took more than two years.
p335_355.txt|There is access for disabled people.
p335_356.txt|The home was now under new management.
p335_357.txt|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335_358.txt|Is my wife a racist?
p335_359.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p335_360.txt|There is no openness.
p335_361.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p335_362.txt|It feels like too much.
p335_363.txt|It was a job he loved.
p335_364.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p335_365.txt|But let's not get carried away.
p335_366.txt|There was some merit in that.
p335_367.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p335_368.txt|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p335_369.txt|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p335_370.txt|It looks like paradise.
p335_371.txt|This means a great deal to the families.
p335_372.txt|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p335_373.txt|We were short of athletes.
p335_374.txt|Six other people were injured.
p335_375.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p335_376.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p335_377.txt|Only local people are helping.
p335_378.txt|There were three boys and two girls.
p335_379.txt|There's no support for it at all.
p335_380.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p335_381.txt|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335_382.txt|Writing has diminished in value.
p335_383.txt|There is a job to be done.
p335_384.txt|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p335_385.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p335_386.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p335_387.txt|It's our worst nightmare.
p335_388.txt|I can't believe what has happened.
p335_389.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p335_390.txt|It's really nothing new.
p335_391.txt|You do that because you want to win.
p335_392.txt|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p335_393.txt|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p335_394.txt|Partition is not an option.
p335_395.txt|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p335_396.txt|I'll tell you honestly.
p335_397.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p335_398.txt|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p335_399.txt|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p335_400.txt|The conclusion is enthralling.
p335_401.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p335_402.txt|The review has been conducted fairly.
p335_403.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335_404.txt|Friends of the family have given their support.
p335_405.txt|You name it, they have it.
p335_406.txt|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335_407.txt|There was no cohesion.
p335_408.txt|There is no going back.
p335_409.txt|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p335_410.txt|Courtenay took over on tour.
p335_411.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p335_412.txt|The game is now open.
p335_413.txt|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p335_414.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p335_415.txt|I am in a very difficult position.
p335_416.txt|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p335_417.txt|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p335_418.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p335_419.txt|He is not very big, either.
p335_420.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p335_421.txt|But who gets on the tube?
p335_422.txt|We are encouraged by the news.
p335_423.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p336_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p336_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p336_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p336_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p336_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p336_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p336_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p336_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p336_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p336_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p336_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p336_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p336_025.txt|I am very happy with the result.
p336_026.txt|She took them for a term.
p336_027.txt|It is deeply worrying.
p336_028.txt|This is a very interesting move.
p336_029.txt|Are we not men?
p336_030.txt|How could it not?
p336_031.txt|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_032.txt|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
p336_033.txt|We are proud of them.
p336_034.txt|We had a really good experience with David.
p336_035.txt|It was another good idea.
p336_036.txt|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p336_037.txt|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_038.txt|IT is a terrible equation.
p336_039.txt|That gives us something to kick against.
p336_040.txt|It was pretty special.
p336_041.txt|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
p336_042.txt|I should say so.
p336_043.txt|Yet therein is the problem.
p336_044.txt|This isn't a new problem.
p336_045.txt|That, though, was just the start of it.
p336_046.txt|My office is down there.
p336_047.txt|There can be no dispute about our history.
p336_048.txt|The crowd was waiting.
p336_049.txt|It was a joy.
p336_050.txt|It's the same with cinema.
p336_051.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p336_052.txt|He died from multiple injuries.
p336_053.txt|It is nearly there.
p336_054.txt|I'm going to buy a car.
p336_055.txt|We said, What do you mean?
p336_056.txt|I have been there many times.
p336_057.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_058.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p336_059.txt|They enjoy playing the game.
p336_060.txt|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p336_061.txt|It is not standing army.
p336_062.txt|It was a crucial moment.
p336_063.txt|Someone else has now got them.
p336_064.txt|The second is freedom.
p336_065.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p336_066.txt|Get used to it.
p336_067.txt|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p336_068.txt|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p336_069.txt|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p336_070.txt|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p336_071.txt|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_072.txt|Still, some additions are inspired.
p336_073.txt|Any error is severely punished.
p336_074.txt|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_075.txt|But we will learn from that.
p336_076.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p336_077.txt|We couldn't afford it.
p336_078.txt|I get the bus.
p336_079.txt|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p336_080.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p336_081.txt|The issues are not going to change.
p336_082.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p336_083.txt|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_084.txt|It will be easier for us.
p336_085.txt|I don't think it is.
p336_086.txt|There are no other contenders.
p336_087.txt|On that they agree.
p336_088.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336_089.txt|But who was driving it?
p336_090.txt|We have to get this sorted out.
p336_091.txt|It was very fast.
p336_092.txt|Singing is my first love.
p336_093.txt|When is it ever anything else?
p336_094.txt|It's hard to see it.
p336_095.txt|I believe in trade unions.
p336_096.txt|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p336_097.txt|This is in a league of its own.
p336_098.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p336_099.txt|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p336_100.txt|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_101.txt|That is unlikely to happen.
p336_102.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p336_103.txt|This is not finished.
p336_104.txt|It was one of the firemen.
p336_105.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p336_106.txt|Don't you believe it.
p336_107.txt|There is another important factor.
p336_108.txt|Most people know that.
p336_109.txt|I want to keep playing.
p336_110.txt|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p336_111.txt|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p336_112.txt|That is how we will be judged.
p336_113.txt|It's there for people to look at.
p336_114.txt|We are getting there.
p336_115.txt|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_116.txt|They never got into the show this time.
p336_117.txt|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p336_118.txt|But no, it's not funny.
p336_119.txt|We just try to make great records.
p336_120.txt|It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_121.txt|Why does it come out now?
p336_122.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p336_123.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p336_124.txt|The whole thing was just unreal.
p336_125.txt|They haven't been thought through.
p336_126.txt|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336_127.txt|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
p336_128.txt|The criteria have changed.
p336_129.txt|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_130.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336_131.txt|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336_132.txt|I just have no maternal instincts.
p336_133.txt|It has been declared.
p336_134.txt|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p336_135.txt|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p336_136.txt|It's very hard to plan for it.
p336_137.txt|There is nothing like this back home.
p336_138.txt|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p336_139.txt|He is that good.
p336_140.txt|We did not have a clue.
p336_141.txt|We need to be more specific.
p336_142.txt|This is the man who provides the hope.
p336_143.txt|This is a war over our home.
p336_144.txt|He's got me very well.
p336_145.txt|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336_146.txt|He was always nice to me.
p336_147.txt|He looked at me before replying.
p336_148.txt|Then there is the Mini itself.
p336_149.txt|This may be perfectly innocent.
p336_150.txt|It's good for the city.
p336_151.txt|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_152.txt|Controllers major concern is safety.
p336_153.txt|It's like an extension of your body.
p336_154.txt|Because he usually is.
p336_155.txt|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p336_156.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p336_157.txt|I want my audience to be challenged.
p336_158.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p336_159.txt|Who do you think you are?
p336_160.txt|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336_161.txt|I have no battle with the Scots.
p336_162.txt|I hope he gets it.
p336_163.txt|Everything has its place and purpose.
p336_164.txt|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p336_165.txt|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336_166.txt|Nobody could survive on that.
p336_167.txt|I can't do anything before nine.
p336_168.txt|Their vision was not impeded.
p336_169.txt|He is married with three children.
p336_170.txt|These days will be back.
p336_171.txt|However, they should not come as a surprise.
p336_172.txt|It could last five months.
p336_173.txt|Everything is accounted for.
p336_174.txt|The support from the general public was astounding.
p336_175.txt|About time too, you might think.
p336_176.txt|However, it does not tell the full story.
p336_177.txt|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_178.txt|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_179.txt|We've got a mixture of both.
p336_180.txt|I'm very happy to be here.
p336_181.txt|This is not the case.
p336_182.txt|This one was supposed to be so different.
p336_183.txt|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p336_184.txt|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
p336_185.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p336_186.txt|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p336_187.txt|Cloning is not ready.
p336_188.txt|New Labour are running scared.
p336_189.txt|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p336_190.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p336_191.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p336_192.txt|Don't hold your breath!
p336_193.txt|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p336_194.txt|Where do you think she is going?
p336_195.txt|Safety is our first concern.
p336_196.txt|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p336_197.txt|Inspections are not the problem.
p336_198.txt|But who will buy it?
p336_199.txt|And it's more subversive.
p336_200.txt|Openness is always the best way.
p336_201.txt|It wouldn't go off.
p336_202.txt|I've been enjoying it, though.
p336_203.txt|The professor said the results were positive.
p336_204.txt|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336_205.txt|It's part of the end game.
p336_206.txt|Do they play for the money?
p336_207.txt|The train was on time.
p336_208.txt|So, where do we go from here?
p336_209.txt|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_210.txt|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
p336_211.txt|And how much of a compliment is that?
p336_213.txt|Politics is a tough game.
p336_214.txt|I have friends in Glasgow.
p336_215.txt|What has changed?
p336_216.txt|There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_217.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p336_218.txt|We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_219.txt|I'm not interested in the job.
p336_220.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p336_221.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p336_222.txt|The warnings were a good reminder.
p336_223.txt|I came here this week to work.
p336_224.txt|It's the last thing on my mind.
p336_225.txt|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p336_226.txt|The biggest resource is our staff.
p336_227.txt|We have big ideas.
p336_228.txt|How will we get there?
p336_229.txt|She told me to stop.
p336_230.txt|I wish him well for the future.
p336_231.txt|Cars are great for going long distances.
p336_232.txt|It's not a party, no, no.
p336_233.txt|The lads are having a tour.
p336_234.txt|It may not be life long.
p336_235.txt|Everyone was in tears.
p336_236.txt|It was just above the roof.
p336_237.txt|These were the dreams.
p336_238.txt|But we must work in harmony.
p336_239.txt|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p336_240.txt|There is no other way.
p336_241.txt|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p336_242.txt|The English are coming.
p336_243.txt|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p336_244.txt|I believe in theatre.
p336_245.txt|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336_246.txt|It's time to say enough is enough.
p336_247.txt|He has to pull back from the brink.
p336_248.txt|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336_249.txt|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_250.txt|That does not mean we have failed.
p336_251.txt|The family baton is handed on.
p336_252.txt|She has a little boy.
p336_253.txt|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336_254.txt|He has refused to do that.
p336_255.txt|I can understand why they have gone.
p336_256.txt|All my training is for Athens.
p336_257.txt|This is a personal decision for me.
p336_258.txt|When will you listen?
p336_259.txt|I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_260.txt|All of them were killed.
p336_261.txt|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p336_262.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p336_263.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p336_264.txt|Ferguson must take the blame.
p336_265.txt|There is no point in denying that.
p336_266.txt|The kids are paying the price.
p336_267.txt|Not that it is unique.
p336_268.txt|We're all going to take a holiday.
p336_269.txt|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p336_270.txt|Some injustice was committed.
p336_271.txt|I've had a wonderful career.
p336_272.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p336_273.txt|I didn't expect to be in.
p336_274.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p336_275.txt|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_276.txt|I should think so, too.
p336_277.txt|If so, we want to hear from them.
p336_278.txt|It's not covered by the insurance.
p336_279.txt|He denied the charge.
p336_280.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p336_281.txt|There is no easy answer.
p336_282.txt|I watch the other visitors.
p336_283.txt|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p336_284.txt|I am not a liar.
p336_285.txt|The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_286.txt|He had no problem with alcohol.
p336_287.txt|I had no experience at all.
p336_288.txt|Yet he remains confident enough.
p336_289.txt|It has become very confused.
p336_290.txt|Fame and money followed.
p336_291.txt|It's a national sport.
p336_292.txt|I just made it.
p336_293.txt|There was no secrecy.
p336_294.txt|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336_295.txt|Even then it might be difficult.
p336_296.txt|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336_297.txt|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336_299.txt|Relief was beyond belief.
p336_300.txt|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_301.txt|It was complete nonsense.
p336_302.txt|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p336_303.txt|It is three years.
p336_304.txt|They are not always the same person.
p336_305.txt|We meet again in Berlin.
p336_306.txt|This is a very special moment for me.
p336_307.txt|It is a daunting task.
p336_308.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p336_309.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p336_310.txt|That was me today.
p336_311.txt|That is when we are really effective.
p336_312.txt|They just would not have run away.
p336_313.txt|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336_314.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p336_315.txt|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_316.txt|This is an appealing record.
p336_317.txt|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_318.txt|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_319.txt|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_320.txt|Yes, it was uplifting.
p336_321.txt|Nobody should believe this story.
p336_322.txt|No person has been charged.
p336_323.txt|One paper was not returned.
p336_324.txt|I don't want to do too much.
p336_325.txt|We don't have money to get to town.
p336_326.txt|We have great support.
p336_327.txt|One would not want to go there anyway.
p336_328.txt|And it's difficult to argue.
p336_329.txt|We'll see what happens.
p336_330.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p336_331.txt|That's not part of the deal.
p336_332.txt|There is a problem.
p336_333.txt|He pretended not to care.
p336_334.txt|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
p336_335.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p336_336.txt|Was it too obvious?
p336_337.txt|Wouldn't it be nice?
p336_338.txt|I was in tears in the street.
p336_339.txt|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p336_340.txt|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_343.txt|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_344.txt|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p336_345.txt|That is why we are here.
p336_346.txt|He wouldn't do it.
p336_347.txt|She becomes a mother.
p336_348.txt|He is very much respected within the group.
p336_349.txt|People want to learn.
p336_350.txt|Bomber was not amused.
p336_351.txt|I am not a happy man.
p336_352.txt|But it was fun.
p336_353.txt|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p336_354.txt|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p336_355.txt|It's been such a waste of money.
p336_356.txt|Not so, it transpires.
p336_357.txt|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p336_358.txt|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
p336_359.txt|I'd like to run.
p336_360.txt|Its future is no longer in question.
p336_361.txt|But this relative success has not been easy.
p336_362.txt|I am a player.
p336_363.txt|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p336_364.txt|He was not alone.
p336_365.txt|There was too much at stake.
p336_366.txt|Who wouldn't do it?
p336_368.txt|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p336_369.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p336_370.txt|We are all in the frontline.
p336_371.txt|It looked like a war zone.
p336_372.txt|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336_373.txt|Further expansion is possible.
p336_374.txt|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336_375.txt|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_376.txt|At this point we can only speculate.
p336_377.txt|We know we have the quality.
p336_378.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p336_379.txt|It may be the first of many.
p336_380.txt|It runs in cycles.
p336_381.txt|It is already making a difference.
p336_382.txt|I spoke to him yesterday.
p336_383.txt|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_384.txt|This is the stuff of live music.
p336_385.txt|We were beaten by the better team today.
p336_386.txt|Taxes may need to rise.
p336_387.txt|It's unusual to say the least.
p336_388.txt|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336_389.txt|I am not going to sit back.
p336_390.txt|But this is even worse.
p336_391.txt|It left me with a sadness.
p336_392.txt|I was living with my mum.
p336_393.txt|The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_394.txt|There were few surprises.
p336_395.txt|He is a one-off.
p336_396.txt|And then he laughs.
p336_397.txt|She is having an affair with his partner.
p336_398.txt|He put a lot of effort into it.
p336_399.txt|The pressure is enormous.
p336_400.txt|I am not that sadistic.
p336_401.txt|Are you all right?
p336_402.txt|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p336_403.txt|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336_404.txt|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336_405.txt|Is it any good?
p336_406.txt|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336_407.txt|It would be that absurd.
p336_408.txt|As if he would.
p336_409.txt|I just carry on with my work.
p336_410.txt|She made no further comment.
p336_411.txt|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336_412.txt|He wants the festival to make a difference.
p336_413.txt|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p336_415.txt|The auction has seven days to run.
p336_416.txt|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_417.txt|They want to prove a point.
p336_418.txt|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_419.txt|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_420.txt|What is going on?
p336_421.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p336_422.txt|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_423.txt|Tonight is very special.
p336_424.txt|This is a matter of life and death.
p339_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p339_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_018.txt|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p339_025.txt|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_026.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_027.txt|Glasgow is far from overload.
p339_028.txt|It's a big mystery.
p339_029.txt|What is a house without it?
p339_030.txt|It was really good in the first week.
p339_031.txt|It's about the balance.
p339_032.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339_033.txt|It really has not been their season.
p339_034.txt|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_035.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_036.txt|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_037.txt|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_038.txt|You go in there and do it.
p339_039.txt|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339_040.txt|What will happen to them today?
p339_041.txt|I didn't expect to get one.
p339_042.txt|It was electric, amazing.
p339_043.txt|I said to him.
p339_044.txt|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045.txt|he told a producer.
p339_046.txt|That is not the place for her.
p339_047.txt|The jury is still out on this one.
p339_048.txt|We have to work together.
p339_049.txt|I don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050.txt|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p339_051.txt|It means it is difficult.
p339_052.txt|But they were true stories.
p339_053.txt|I needed to get away.
p339_054.txt|I will make that point tonight.
p339_055.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056.txt|There are two things we have to do.
p339_057.txt|Are they going to work together again?
p339_058.txt|We need to do that every week.
p339_059.txt|It gives us something to work on.
p339_060.txt|But what did it matter?
p339_061.txt|A government is a government is a government.
p339_062.txt|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063.txt|I am not retaining him.
p339_064.txt|The police are not the target.
p339_065.txt|It has affected it, obviously.
p339_066.txt|But that title is a mistake.
p339_067.txt|And he's not a bigot.
p339_068.txt|But summer is spent.
p339_069.txt|Services are being expanded, too.
p339_070.txt|It has only been rumours.
p339_071.txt|It is extremely fortunate.
p339_072.txt|Today is the first step in that process.
p339_073.txt|Several others were absent.
p339_074.txt|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075.txt|But there was no time for that.
p339_076.txt|A review is under way.
p339_077.txt|That should be fun.
p339_078.txt|Maybe he will act again.
p339_079.txt|What we were doing.
p339_080.txt|What is the Barnett formula?
p339_081.txt|It all happened so suddenly.
p339_082.txt|I won't let that happen.
p339_083.txt|Or have they?
p339_084.txt|There is no change in the strategy.
p339_085.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p339_086.txt|It will probably be my last, too.
p339_087.txt|I am not completely insane.
p339_088.txt|We spoke about a few people.
p339_089.txt|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_090.txt|In fact, he took it very well.
p339_091.txt|I decided to take my time.
p339_092.txt|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339_093.txt|We did it in one take.
p339_094.txt|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_095.txt|It is hard to understand.
p339_096.txt|What will it be?
p339_097.txt|The search is due to be completed today.
p339_098.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_099.txt|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339_100.txt|He is a one-off.
p339_101.txt|Six men will take the decision.
p339_102.txt|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_103.txt|We should not be surprised at that.
p339_104.txt|It was a disaster.
p339_105.txt|We have been so lucky.
p339_107.txt|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_108.txt|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_109.txt|It was all over now.
p339_110.txt|But it was only a matter of time.
p339_111.txt|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_112.txt|I still hope to go.
p339_113.txt|Sometimes they come off.
p339_114.txt|We're not that bad.
p339_115.txt|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_116.txt|I feel strongly about it.
p339_117.txt|There are exciting days ahead.
p339_118.txt|We have to put this behind us.
p339_119.txt|I thought it was quite good.
p339_120.txt|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_121.txt|We're very, very happy.
p339_122.txt|There could be a possible connection.
p339_123.txt|But there was everything!
p339_124.txt|We are doing very well as we are.
p339_125.txt|The Scots are great.
p339_126.txt|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_127.txt|However, the drama was not over.
p339_128.txt|But it was not just the land.
p339_129.txt|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_130.txt|It is too much for me.
p339_131.txt|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_132.txt|We are still waiting.
p339_133.txt|It happened again yesterday.
p339_134.txt|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_135.txt|That question was never asked.
p339_136.txt|I am not inclined to believe it.
p339_137.txt|It was on fire.
p339_138.txt|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_139.txt|How can they tell?
p339_140.txt|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_141.txt|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_142.txt|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_143.txt|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339_144.txt|He was part of the family.
p339_145.txt|I certainly think it should be there.
p339_146.txt|But it does not matter.
p339_147.txt|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_148.txt|Sadly, he has a point.
p339_149.txt|It was so sad.
p339_150.txt|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339_151.txt|We were extremely lucky.
p339_152.txt|It was an amazing time.
p339_153.txt|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339_154.txt|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_155.txt|It is just a matter of time.
p339_156.txt|This news is really depressing.
p339_157.txt|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_158.txt|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339_159.txt|The enemy was time.
p339_160.txt|He would have done the same to me.
p339_161.txt|What were they told?
p339_162.txt|More cases are expected.
p339_163.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_164.txt|It would be very dangerous.
p339_165.txt|How can they say that?
p339_166.txt|My condition is not bad.
p339_167.txt|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_168.txt|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339_169.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_170.txt|The goal is clear.
p339_171.txt|Just think about the lines.
p339_172.txt|It all depends on the wind.
p339_173.txt|I was very influenced by him.
p339_174.txt|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_175.txt|This was much worse.
p339_176.txt|This was certainly not about money.
p339_177.txt|It is simple, but profound.
p339_178.txt|The funding is now there.
p339_179.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_180.txt|A film is different from a book.
p339_181.txt|Within three days he was dead.
p339_182.txt|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_183.txt|Did they give any good advice?
p339_184.txt|We know that from recent experience.
p339_185.txt|From day one, we were a family.
p339_186.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p339_187.txt|This could be wonderful.
p339_188.txt|He loved it, and so did they.
p339_189.txt|The other was a football match.
p339_190.txt|They have the players to do it.
p339_191.txt|Which is worse?
p339_192.txt|He has made a step forward.
p339_193.txt|That was very important.
p339_194.txt|This will have to change.
p339_195.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p339_196.txt|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_197.txt|We are going to have a party.
p339_198.txt|I have no problem with that.
p339_199.txt|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_200.txt|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_201.txt|We're all paying for it.
p339_202.txt|Lester was like that.
p339_203.txt|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339_204.txt|That's a matter for them.
p339_205.txt|We were never told it was already decided.
p339_206.txt|It is part of our heritage.
p339_207.txt|It is not a road of life.
p339_208.txt|It is not as simple as that.
p339_209.txt|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_210.txt|Find them somebody they deserve.
p339_211.txt|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_212.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339_213.txt|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_214.txt|We're not getting involved.
p339_215.txt|The lottery has helped.
p339_216.txt|They know the language.
p339_217.txt|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_218.txt|We shall be victorious.
p339_219.txt|The quality of work is very impressive.
p339_220.txt|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339_221.txt|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_222.txt|We will all suffer as a result.
p339_223.txt|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339_224.txt|What's it about?
p339_225.txt|We are looking to the future.
p339_226.txt|The signs are positive.
p339_227.txt|I called it right.
p339_228.txt|I see it as my job.
p339_229.txt|I have always believed in myself.
p339_230.txt|It has to be put in context.
p339_231.txt|I think we can get there.
p339_232.txt|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_233.txt|No, they have played well.
p339_234.txt|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_235.txt|The answer is obviously no.
p339_236.txt|I'll take it as it comes.
p339_237.txt|I think we're the better side.
p339_238.txt|We act because we must.
p339_239.txt|There are two mysteries.
p339_240.txt|The teacher would have approved.
p339_241.txt|Are you going to win?
p339_242.txt|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_243.txt|I could have been killed on that day.
p339_244.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p339_245.txt|It is very enjoyable.
p339_246.txt|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339_247.txt|Did it work?
p339_248.txt|But that is for another day.
p339_249.txt|There is a great carry over value.
p339_250.txt|It was not like that at all.
p339_251.txt|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_252.txt|I was very surprised.
p339_253.txt|We all knew they could do it.
p339_254.txt|It's about taking risks.
p339_255.txt|Why is this?
p339_256.txt|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_257.txt|It was indeed a night to remember.
p339_258.txt|There are not too many like him.
p339_259.txt|The memory is there.
p339_260.txt|It was an amazing experience.
p339_261.txt|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_262.txt|He will go on the bench.
p339_263.txt|The police are hopeless.
p339_264.txt|There are no plans to change this.
p339_265.txt|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_266.txt|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_267.txt|That's the important thing.
p339_268.txt|Should he resign?
p339_269.txt|They have to live with the risk.
p339_270.txt|It is, but that's not the point.
p339_271.txt|It was my whole life.
p339_272.txt|It was a classic.
p339_273.txt|This week is a perfect example.
p339_274.txt|However, it is going to happen.
p339_275.txt|This time it really could happen.
p339_276.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_277.txt|That includes the equipment?
p339_278.txt|It does nothing for me.
p339_279.txt|That has been lost.
p339_280.txt|But that's another story.
p339_281.txt|I think it has worked.
p339_282.txt|No other family members could be contacted.
p339_283.txt|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_284.txt|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_285.txt|But do not rely on it.
p339_286.txt|I made a mistake.
p339_287.txt|What do you want.
p339_288.txt|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_289.txt|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_290.txt|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339_291.txt|Was that not awful?
p339_292.txt|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_293.txt|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_294.txt|But it will not work again.
p339_295.txt|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_296.txt|I have nothing to say on that.
p339_297.txt|The rest is his own.
p339_298.txt|I have no worry about that.
p339_299.txt|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339_300.txt|Who was on the panel?
p339_301.txt|It turned out to have been three hours.
p339_302.txt|That is exactly right.
p339_303.txt|That is not good for golf!
p339_304.txt|He had planned to sell it.
p339_305.txt|We know the goals will come.
p339_306.txt|But it did not last.
p339_307.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p339_308.txt|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339_309.txt|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_310.txt|We have nothing to lose.
p339_311.txt|The first time it was rejected.
p339_312.txt|He did not report it.
p339_313.txt|No-one can take it in.
p339_314.txt|They were following his orders.
p339_315.txt|That is an entirely different discipline.
p339_316.txt|It was an insult.
p339_317.txt|Yet there is hope.
p339_318.txt|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_319.txt|It will not be easy for him.
p339_320.txt|That was a fairy tale.
p339_321.txt|I would love to do that.
p339_322.txt|You'll have to wait and see.
p339_323.txt|It wasn't the issue.
p339_324.txt|The number never came.
p339_325.txt|I really have to go now.
p339_326.txt|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_327.txt|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339_328.txt|Words are not enough.
p339_329.txt|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_330.txt|We have expected it.
p339_331.txt|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339_332.txt|Well, that was the plan.
p339_333.txt|The problem is fairly serious.
p339_334.txt|No decisions have been taken.
p339_335.txt|We won't do that.
p339_336.txt|It's the body that counts.
p339_337.txt|Sprinters are not fit.
p339_338.txt|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_339.txt|It's a double whammy.
p339_340.txt|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_341.txt|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_342.txt|That's why he is the prime minister.
p339_343.txt|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_344.txt|They have to be dealt with.
p339_345.txt|His manager blamed the referee.
p339_346.txt|So what was he really doing?
p339_347.txt|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_348.txt|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_349.txt|We're very close to being a good team.
p339_350.txt|I thought their commitment was superb.
p339_351.txt|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_352.txt|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_353.txt|I had nothing to lose.
p339_354.txt|This is a really serious issue.
p339_355.txt|I thought to myself.
p339_356.txt|Could it be?
p339_357.txt|We're talking to the US.
p339_358.txt|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_359.txt|It looks as though there is no chance.
p339_360.txt|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_361.txt|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_362.txt|I cannot really commit.
p339_363.txt|There are many questions to be answered.
p339_364.txt|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339_365.txt|This is a new beginning.
p339_366.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339_367.txt|They will fight for everything.
p339_368.txt|He is doing just that.
p339_369.txt|The night is young.
p339_370.txt|But there are signs of a revival.
p339_371.txt|I thought it was a great game.
p339_372.txt|Just get on with it.
p339_373.txt|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_374.txt|It shows the Government is listening.
p339_375.txt|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_376.txt|They want it to work.
p339_377.txt|This is a completely new experience for me.
p339_378.txt|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_379.txt|It decided to blame the media.
p339_380.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p339_381.txt|He was at the outset of his career.
p339_382.txt|Our position is quite clear.
p339_383.txt|It could now be up to the courts.
p339_384.txt|We can make a difference.
p339_385.txt|This was not a contest.
p339_386.txt|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_387.txt|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_388.txt|I cannot describe it.
p339_389.txt|It is not designed to kill.
p339_390.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p339_391.txt|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_392.txt|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_393.txt|It is good football in Scotland.
p339_394.txt|There is no other option.
p339_395.txt|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_396.txt|It is a technique.
p339_397.txt|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_398.txt|My body is exhausted.
p339_399.txt|It is about more than Scotland.
p339_400.txt|It's not just going to be busy.
p339_401.txt|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_402.txt|The first appeared to be successful.
p339_403.txt|She was so supportive.
p339_404.txt|I'm delighted with our performance.
p339_405.txt|We await a decision.
p339_406.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p339_407.txt|It is an investment in our product.
p339_408.txt|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_409.txt|What would you ask?
p339_410.txt|We have got to deal with it.
p339_411.txt|Where do we spend it?
p339_412.txt|I don't know how she does it.
p339_413.txt|I saw it later in the news.
p339_414.txt|Now we must look to the future.
p339_415.txt|I didn't play badly.
p339_416.txt|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_417.txt|They are looking for partners.
p339_418.txt|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_419.txt|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_420.txt|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_421.txt|He did very well, but didn't win.
p339_422.txt|There is no shortage of questions.
p339_423.txt|Couldn't see the point.
p339_424.txt|Which, in effect, it is.
p340_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p340_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p340_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p340_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p340_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p340_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p340_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p340_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340_017.txt|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p340_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p340_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p340_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p340_025.txt|It would be nice.
p340_026.txt|We are not prepared to do that.
p340_027.txt|We've just decided to do something about it.
p340_028.txt|It's a horrific incident.
p340_029.txt|But it's not just about that.
p340_030.txt|We've not won anything yet.
p340_031.txt|He was very close.
p340_032.txt|But someone has to take them.
p340_033.txt|We don't find any danger from them.
p340_034.txt|Do you think they would do any better?
p340_035.txt|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p340_036.txt|Who was that?
p340_037.txt|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p340_038.txt|This is my personal assessment.
p340_039.txt|It is a recipe for success.
p340_040.txt|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p340_041.txt|We didn't deserve to win.
p340_042.txt|This is great news.
p340_043.txt|We can hardly talk about it.
p340_044.txt|That was a month ago.
p340_045.txt|I have lost all confidence.
p340_046.txt|It would be another reason to live.
p340_047.txt|I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_048.txt|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_049.txt|It is somewhere to be.
p340_050.txt|But it was no problem.
p340_051.txt|This has been a difficult time for me.
p340_052.txt|These people are not big names.
p340_053.txt|Don't you believe it.
p340_054.txt|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p340_055.txt|We did something about it.
p340_056.txt|Where is the money coming from?
p340_057.txt|It needs a rethink.
p340_058.txt|Why does it work?
p340_059.txt|He would have been wrong.
p340_060.txt|He played really, really well.
p340_061.txt|He was right of course.
p340_062.txt|It's there for people to look at.
p340_063.txt|Together, we can make a difference.
p340_064.txt|That, however, was the exception.
p340_065.txt|This has been a long process.
p340_066.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p340_067.txt|It's probably just as well.
p340_068.txt|It is time for the talking to stop.
p340_069.txt|We were very close.
p340_070.txt|If only it were so.
p340_071.txt|They do not deliver.
p340_072.txt|However, that is just for starters.
p340_073.txt|This can be extreme.
p340_074.txt|I'm sure that they will learn.
p340_075.txt|Would she remember the music?
p340_076.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p340_077.txt|Two options are being proposed.
p340_078.txt|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_079.txt|He is now back in Britain.
p340_080.txt|There was no commission.
p340_081.txt|There was a vacuum.
p340_082.txt|It is time to be realistic.
p340_083.txt|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_084.txt|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p340_085.txt|It is a potential danger.
p340_086.txt|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p340_087.txt|But we never wanted to do that here.
p340_088.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p340_089.txt|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_090.txt|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
p340_091.txt|It could be to do with the location.
p340_092.txt|This is a terrible tragedy.
p340_093.txt|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p340_094.txt|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_095.txt|He said he never saw it.
p340_096.txt|It is a matter of clarity.
p340_097.txt|You will never get a conviction.
p340_098.txt|He did not have to stop and think.
p340_099.txt|We deserved to win it.
p340_100.txt|Or did it?
p340_101.txt|It's just not funny!
p340_102.txt|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_103.txt|He almost admitted as much.
p340_104.txt|So what is the problem?
p340_105.txt|We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_106.txt|He didn't bother a soul.
p340_107.txt|That was my first reaction.
p340_108.txt|Fishing is a declining industry.
p340_109.txt|Another man said, It was horrible.
p340_110.txt|That's the way it goes.
p340_111.txt|But we still don't know.
p340_112.txt|Are there any he wants to play?
p340_113.txt|The film is on a tightrope.
p340_114.txt|It was a question of patience.
p340_115.txt|I have never been in anything like that.
p340_116.txt|I have done ever since it was published.
p340_117.txt|We have got to the top.
p340_118.txt|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p340_119.txt|And it worked, so we kept it.
p340_120.txt|The king is delighted by the honour.
p340_121.txt|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p340_122.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p340_123.txt|Yes, we can beat them.
p340_124.txt|She was not hard done by.
p340_125.txt|They said they were only young men.
p340_126.txt|We are in the end game.
p340_127.txt|This is not the case.
p340_128.txt|There may be some resistance.
p340_129.txt|It is the same old story.
p340_130.txt|You need that freedom in society.
p340_131.txt|It is a strong case.
p340_132.txt|Who do you think will win?
p340_133.txt|I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_134.txt|That was one very hard game.
p340_135.txt|He said something in his work.
p340_136.txt|I recommend a tour.
p340_137.txt|This research is extremely promising.
p340_138.txt|I was invited to work in Germany.
p340_139.txt|Weather conditions were good, he added.
p340_140.txt|Don't hold your breath.
p340_141.txt|He was shaking like a leaf.
p340_142.txt|I have a moral dilemma.
p340_143.txt|It looks like a hit.
p340_144.txt|How did he know?
p340_145.txt|He will have to live with his words.
p340_146.txt|Openness is always the best way.
p340_147.txt|It added to the spectacle.
p340_148.txt|They are working very well.
p340_149.txt|And he listens to his artists as well.
p340_150.txt|He is advised that he has done so.
p340_151.txt|Annika is very, very fit.
p340_152.txt|This is not quite right.
p340_153.txt|It really is tremendous.
p340_154.txt|I've never regretted my decision.
p340_155.txt|This is a recipe for disaster.
p340_156.txt|The wind was coming from all directions.
p340_157.txt|So we started building a home.
p340_158.txt|He was as good as his word.
p340_159.txt|It will not happen overnight.
p340_160.txt|Surely it can't get any worse.
p340_161.txt|He has to learn.
p340_162.txt|He, too, will return.
p340_163.txt|What then is wrong?
p340_164.txt|My brother is not like that.
p340_165.txt|He was very fit.
p340_166.txt|It was very exciting.
p340_167.txt|It is clear that change is required.
p340_168.txt|They did a very good job.
p340_169.txt|It has been a waste of time.
p340_170.txt|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
p340_171.txt|He had no previous convictions.
p340_172.txt|It is no more than a shell.
p340_173.txt|And did they have sex?
p340_174.txt|But he was a really nice man.
p340_175.txt|It was very close.
p340_176.txt|It should be scrapped.
p340_177.txt|It gives us hope.
p340_178.txt|We can't determine that clearly.
p340_179.txt|They are just trying to cover up.
p340_180.txt|Are you the man from The Herald?
p340_181.txt|And that's it?
p340_182.txt|I came here this week to work.
p340_183.txt|We are really good friends.
p340_184.txt|But that is not an issue for now.
p340_185.txt|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_186.txt|I want to be frank.
p340_187.txt|This was an option from the beginning.
p340_188.txt|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340_189.txt|Yet it seemed to work.
p340_190.txt|I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_191.txt|We haven't been able to go and see.
p340_192.txt|It works, as well.
p340_193.txt|I can't say anything.
p340_194.txt|I would be interested in another attempt.
p340_195.txt|However, that is a sizeable if.
p340_196.txt|There is no other way.
p340_197.txt|This was all well and good.
p340_198.txt|This is a disaster for us.
p340_199.txt|What does that mean?
p340_200.txt|This is your life.
p340_201.txt|He has seen the past.
p340_202.txt|He can be beaten.
p340_203.txt|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_204.txt|Why does he do it?
p340_205.txt|That's my daughter acting.
p340_206.txt|They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_207.txt|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p340_208.txt|We lost out a little bit.
p340_209.txt|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340_210.txt|I had just taken it off.
p340_211.txt|The family baton is handed on.
p340_212.txt|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p340_213.txt|It was properly reported to us.
p340_214.txt|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340_215.txt|The seller was not revealed.
p340_216.txt|Everything happened so quickly.
p340_217.txt|How can this be?
p340_218.txt|I am feeling a bit better.
p340_219.txt|Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_220.txt|Not so, it seems.
p340_221.txt|He was also a great man.
p340_222.txt|We have no further comment to make.
p340_223.txt|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_224.txt|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340_225.txt|You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_226.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p340_227.txt|So there, we won.
p340_228.txt|I don't like to fail.
p340_229.txt|I really didn't think he would.
p340_230.txt|He may have a long wait.
p340_231.txt|They have already done that.
p340_232.txt|Later, a very different story emerged.
p340_233.txt|So it should be.
p340_234.txt|They didn't find any substance.
p340_235.txt|It's hard to say.
p340_236.txt|Her heart was not in it.
p340_237.txt|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p340_238.txt|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p340_239.txt|They are now collapsing.
p340_240.txt|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_241.txt|Government funding is not a problem.
p340_242.txt|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340_243.txt|We just did not want to believe it.
p340_244.txt|The medal itself is not that important.
p340_245.txt|I should think so, too.
p340_246.txt|The time for change is now.
p340_247.txt|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340_248.txt|Can they be serious?
p340_249.txt|We've got to get this right.
p340_250.txt|The film was great.
p340_251.txt|I'm just enjoying every match.
p340_252.txt|They set up to win the hole.
p340_253.txt|I am not a liar.
p340_254.txt|Let's make this clear.
p340_255.txt|We also hope to meet the men.
p340_256.txt|It was quite simply, delicious.
p340_257.txt|I can't believe it happened.
p340_258.txt|Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_259.txt|The game will be at a football stadium.
p340_260.txt|They were his words.
p340_261.txt|Shelter also supports the reform.
p340_262.txt|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p340_263.txt|People were very confused.
p340_264.txt|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_265.txt|I am very relieved.
p340_266.txt|The people have been really friendly.
p340_267.txt|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p340_268.txt|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_269.txt|That, though, is not true.
p340_270.txt|I hope he comes back.
p340_271.txt|They made up for it on Saturday.
p340_272.txt|That was our mission.
p340_273.txt|I am delighted for them.
p340_274.txt|The second half was a different affair.
p340_275.txt|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p340_276.txt|They might be surprised by the response.
p340_277.txt|I've done it all.
p340_278.txt|We have worked well with them for years.
p340_279.txt|They've had a good start as well.
p340_280.txt|The director's a genius.
p340_281.txt|One thing is clear.
p340_282.txt|We might never see him again.
p340_283.txt|Such as it is.
p340_284.txt|The car was just there.
p340_285.txt|They were very unfair to him.
p340_286.txt|I have spoken to my brother.
p340_287.txt|And that is very good indeed.
p340_288.txt|We could have had no new money.
p340_289.txt|It wasn't an easy decision.
p340_290.txt|It wasn't really like that at all.
p340_291.txt|What will happen to them now?
p340_292.txt|It is set in Paris.
p340_293.txt|The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340_294.txt|We are not collecting.
p340_295.txt|It shows the right amount of progress.
p340_296.txt|I thought the dancing was over.
p340_297.txt|I think they have got it completely right.
p340_298.txt|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p340_299.txt|He's already made history.
p340_300.txt|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p340_301.txt|There is a lot of fear.
p340_302.txt|They are not left wing.
p340_303.txt|I've heard it all before.
p340_304.txt|We are not there yet.
p340_305.txt|We will not give up on the truth.
p340_306.txt|Sub Not Used, McCall.
p340_307.txt|Now they had it.
p340_308.txt|She died a few days later.
p340_309.txt|What is their concern?
p340_310.txt|The difference was amazing.
p340_311.txt|That is why we are here.
p340_312.txt|But it is historic.
p340_313.txt|You have to feel for the guy.
p340_314.txt|I have still to hear about that.
p340_315.txt|I'm going to win the next two.
p340_316.txt|You know it was good fun.
p340_317.txt|They want that school.
p340_318.txt|They have not changed at all.
p340_319.txt|One is investment, one is reform.
p340_320.txt|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_321.txt|Structural changes will never be enough.
p340_322.txt|I am extremely cautious.
p340_323.txt|That was always the danger.
p340_324.txt|Will they fall in love?
p340_325.txt|There was nothing sinister in that.
p340_326.txt|But don't just take my word for it.
p340_327.txt|Is that what it's about?
p340_328.txt|And the audience is a surprise.
p340_329.txt|They worked on it for three hours.
p340_330.txt|Let's make him a show.
p340_331.txt|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_332.txt|People are using it in their daily lives.
p340_333.txt|It seemed so personal.
p340_334.txt|Would that be for men and women?
p340_335.txt|The government agreed to pay.
p340_336.txt|I think we have got the balance right.
p340_337.txt|It was a very terrible thing.
p340_338.txt|Let's not take too much for granted.
p340_339.txt|It has been an extremely long haul.
p340_340.txt|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_341.txt|She is deeply distressed.
p340_342.txt|They should have listened to me.
p340_343.txt|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
p340_344.txt|They said they would.
p340_345.txt|When will this change?
p340_346.txt|You know the score.
p340_347.txt|It was like someone had died.
p340_348.txt|I am an innocent man.
p340_349.txt|The improvement today was fantastic.
p340_350.txt|He has been under great pressure.
p340_351.txt|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_352.txt|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_353.txt|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p340_354.txt|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_355.txt|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p340_356.txt|But he did not appear.
p340_357.txt|So he was anxious to try something new.
p340_358.txt|The time was right.
p340_359.txt|It all happened so quickly.
p340_360.txt|It is working well.
p340_361.txt|They really want to do it.
p340_362.txt|He said nothing of the sort.
p340_363.txt|Governments will have to respond.
p340_364.txt|It simply doesn't happen.
p340_365.txt|We wanted to do something different.
p340_366.txt|The past is history, not destiny.
p340_367.txt|I love it here.
p340_368.txt|Things are on track.
p340_369.txt|Frankly it was disgusting.
p340_370.txt|It is a tragedy for the area.
p340_371.txt|He was not entirely correct.
p340_372.txt|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_373.txt|War is not the action.
p340_374.txt|There are not enough of them.
p340_375.txt|It has been a frustrating one.
p340_376.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p340_377.txt|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_378.txt|What's in a name?
p340_379.txt|It feels like a winner already.
p340_380.txt|They are expected to be released today.
p340_381.txt|There was no question of him not impressing.
p340_382.txt|We were all afraid.
p340_383.txt|I hadn't had that before.
p340_384.txt|We have a plan in place.
p340_385.txt|That is to miss the point.
p340_386.txt|It will be a new experience.
p340_387.txt|I didn't see it.
p340_388.txt|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340_389.txt|IT had to happen.
p340_390.txt|It is a challenge for all of us.
p340_391.txt|The children are fine.
p340_392.txt|I don't believe in God.
p340_393.txt|There's also the point.
p340_394.txt|It's good to be back.
p340_395.txt|It wasn't the second one.
p340_396.txt|He got his degree.
p340_397.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p340_398.txt|Detectives are still working on the case.
p340_399.txt|I reported it but nothing was done.
p340_400.txt|They were not defeated.
p340_401.txt|There was much to be positive about.
p340_402.txt|It wants them to go home.
p340_403.txt|I had a ball today.
p340_404.txt|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340_405.txt|He said no survivors had been found.
p340_406.txt|It is the end of an era.
p340_407.txt|We shall not do that.
p340_408.txt|My daughter was really, really innocent.
p340_409.txt|It will not be easy.
p340_410.txt|Once again, he refused.
p340_411.txt|And it will be a challenge.
p340_412.txt|And Scotland is no different.
p340_413.txt|The power of religion is so strong.
p340_414.txt|It means a huge amount.
p340_415.txt|There are two interests in this woodland.
p340_416.txt|I was frustrated here.
p340_417.txt|It is a good result.
p340_418.txt|Are you watching Liverpool?
p340_419.txt|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p340_420.txt|It was one New Year.
p340_421.txt|We made a world record together.
p340_422.txt|Our policy is already working well.
p340_423.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p340_424.txt|Things were not easy from the outset.
p341_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p341_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p341_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p341_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p341_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p341_025.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p341_026.txt|That's interesting to me.
p341_027.txt|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_028.txt|It is only one night, after all.
p341_029.txt|The injuries are not too serious.
p341_030.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p341_031.txt|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_032.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p341_033.txt|Everything was up for grabs.
p341_034.txt|It's easy to see why.
p341_035.txt|I am proud of moments like that.
p341_036.txt|That was no surprise to me.
p341_037.txt|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_038.txt|There is no escape.
p341_039.txt|It's wonderful to have won.
p341_040.txt|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_041.txt|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341_042.txt|I fell into it by accident.
p341_043.txt|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044.txt|This is a big advantage.
p341_045.txt|Her daughter is getting married.
p341_046.txt|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047.txt|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p341_048.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049.txt|Today is not about contracts.
p341_050.txt|That says something for his strength of character.
p341_051.txt|We are going for it.
p341_052.txt|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_053.txt|It's to do with play.
p341_054.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_055.txt|I've just got to do this.
p341_056.txt|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p341_057.txt|So the process was refined.
p341_058.txt|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_059.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p341_060.txt|I think it is a sensible change.
p341_061.txt|Sex is fun?
p341_062.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341_063.txt|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p341_064.txt|This is the crossroads.
p341_065.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p341_066.txt|He is pretty upset.
p341_067.txt|And who would argue with that?
p341_068.txt|Where is the human rights?
p341_069.txt|We must put a marker down.
p341_070.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071.txt|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341_072.txt|It is time to give her a rest.
p341_073.txt|They had had time for little else.
p341_074.txt|The feeling is awesome.
p341_075.txt|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341_076.txt|But there was a shift.
p341_077.txt|The settlement could run to millions.
p341_078.txt|It does not stop at the border.
p341_079.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p341_080.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_081.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p341_082.txt|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_083.txt|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p341_084.txt|They are going to carry it through.
p341_085.txt|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341_086.txt|You can't keep them separate.
p341_087.txt|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_088.txt|I still feel like a wee boy.
p341_089.txt|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341_090.txt|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_091.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p341_092.txt|Israel has done very little until now.
p341_093.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_094.txt|We are losing this war.
p341_095.txt|It's a difficult one to play.
p341_096.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p341_097.txt|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341_098.txt|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099.txt|We certainly will need to watch him.
p341_100.txt|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_101.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p341_102.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341_103.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p341_104.txt|We are trying to establish a date.
p341_105.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p341_106.txt|The website is now being amended.
p341_107.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p341_108.txt|I was a bit nervous.
p341_109.txt|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_110.txt|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_111.txt|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p341_112.txt|I love this tournament.
p341_113.txt|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_114.txt|He had a heart problem.
p341_115.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_116.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p341_117.txt|Both managements are very supportive.
p341_118.txt|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_119.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p341_120.txt|The choice is strictly personal.
p341_121.txt|We are going to go about our lives.
p341_122.txt|He had other things on his mind.
p341_123.txt|The lady is right.
p341_124.txt|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_125.txt|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p341_126.txt|The next few months will tell.
p341_127.txt|I'm so proud of my team.
p341_128.txt|It is crucial for both teams.
p341_129.txt|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p341_130.txt|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_131.txt|You can see their point.
p341_132.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p341_133.txt|There was no hint of bravado.
p341_134.txt|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_135.txt|Yet he chose to do something different.
p341_136.txt|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p341_137.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p341_138.txt|There were no casualties.
p341_139.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p341_140.txt|They really did a great job.
p341_141.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p341_142.txt|They are still going to be impulsive.
p341_143.txt|I love you so very much.
p341_144.txt|He is a very nice man.
p341_145.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p341_146.txt|Their condition was described as stable.
p341_147.txt|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_148.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p341_149.txt|I had a tie in my hand.
p341_150.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p341_151.txt|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p341_152.txt|Such a city does not exist.
p341_153.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p341_154.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p341_155.txt|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_156.txt|It was to no avail.
p341_157.txt|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_158.txt|But my heart is in athletics.
p341_159.txt|That is in the very nature of farming.
p341_160.txt|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_161.txt|These matters are now behind us.
p341_162.txt|I'm working on that.
p341_163.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_164.txt|It was then into overtime.
p341_165.txt|Most of the public are behind me.
p341_166.txt|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341_167.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p341_168.txt|Look at his last couple of records.
p341_169.txt|I am still very much a director.
p341_170.txt|We must not give in to bastards.
p341_171.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p341_172.txt|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p341_173.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p341_174.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p341_175.txt|Of course he is.
p341_176.txt|This is a very positive step forward.
p341_177.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p341_178.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p341_179.txt|And does it?
p341_180.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341_181.txt|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341_182.txt|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_183.txt|She is a very lucky lady.
p341_184.txt|It's the whole season.
p341_185.txt|We've been there for seven years.
p341_186.txt|Promises were not kept.
p341_187.txt|His signature is his handwriting.
p341_188.txt|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_189.txt|I've already done that.
p341_190.txt|We are on the path of change.
p341_191.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p341_192.txt|Who is he?
p341_193.txt|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_194.txt|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_195.txt|Felt good about it.
p341_196.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_197.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341_198.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_199.txt|What's the big idea?
p341_200.txt|One season, they might do well.
p341_201.txt|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341_202.txt|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p341_203.txt|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_204.txt|It's up to their parents to choose.
p341_205.txt|I feel privileged to be here.
p341_206.txt|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341_207.txt|She told me to apply for the crest.
p341_208.txt|Too much has already been said.
p341_209.txt|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p341_210.txt|He explained to his audience.
p341_211.txt|I think the Government should pay for that.
p341_212.txt|I asked why he had come.
p341_213.txt|He was a soldier.
p341_214.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p341_215.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_216.txt|It didn't get any better.
p341_217.txt|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_218.txt|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341_219.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p341_220.txt|I just could not cope.
p341_221.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_222.txt|It is all one-sided.
p341_223.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_224.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_225.txt|Here are some possible solutions.
p341_226.txt|That's the day job.
p341_227.txt|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_228.txt|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_229.txt|I'm not saying he is finished.
p341_230.txt|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341_231.txt|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_232.txt|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p341_233.txt|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p341_234.txt|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_236.txt|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p341_237.txt|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341_238.txt|We believe we have a strong case.
p341_239.txt|I lost it at the final whistle.
p341_240.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p341_241.txt|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_242.txt|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_243.txt|One must hope not!
p341_244.txt|It was a big day.
p341_245.txt|What makes a house a home?
p341_246.txt|I think however, he was having a fit!
p341_247.txt|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341_248.txt|I will not be pressured.
p341_249.txt|It doesn't make sense.
p341_250.txt|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_251.txt|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_252.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_253.txt|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341_254.txt|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p341_255.txt|Do not listen to them.
p341_256.txt|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p341_257.txt|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341_258.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p341_259.txt|Our system is archaic.
p341_260.txt|It was a tactical change.
p341_261.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p341_262.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341_263.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p341_264.txt|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341_265.txt|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p341_266.txt|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341_267.txt|She became very good at it.
p341_268.txt|We don't have the credible evidence.
p341_269.txt|It's one up to the Scots.
p341_270.txt|I'm just doing artwork.
p341_271.txt|And we still have to pay his salary.
p341_272.txt|Also, he was flawed.
p341_273.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_274.txt|So there's a double whammy.
p341_275.txt|I didn't have a trio.
p341_276.txt|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_277.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p341_278.txt|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_279.txt|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341_280.txt|I hope my successor will do the same.
p341_281.txt|The manager knew me very well.
p341_282.txt|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_283.txt|Are you in this movie?
p341_284.txt|We've got a full house tonight.
p341_285.txt|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341_286.txt|The fans will support us.
p341_287.txt|Make sure you see it.
p341_288.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p341_289.txt|We are aware of the two incidents.
p341_290.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341_291.txt|It was just one of those things.
p341_292.txt|The whole team was rubbish.
p341_293.txt|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_294.txt|You've got it coming Kabul.
p341_295.txt|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_296.txt|They too refused to come out and talk.
p341_297.txt|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341_298.txt|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p341_299.txt|That was enough for the committee.
p341_300.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p341_301.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341_302.txt|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p341_303.txt|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p341_304.txt|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_305.txt|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_306.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341_307.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p341_308.txt|We have to adapt to this level.
p341_309.txt|They were the better side on the day.
p341_310.txt|What are you going to do exactly?
p341_311.txt|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p341_312.txt|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_313.txt|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_314.txt|No-one thought about this.
p341_315.txt|We're all in a state of shock.
p341_316.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p341_317.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_318.txt|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_319.txt|This is very bad news.
p341_320.txt|He was released in March this year.
p341_321.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p341_322.txt|I stayed away from the defence.
p341_323.txt|We do need to get the message across.
p341_324.txt|Instead, she just went away.
p341_325.txt|That did not go down well.
p341_326.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341_327.txt|It was chaotic and frightening.
p341_328.txt|It is a question of balance.
p341_329.txt|Soon the whole country will be level.
p341_330.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p341_331.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_332.txt|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_333.txt|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341_334.txt|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341_335.txt|He said he needed no more evidence.
p341_336.txt|People might not actually want the job.
p341_337.txt|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_338.txt|It broke up my marriage.
p341_339.txt|They told us about it the next day.
p341_340.txt|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p341_341.txt|If there is default.
p341_342.txt|We are very nearly there.
p341_343.txt|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_344.txt|We have to go for it.
p341_345.txt|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_346.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p341_347.txt|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_348.txt|The urgency is real.
p341_349.txt|I've already got them in.
p341_350.txt|He takes time out for everyone.
p341_351.txt|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p341_352.txt|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_353.txt|I can't stop people thinking.
p341_354.txt|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_355.txt|I have not been so angry for years.
p341_356.txt|She had every right to read the warrant.
p341_357.txt|This is normal for him now.
p341_358.txt|Nothing was going to go right.
p341_359.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p341_360.txt|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_361.txt|That's an old idea.
p341_362.txt|Scotland is losing business.
p341_363.txt|The place became a war zone.
p341_364.txt|What's happening to her?
p341_365.txt|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341_366.txt|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341_367.txt|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_368.txt|I don't have a new house.
p341_369.txt|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341_370.txt|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_371.txt|You are a liar.
p341_372.txt|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_373.txt|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_374.txt|See it while you can.
p341_375.txt|Folk music is in her blood.
p341_376.txt|And we all understand that.
p341_377.txt|One policeman was killed.
p341_378.txt|And it's not funny.
p341_379.txt|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_380.txt|We cannot lose it.
p341_381.txt|They have learned from that.
p341_382.txt|We have been working together for some years.
p341_383.txt|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341_384.txt|We only lost the third goal.
p341_385.txt|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_386.txt|That gave us some confidence.
p341_387.txt|No-one has yet been charged.
p341_388.txt|Such people do not exist.
p341_389.txt|Is this new report the answer?
p341_390.txt|Then came the second round.
p341_391.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_392.txt|There was someone on the floor.
p341_393.txt|Story time is over - it's a war.
p341_394.txt|Maybe, who knows?
p341_395.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p341_396.txt|But it is all by design.
p341_397.txt|It was a sell-out.
p341_398.txt|We've still got a say in this.
p341_399.txt|Things are going very well.
p341_400.txt|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p341_401.txt|I'll take what comes along.
p341_402.txt|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_403.txt|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_404.txt|Golf has lost a great character.
p341_405.txt|You have to have some hope and faith.
p341_406.txt|They hold on for many years.
p341_407.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p341_408.txt|Women reported more depression than men.
p341_409.txt|He needs to be.
p341_410.txt|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p343_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p343_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p343_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p343_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p343_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_019.txt|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_020.txt|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p343_025.txt|I've got a long way to go.
p343_026.txt|I'll go to the races.
p343_027.txt|We will be back next year.
p343_028.txt|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343_029.txt|It is a crucial award.
p343_030.txt|People don't feel safe, including me.
p343_031.txt|Survival is our aim.
p343_032.txt|But it might have done.
p343_033.txt|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_034.txt|What can you do?
p343_035.txt|I read it every year.
p343_036.txt|I go in for the parts.
p343_037.txt|It should be the reverse.
p343_038.txt|We are a team of hard workers.
p343_039.txt|It is up to Ann.
p343_040.txt|And you know something?
p343_041.txt|We were with him the whole time.
p343_042.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p343_043.txt|We've all been here before.
p343_044.txt|I had troubles with the producers.
p343_045.txt|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343_046.txt|He died the following year.
p343_047.txt|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048.txt|He is trying really hard.
p343_049.txt|I have no doubt about that.
p343_050.txt|It is a beautiful country.
p343_051.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p343_052.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_053.txt|This was never a support group.
p343_054.txt|I must take a seat.
p343_055.txt|My mother is a widow.
p343_056.txt|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_058.txt|The matter will come up again.
p343_059.txt|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060.txt|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061.txt|He should be a great asset.
p343_062.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p343_063.txt|One thing is sure.
p343_064.txt|He has really done well.
p343_065.txt|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066.txt|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067.txt|Funding needs to be long term.
p343_068.txt|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069.txt|It was just awful.
p343_070.txt|That is really all.
p343_071.txt|We played too deeply.
p343_072.txt|We could have got three medals.
p343_073.txt|I am ready to go.
p343_074.txt|We are still suffering from that.
p343_075.txt|The script was funny.
p343_076.txt|We are at the crossroads.
p343_077.txt|I am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078.txt|They were at school together.
p343_079.txt|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_080.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p343_081.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p343_082.txt|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p343_083.txt|That was the easy election.
p343_084.txt|I didn't understand it.
p343_085.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_086.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_087.txt|No one was listening.
p343_088.txt|I will report in the spring.
p343_089.txt|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_090.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p343_091.txt|It's terrible that this is happening.
p343_092.txt|He's got the same story.
p343_093.txt|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343_094.txt|It is par for the course, of course.
p343_095.txt|And so it goes on.
p343_096.txt|The winner will be announced next month.
p343_097.txt|What was this?
p343_098.txt|I am not a fan of books.
p343_099.txt|It may well have been.
p343_100.txt|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_101.txt|We can only go up.
p343_102.txt|I am not a doctor.
p343_103.txt|It is all in the mind.
p343_104.txt|And we have beaten them before.
p343_105.txt|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_106.txt|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p343_107.txt|I am not a paedophile.
p343_108.txt|I've got to get noticed!
p343_109.txt|Not that it was needed.
p343_110.txt|It's up to them to decide.
p343_111.txt|But we can't have a casino.
p343_112.txt|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_113.txt|The odds are that it will.
p343_114.txt|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p343_115.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_116.txt|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_117.txt|He also has property interests in the country.
p343_118.txt|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343_119.txt|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_120.txt|I cannot believe this decision.
p343_121.txt|This decision is destroying my family.
p343_122.txt|Why is that?
p343_123.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p343_124.txt|We reckon we can do very well.
p343_125.txt|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_126.txt|It has been a great day.
p343_127.txt|We are not with you.
p343_128.txt|Then came the crunch.
p343_129.txt|If so, they were wrong.
p343_130.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343_131.txt|The answer is maybe.
p343_132.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343_133.txt|The referee had a shocking game.
p343_134.txt|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_135.txt|It's about doing things.
p343_136.txt|For a few years we had good fun.
p343_137.txt|All the pressure will be on him.
p343_139.txt|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_140.txt|That was a good effort.
p343_141.txt|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_142.txt|He must not be removed from office.
p343_143.txt|He had finally had enough.
p343_144.txt|But not all were so defiant.
p343_145.txt|We are not going to get carried away.
p343_146.txt|I told that to the police.
p343_147.txt|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343_148.txt|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_149.txt|But when we do it it is great.
p343_150.txt|I'm going to win the gold.
p343_151.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p343_152.txt|It always had to be about the gym.
p343_153.txt|Only one got through.
p343_154.txt|It's like a garage.
p343_155.txt|They've been wonderful to me.
p343_157.txt|I can't believe the buzz.
p343_158.txt|It is a traffic warden.
p343_159.txt|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343_160.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p343_161.txt|That never came to court as a charge.
p343_162.txt|Dancing was her life.
p343_163.txt|The latter way is my way.
p343_164.txt|Staff have been informed.
p343_165.txt|It is one of those things.
p343_166.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p343_167.txt|Are his works inside out?
p343_168.txt|He can do no wrong.
p343_169.txt|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343_170.txt|Do they have to create seven majors?
p343_171.txt|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_172.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343_173.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p343_174.txt|That began as an accident.
p343_175.txt|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343_176.txt|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_177.txt|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_178.txt|I am looking forward to this film.
p343_179.txt|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_180.txt|The talking cannot go on too long.
p343_181.txt|I've got a young family.
p343_182.txt|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_183.txt|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_184.txt|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_185.txt|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p343_186.txt|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p343_187.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343_188.txt|It was good today.
p343_189.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p343_190.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_191.txt|That tells you something.
p343_192.txt|It has been a magical moment.
p343_193.txt|Is that not uncanny?
p343_194.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_195.txt|The hotel was huge.
p343_196.txt|These days are over.
p343_197.txt|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_198.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p343_199.txt|Or so it is hoped.
p343_201.txt|He said to give a local injection.
p343_202.txt|This is an internal matter.
p343_203.txt|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_204.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p343_205.txt|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_206.txt|I was influenced by all of these things.
p343_207.txt|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_208.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343_209.txt|Children also died in Britain.
p343_210.txt|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_211.txt|We want to get there.
p343_213.txt|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_214.txt|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_215.txt|The hearing was fair.
p343_216.txt|He has the edge.
p343_217.txt|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_218.txt|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343_219.txt|He saw it all as a big game.
p343_220.txt|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_221.txt|Here we have not had one hour.
p343_222.txt|That was never their agenda.
p343_223.txt|But he kept on repeating it.
p343_224.txt|She is currently in foster care.
p343_225.txt|That's the only thing that matters.
p343_226.txt|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_227.txt|The service will only survive with change.
p343_228.txt|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p343_229.txt|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343_230.txt|You have a very persuasive president.
p343_231.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p343_232.txt|She has not returned to work.
p343_233.txt|We could learn a lot from them.
p343_234.txt|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_235.txt|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_236.txt|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_237.txt|It's really good fun.
p343_238.txt|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_239.txt|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_240.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p343_241.txt|We did not complete the process.
p343_242.txt|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343_243.txt|Where are you taking her?
p343_244.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p343_245.txt|They have not been named.
p343_246.txt|He died later in hospital.
p343_247.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p343_248.txt|He had a great game.
p343_249.txt|It's still got that at its heart.
p343_250.txt|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343_251.txt|We will turn the corner.
p343_252.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p343_253.txt|There were too many mistakes.
p343_254.txt|He says it often enough.
p343_255.txt|However, my position remains the same.
p343_256.txt|It was totally out of the blue.
p343_257.txt|Horses are not affected.
p343_258.txt|It went on forever.
p343_259.txt|I'm not going to change from it.
p343_260.txt|And they are different.
p343_261.txt|It would have been very easily done.
p343_262.txt|He knows the course.
p343_263.txt|That idea is rubbish.
p343_264.txt|There is no room for error.
p343_265.txt|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_266.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p343_267.txt|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p343_268.txt|We are all suffering.
p343_269.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p343_270.txt|That is a question for the next manager.
p343_271.txt|I knew people on that committee.
p343_273.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p343_274.txt|There was no argument.
p343_275.txt|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_276.txt|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_277.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p343_278.txt|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_279.txt|We are talking about one family.
p343_280.txt|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_281.txt|The error appeared in a warrant.
p343_282.txt|Everything is so new.
p343_283.txt|It may take time to get it back.
p343_284.txt|Would they work together again?
p343_285.txt|I can feel the sound inside.
p343_286.txt|The answer is yes.
p343_287.txt|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_288.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_289.txt|That is a personal matter.
p343_290.txt|The princess has had other health problems.
p343_291.txt|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_292.txt|The clarity is vital.
p343_293.txt|I could not sit in the stands.
p343_294.txt|He had a decision to make.
p343_295.txt|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_296.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p343_297.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p343_298.txt|It's the whole package.
p343_299.txt|I was totally wrong.
p343_300.txt|This has got to stop.
p343_301.txt|It was a matter of chance.
p343_302.txt|There is no point of looking any further.
p343_303.txt|It is a real concern.
p343_304.txt|Is it the flight?
p343_306.txt|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p343_307.txt|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_308.txt|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_309.txt|A compromise is essential.
p343_310.txt|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p343_311.txt|They need to be involved.
p343_312.txt|It was not a cover-up.
p343_313.txt|The children continue to talk to us.
p343_314.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p343_315.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p343_316.txt|She went home from school and never returned.
p343_317.txt|I will work on her.
p343_318.txt|We told them in August.
p343_319.txt|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343_320.txt|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_321.txt|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_322.txt|It is now being examined.
p343_323.txt|It is so out of character.
p343_324.txt|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_325.txt|Our thoughts are with her.
p343_326.txt|It is time, he said.
p343_327.txt|Everyone believes in it.
p343_328.txt|We must learn to finish.
p343_331.txt|He was a one off.
p343_332.txt|That should give me a chance.
p343_333.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343_334.txt|It is my last chance.
p343_335.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p343_336.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p343_337.txt|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_338.txt|He didn't let me down.
p343_339.txt|You have been warned.
p343_340.txt|We're not comparing like with like.
p343_341.txt|I started on fire a couple of times.
p343_342.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343.txt|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343_344.txt|They will be up for it for sure.
p343_345.txt|So you let me know.
p343_346.txt|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343_347.txt|That will just be the beginning.
p343_348.txt|No one can say that about me.
p343_349.txt|That had not happened on this occasion.
p343_350.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p343_351.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p343_352.txt|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p343_353.txt|It is safe in our hands.
p343_354.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343_355.txt|We will need to look at that.
p343_356.txt|It comes down to the police in England.
p343_357.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_358.txt|It is a gamble.
p343_359.txt|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p343_360.txt|The tribunal continues today.
p343_361.txt|These things have not happened by accident.
p343_362.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p343_363.txt|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p343_364.txt|There's a hint of classical.
p343_365.txt|We had to take action to protect them.
p343_366.txt|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_367.txt|In the end, however, it all came together.
p343_368.txt|He is a visionary.
p343_369.txt|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_370.txt|There is always the smell.
p343_371.txt|I have to take some of the blame.
p343_372.txt|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_374.txt|He is lying to save his skin.
p343_375.txt|You have to do your research.
p343_376.txt|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343_377.txt|He took away my childhood.
p343_378.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379.txt|The call was ignored.
p343_381.txt|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343_382.txt|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p343_383.txt|And there is another problem.
p343_384.txt|That is the theory.
p343_385.txt|It almost certainly is.
p343_386.txt|They will have five minutes to decide.
p343_387.txt|Because it's a secret.
p343_388.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p343_389.txt|The body follows the mind.
p343_390.txt|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p343_391.txt|They are there to help us.
p343_392.txt|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_393.txt|You take a risk.
p343_394.txt|Which he is, too.
p343_395.txt|Each one is as good as the other.
p343_396.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p343_397.txt|I have hardly any commitments.
p343_398.txt|There is no formula.
p343_399.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p343_400.txt|I love the feel of the place.
p345_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p345_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p345_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p345_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p345_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p345_025.txt|This is a new era.
p345_026.txt|I want to go home.
p345_027.txt|All the people here are local.
p345_028.txt|The racist abuse was terrible.
p345_029.txt|What is the new religion?
p345_030.txt|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_031.txt|It's an amazing landscape!
p345_032.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p345_033.txt|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_034.txt|We had to laugh.
p345_035.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345_036.txt|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_037.txt|I was completely knackered.
p345_038.txt|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_039.txt|A killer is also on the loose.
p345_040.txt|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p345_042.txt|You can see how he made his money.
p345_043.txt|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345_044.txt|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345_045.txt|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047.txt|His record with England was not good.
p345_048.txt|The opposite is the case.
p345_049.txt|Who would be a referee?
p345_050.txt|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345_051.txt|It was time to act.
p345_052.txt|It's a question of fashion.
p345_053.txt|I could never be cool.
p345_054.txt|We will be paying agency rates.
p345_055.txt|Others said he had gone too far.
p345_056.txt|We expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057.txt|He was between people and God.
p345_058.txt|I've never seen anything like it.
p345_059.txt|They were willing us to get a second.
p345_060.txt|No casualties were reported.
p345_061.txt|The classes are taking place.
p345_062.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_063.txt|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064.txt|There will be no threat to the game.
p345_065.txt|It would be a last resort.
p345_066.txt|That is part of athletics.
p345_067.txt|Who would have known.
p345_068.txt|We were caught out.
p345_069.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p345_070.txt|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071.txt|I had to lie.
p345_072.txt|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073.txt|Everyone was writing me off.
p345_074.txt|How do we get more people in?
p345_075.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076.txt|But her parents will never see her again.
p345_077.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078.txt|I have nothing to lose.
p345_079.txt|He would have loved it.
p345_080.txt|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345_081.txt|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_082.txt|It is a freedom.
p345_083.txt|What happens next?
p345_084.txt|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_085.txt|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_086.txt|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_087.txt|They should come clean.
p345_088.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_089.txt|I believe that so strongly.
p345_090.txt|That, though, is an old story.
p345_091.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p345_092.txt|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_093.txt|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_094.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p345_095.txt|He was at it again yesterday.
p345_096.txt|You can't go on forever.
p345_097.txt|So far this season this approach is working.
p345_098.txt|However, his involvement was instant.
p345_099.txt|It has to work.
p345_100.txt|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345_101.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345_102.txt|There's something about being cut off.
p345_103.txt|This is his personal life.
p345_104.txt|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p345_105.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p345_106.txt|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_107.txt|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_108.txt|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_109.txt|What are they like?
p345_110.txt|I would probably have to agree with him.
p345_111.txt|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_112.txt|He had a moustache.
p345_113.txt|I have been thinking about that this week.
p345_114.txt|Let's get it on.
p345_115.txt|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_116.txt|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_117.txt|It is really good news.
p345_118.txt|We just want a fair deal.
p345_119.txt|I'll just have to live with that.
p345_120.txt|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_121.txt|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_122.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_123.txt|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p345_124.txt|It is sad and frustrating.
p345_125.txt|Our intentions are real.
p345_126.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_127.txt|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_128.txt|She has left the island.
p345_129.txt|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345_130.txt|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345_131.txt|It certainly should not be used too often.
p345_132.txt|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_133.txt|I don't know where that one came from.
p345_134.txt|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_135.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p345_136.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_137.txt|That's not fair to the supporters.
p345_138.txt|I was on my own.
p345_139.txt|They were part of our own family.
p345_140.txt|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_141.txt|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_142.txt|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_143.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_144.txt|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345_145.txt|His name has not been released.
p345_146.txt|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345_147.txt|It plainly does not work.
p345_148.txt|His words were not audible.
p345_149.txt|That's a huge amount.
p345_150.txt|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p345_151.txt|It was even worse than at home.
p345_152.txt|I still think he will win.
p345_153.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_154.txt|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_155.txt|It may have been a cry for help.
p345_156.txt|But the damage had been done.
p345_157.txt|No, you couldn't make it up.
p345_158.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_159.txt|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345_160.txt|And so they have.
p345_161.txt|I have a great respect for her.
p345_162.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p345_163.txt|IT takes the biscuit.
p345_164.txt|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_165.txt|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_166.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p345_167.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p345_168.txt|But it won't be the same.
p345_169.txt|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345_170.txt|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_171.txt|It is a hobby for me.
p345_172.txt|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_173.txt|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_174.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p345_175.txt|We should have gone solo.
p345_176.txt|Directing, if you like.
p345_177.txt|That will be the case.
p345_178.txt|Now, it's all right.
p345_179.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p345_180.txt|They have known the hard times.
p345_181.txt|We don't know what happened.
p345_182.txt|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_183.txt|They had seven children.
p345_184.txt|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_185.txt|Death is outside the language.
p345_186.txt|You have a plan?
p345_187.txt|It's all too early.
p345_188.txt|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_189.txt|We've seen that time and time again.
p345_190.txt|I was never alone with her, right?
p345_191.txt|It's not only my respect for them.
p345_192.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345_193.txt|This is a very high price.
p345_194.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_195.txt|I never want to have any children.
p345_196.txt|Business has never been so bad.
p345_197.txt|There is no way to do this.
p345_198.txt|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_199.txt|I know my sons.
p345_200.txt|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_201.txt|It was too close to call.
p345_202.txt|But who is the killer?
p345_203.txt|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345_204.txt|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_205.txt|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345_206.txt|Then another one came.
p345_207.txt|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_208.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p345_209.txt|The Lobby is not failing.
p345_210.txt|But it is looking very positive.
p345_211.txt|Drugs are getting through.
p345_212.txt|He would have come into the house.
p345_213.txt|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_214.txt|It happens in real life.
p345_215.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p345_216.txt|And we will do it.
p345_217.txt|It's a human tragedy.
p345_218.txt|But we are losing that connection.
p345_219.txt|I am going to fight to the end.
p345_220.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_221.txt|It's the right thing.
p345_222.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p345_223.txt|Must have been at the bar.
p345_224.txt|But this is just the start.
p345_225.txt|I can't get away from it.
p345_226.txt|I believe in the Union.
p345_227.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p345_228.txt|But he is not hopeful.
p345_229.txt|It will be all about the Olympics.
p345_230.txt|They are very frightened.
p345_231.txt|We have all been there at some point.
p345_232.txt|This is my homeland.
p345_233.txt|The game was up.
p345_234.txt|That is not an easy thing.
p345_235.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_236.txt|I didn't know where they were.
p345_237.txt|Rangers are my life.
p345_238.txt|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_239.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p345_240.txt|There are two options.
p345_241.txt|I can't describe it.
p345_242.txt|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_243.txt|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_244.txt|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345_245.txt|This is wonderful news.
p345_246.txt|I am appalled by this news.
p345_247.txt|No injuries were reported.
p345_248.txt|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p345_249.txt|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_250.txt|It's too much work.
p345_251.txt|We were extremely arrogant.
p345_252.txt|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_253.txt|THE waiting game continues.
p345_254.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_255.txt|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_256.txt|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_257.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p345_258.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_259.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_260.txt|What is so unusual about this case?
p345_261.txt|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_262.txt|But this is different.
p345_263.txt|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_264.txt|It doesn't look good.
p345_265.txt|That will not change.
p345_267.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_268.txt|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_269.txt|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_270.txt|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_271.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p345_272.txt|This action could have been avoided.
p345_273.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_274.txt|And they still have the final to come.
p345_275.txt|Anyone else can apply.
p345_276.txt|He looked like a schoolboy.
p345_277.txt|It was like the old days.
p345_278.txt|But that is about to change.
p345_279.txt|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_280.txt|We can build on that.
p345_281.txt|It could be a danger.
p345_282.txt|We are not going to be complacent.
p345_283.txt|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345_284.txt|His body was found in May.
p345_285.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p345_286.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345_287.txt|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_288.txt|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_289.txt|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p345_290.txt|It starts to get you down.
p345_291.txt|I don't think we could have expected better.
p345_292.txt|My life has been turned upside down.
p345_293.txt|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_294.txt|But they miss the whole point.
p345_295.txt|You have to count on other people.
p345_296.txt|I said, What was that about?
p345_297.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p345_298.txt|This could prove a problem.
p345_299.txt|I was a local hero.
p345_300.txt|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p345_301.txt|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_302.txt|It's a gigantic con.
p345_303.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345_304.txt|This club have been fair to me.
p345_305.txt|I didn't know she could do that.
p345_306.txt|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_307.txt|This is too much like Scotland.
p345_308.txt|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309.txt|A counter reaction was.
p345_310.txt|That goes back a long way.
p345_311.txt|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_312.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p345_313.txt|They were not missing much.
p345_314.txt|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_315.txt|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_316.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317.txt|It's always a dilemma.
p345_318.txt|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345_319.txt|Is she in trouble?
p345_320.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p345_321.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p345_322.txt|It is a very beautiful city.
p345_323.txt|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345_324.txt|But could it afford to run it?
p345_325.txt|I am very happy with him.
p345_326.txt|I was waiting for that question.
p345_327.txt|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_328.txt|I am not against a further inquiry.
p345_329.txt|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345_330.txt|WHO would have thought it?
p345_331.txt|We will win the argument.
p345_332.txt|Five years later, the deception continued.
p345_333.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p345_334.txt|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_335.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_336.txt|I just want to do the good work.
p345_337.txt|I'm very happy tonight.
p345_338.txt|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_339.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_340.txt|Now it was serious.
p345_341.txt|This is his first movie.
p345_342.txt|He is already in place.
p345_343.txt|No one would believe him.
p345_344.txt|We live in shorthand.
p345_345.txt|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_346.txt|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_347.txt|I made a big mistake.
p345_348.txt|I just know it's a lot.
p345_349.txt|I saw one body.
p345_350.txt|I am very happy.
p345_351.txt|There was no discussion about it.
p345_352.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p345_353.txt|It was a very big win for us.
p345_354.txt|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_355.txt|Everything is up for grabs.
p345_356.txt|We had a good time.
p345_357.txt|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345_358.txt|This was a good performance.
p345_359.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p345_360.txt|It is not simple.
p345_361.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_362.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p345_363.txt|It is a road of death.
p345_364.txt|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345_365.txt|Her life is now back on track.
p345_366.txt|I said at the time it was wrong.
p345_367.txt|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_368.txt|Anything that was going, really.
p345_369.txt|He will take it in his stride.
p345_370.txt|I don't believe a word of it.
p345_371.txt|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_372.txt|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_373.txt|The winner will be announced in December.
p345_374.txt|This is bound to happen.
p345_375.txt|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345_376.txt|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_377.txt|The letters are going out today.
p345_378.txt|I did not name it.
p345_379.txt|And therein lies the problem.
p345_380.txt|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p345_381.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_382.txt|Or is it?
p345_383.txt|Is he going to look after them?
p345_384.txt|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_385.txt|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345_386.txt|It is quite simple.
p345_389.txt|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_390.txt|His instructions were clear.
p345_391.txt|There is ample evidence.
p345_392.txt|It was a game we had to win.
p345_393.txt|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_394.txt|To begin with it looks good.
p345_395.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p345_396.txt|There is still a long way to go.
p345_397.txt|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345_398.txt|This was a unique election.
p345_399.txt|It was still there last night.
p345_400.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p347_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p347_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p347_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p347_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p347_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p347_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p347_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p347_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p347_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p347_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p347_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p347_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p347_025.txt|A crucial moment has arrived.
p347_026.txt|We still have a long, long way to go.
p347_027.txt|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_028.txt|There are moments of silence.
p347_029.txt|So now this series has had its day.
p347_030.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347_031.txt|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347_032.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_033.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p347_034.txt|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_035.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p347_036.txt|It is time for a new approach.
p347_037.txt|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
p347_038.txt|We have nothing to say about that.
p347_039.txt|We've tried every other way.
p347_040.txt|I'll have to go out and impress.
p347_041.txt|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p347_043.txt|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_044.txt|It does make a big difference.
p347_045.txt|How many cases have there been?
p347_046.txt|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p347_047.txt|You can't give in to the vandals.
p347_048.txt|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347_049.txt|Everything was an effort.
p347_050.txt|And does it even matter?
p347_051.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_052.txt|My parents are exhausted.
p347_053.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p347_054.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p347_055.txt|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p347_056.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p347_057.txt|It will come up here.
p347_058.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p347_059.txt|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_060.txt|It is a very special city.
p347_061.txt|This is only the start of my season.
p347_062.txt|The message is just not getting through.
p347_063.txt|It sounded awfully like panic.
p347_064.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p347_065.txt|This is a big, big win.
p347_066.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p347_067.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p347_068.txt|We were given a break.
p347_069.txt|He already had had complaints.
p347_070.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_071.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_072.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p347_073.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p347_074.txt|I think we will join the single currency.
p347_075.txt|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_076.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p347_077.txt|One thing is certain.
p347_078.txt|We cannot ask for them back.
p347_079.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p347_080.txt|No-one said anything to me.
p347_081.txt|All of us do.
p347_082.txt|That is in the public domain.
p347_083.txt|The Hague is too good for him.
p347_084.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p347_085.txt|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p347_086.txt|It's a true story.
p347_087.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p347_088.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p347_089.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p347_090.txt|It is a hangover effect.
p347_091.txt|This is my life.
p347_092.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p347_093.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p347_094.txt|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_095.txt|We gave them the goal.
p347_096.txt|They don't take you to mass graves.
p347_097.txt|There was no option.
p347_098.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p347_099.txt|Could they perhaps be related?
p347_100.txt|But who shot the president?
p347_101.txt|We do not get that impression now.
p347_102.txt|I'm looking forward to that.
p347_103.txt|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p347_104.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p347_105.txt|That's why he visited.
p347_106.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p347_107.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p347_108.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p347_109.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p347_110.txt|It needs somebody to give way.
p347_111.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p347_112.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347_113.txt|They are all Arabs.
p347_114.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p347_115.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p347_116.txt|That is our unfinished business.
p347_117.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p347_118.txt|Faces from the Eighties.
p347_119.txt|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347_120.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p347_121.txt|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p347_122.txt|You can cope with it.
p347_123.txt|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p347_124.txt|They will do their own thing.
p347_125.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p347_126.txt|We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_127.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p347_128.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p347_129.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p347_130.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347_131.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p347_132.txt|All the people thought that we would die.
p347_133.txt|It is never an easy game.
p347_134.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p347_135.txt|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p347_136.txt|I don't want to come down.
p347_137.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p347_138.txt|I thought it was quite good.
p347_139.txt|He had reason to be pleased.
p347_140.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p347_141.txt|That is impressive by any standards.
p347_142.txt|I felt we needed to bring that in.
p347_143.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347_144.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p347_145.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p347_146.txt|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p347_147.txt|Too many factors are now working against him.
p347_148.txt|Is the war over?
p347_149.txt|You do have a way out.
p347_150.txt|It is simple, really.
p347_151.txt|I just wasn't very good.
p347_152.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_153.txt|But he is not using them.
p347_154.txt|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347_155.txt|I certainly believe we can do it.
p347_156.txt|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347_157.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p347_158.txt|That's been our position all along.
p347_159.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p347_160.txt|We have not had a formal request.
p347_161.txt|I never had a childhood.
p347_162.txt|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347_163.txt|We offered something different.
p347_164.txt|We were very much a happy family.
p347_165.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p347_166.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p347_167.txt|It's going to be epic.
p347_168.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p347_169.txt|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_170.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p347_171.txt|British officials said they could not say.
p347_172.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p347_173.txt|I never found my rhythm.
p347_174.txt|I didn't mean to kill her.
p347_175.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p347_176.txt|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p347_177.txt|We might be back next year.
p347_178.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347_179.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p347_180.txt|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_181.txt|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p347_182.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p347_183.txt|This area is perfect for children.
p347_184.txt|The firm was down and almost out.
p347_185.txt|I was chosen to do this.
p347_186.txt|I learned a lot from that.
p347_187.txt|I think we're very different.
p347_188.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347_189.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p347_190.txt|Glasgow then took control.
p347_191.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p347_192.txt|My ambitions are still with football.
p347_193.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347_194.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p347_195.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p347_196.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347_197.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p347_198.txt|Our approach will be different.
p347_199.txt|It's not right of Labour.
p347_200.txt|It is legally binding.
p347_201.txt|We went straight into the bedroom.
p347_202.txt|Before the games it was pretty open.
p347_203.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p347_204.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p347_205.txt|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p347_206.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p347_207.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p347_208.txt|Who can tell?
p347_209.txt|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347_210.txt|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_211.txt|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_212.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p347_213.txt|Or some thought that they have.
p347_214.txt|He has lost confidence and weight.
p347_215.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p347_216.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_217.txt|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347_218.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_219.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p347_220.txt|It could not be too high.
p347_221.txt|Or so it would appear.
p347_222.txt|Do not forget about Monaco.
p347_223.txt|I hope they understand that.
p347_224.txt|You can never tell.
p347_225.txt|But Annika is just amazing.
p347_226.txt|Our job is to change that.
p347_227.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p347_228.txt|The damage has been done.
p347_229.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p347_230.txt|That's the National Grid.
p347_231.txt|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p347_232.txt|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p347_233.txt|It is a big time for me.
p347_234.txt|There were two things going on at once.
p347_235.txt|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347_236.txt|It is a cause for concern.
p347_237.txt|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p347_238.txt|That is the key message.
p347_239.txt|It ignores the future.
p347_240.txt|This is the subway.
p347_241.txt|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p347_242.txt|What's the rush?
p347_243.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347_244.txt|He's in with the furniture.
p347_245.txt|Do not go into government buildings.
p347_246.txt|There is only one caveat.
p347_247.txt|We are still getting signals.
p347_248.txt|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p347_249.txt|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347_250.txt|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_251.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p347_252.txt|There are a few changes.
p347_253.txt|You're not going to get hurt.
p347_254.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347_255.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p347_256.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p347_257.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p347_258.txt|I am a little bit tired.
p347_259.txt|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347_260.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p347_261.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p347_262.txt|I have just got to get back.
p347_263.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347_264.txt|Players want to know what is on offer.
p347_265.txt|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p347_266.txt|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p347_267.txt|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347_268.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p347_269.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p347_270.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p347_271.txt|It was a journey into a new life.
p347_272.txt|It will be the final push.
p347_273.txt|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p347_274.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p347_275.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p347_276.txt|Arguably, they have already done it.
p347_277.txt|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347_278.txt|Raymond was always on the outside.
p347_279.txt|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p347_280.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p347_281.txt|I am a committed European.
p347_282.txt|There are no plans to change this.
p347_283.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p347_284.txt|It's in the eyes.
p347_285.txt|Working with him is like working with myself.
p347_286.txt|It is just too long since the war.
p347_287.txt|She didn't tell us anything new.
p347_288.txt|I mean it happens.
p347_289.txt|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p347_290.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p347_291.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347_292.txt|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p347_293.txt|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p347_294.txt|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
p347_295.txt|It is typical of me.
p347_296.txt|Raised the way you want it.
p347_297.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p347_298.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p347_299.txt|They played it like a cup final.
p347_300.txt|This has a number of benefits.
p347_301.txt|I will carry on.
p347_302.txt|I think it is a great shame.
p347_303.txt|A review of the decision is being sought.
p347_304.txt|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p347_305.txt|The chief constable is right.
p347_306.txt|And we were right.
p347_307.txt|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p347_308.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347_309.txt|Surely it can do better than that?
p347_310.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p347_311.txt|I think that could work to our advantage.
p347_312.txt|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p347_313.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p347_314.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347_315.txt|We hope this scheme will change that.
p347_316.txt|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347_317.txt|The red card was okay.
p347_318.txt|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_319.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p347_320.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p347_321.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p347_322.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p347_323.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p347_324.txt|This is my music.
p347_325.txt|I haven't won the world title.
p347_326.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p347_327.txt|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p347_328.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347_329.txt|There is no date on this document.
p347_330.txt|And now he tells us.
p347_331.txt|I am not changing my event.
p347_332.txt|I know nothing about that.
p347_333.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p347_334.txt|That is as it may be.
p347_335.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p347_336.txt|This is the start of a new campaign.
p347_337.txt|Eleven events are required.
p347_338.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p347_339.txt|You encourage them - you can do it.
p347_340.txt|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p347_341.txt|I always said No.
p347_342.txt|Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_343.txt|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347_344.txt|It is very much a matter for them.
p347_345.txt|Our future was his future.
p347_346.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p347_347.txt|It has made a difference.
p347_348.txt|He's got a great chance of making it.
p347_349.txt|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p347_350.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p347_351.txt|So now you know.
p347_352.txt|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p347_353.txt|It's a very special unit.
p347_354.txt|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_355.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347_356.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p347_357.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p347_358.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p347_359.txt|Which he can do.
p347_360.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p347_361.txt|They were that poor.
p347_362.txt|And we're talking Big Money.
p347_363.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p347_364.txt|I was a little surprised.
p347_365.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p347_366.txt|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p347_367.txt|They believed it worked.
p347_368.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p347_369.txt|As it happened, it was much more than that.
p347_370.txt|It's an internal matter.
p347_371.txt|They should feel ashamed.
p347_372.txt|You realise what this means?
p347_373.txt|We're delighted about the vote.
p347_374.txt|They were only there for three weeks.
p347_375.txt|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p347_376.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347_377.txt|It is just completely erased.
p347_378.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p347_379.txt|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p347_380.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p347_381.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p347_382.txt|Election results are expected soon.
p347_383.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p347_384.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p347_385.txt|They didn't find anything.
p347_386.txt|Is that where we are?
p347_387.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p347_388.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p347_389.txt|I suspect that it will.
p347_390.txt|But there's no eye contact.
p347_391.txt|There was no energy behind it.
p347_392.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p347_393.txt|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p347_394.txt|I took a minibus into town.
p347_395.txt|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347_396.txt|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347_397.txt|It is not a wish list.
p347_398.txt|Some of the players have not progressed.
p347_399.txt|They were both very brave.
p347_400.txt|There is no margin for error.
p347_401.txt|Why should we even be asked to share?
p347_402.txt|It was not a foul.
p347_403.txt|I get very excited by that.
p347_404.txt|The members have clearly spoken.
p347_405.txt|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p347_406.txt|I believe in God.
p347_407.txt|Which means it matters.
p347_408.txt|There is great potential on this river.
p347_409.txt|We can't win a big game.
p347_410.txt|It was a stunning strike.
p347_411.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p347_412.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p347_413.txt|We are going through difficult times.
p347_414.txt|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p347_415.txt|What exactly is your job?
p347_416.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p347_417.txt|There's nothing for you here.
p347_418.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p347_419.txt|They wanted to show what they could do.
p347_420.txt|I just want to get rid of it.
p347_421.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p347_422.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p347_423.txt|I have not come in to take over.
p347_424.txt|Is this accurate?
p351_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p351_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p351_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p351_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p351_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p351_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p351_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p351_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p351_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p351_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p351_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p351_025.txt|It was by the numbers.
p351_026.txt|I don't think they can complain about that.
p351_027.txt|I have not seen the term immediate.
p351_028.txt|My Dad is a hero.
p351_029.txt|It is my fault.
p351_030.txt|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351_031.txt|He added, We have the same desire.
p351_032.txt|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p351_033.txt|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_034.txt|Teachers have been given the offer.
p351_035.txt|We have to win every game.
p351_036.txt|They also have good neighbours.
p351_037.txt|Both sides will be aware of this.
p351_038.txt|They are not advertised.
p351_039.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p351_040.txt|We are getting people into work.
p351_041.txt|Will we ever play together again?
p351_042.txt|What are the barriers?
p351_043.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p351_044.txt|Who are the democrats?
p351_045.txt|You had to go and see him.
p351_046.txt|What did you learn in school today?
p351_047.txt|We know we can defend it.
p351_048.txt|That is not the case.
p351_049.txt|He met his wife and married in England.
p351_050.txt|Instead we were shot in the back.
p351_051.txt|This isn't a gimmick.
p351_052.txt|I won't go back.
p351_053.txt|There is no signature on this document.
p351_054.txt|We could not compete with Rangers.
p351_055.txt|There was mystery back then.
p351_056.txt|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_057.txt|Now it has become a big picture.
p351_058.txt|The jury is still out.
p351_059.txt|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p351_060.txt|They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_061.txt|We are not the first to be affected.
p351_062.txt|My players are special.
p351_063.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p351_064.txt|The devil is in the detail.
p351_065.txt|His handling raises a wider issue.
p351_066.txt|We have got the school holidays on.
p351_067.txt|We can't go home.
p351_068.txt|That just wasn't good enough.
p351_069.txt|The working families tax credit is far better.
p351_070.txt|those who are preparing to give up.
p351_071.txt|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p351_072.txt|I feel alive and good today.
p351_073.txt|She was married with one son.
p351_074.txt|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p351_075.txt|It was a pretty terrible day.
p351_076.txt|His track record is impressive.
p351_077.txt|Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_078.txt|It is tough, but possible.
p351_079.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p351_080.txt|I don't understand it.
p351_081.txt|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p351_082.txt|He was rejected because he had retired.
p351_083.txt|I just wanted to get off the course.
p351_084.txt|She was also very brave.
p351_085.txt|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_086.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p351_087.txt|Things are meant to be.
p351_088.txt|One year later, he finally decided to act.
p351_089.txt|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p351_090.txt|This is already happening.
p351_091.txt|We have a rehearsal.
p351_092.txt|Four had been brought down.
p351_093.txt|Only he's not as young as he looks.
p351_094.txt|The matter is under discussion.
p351_095.txt|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p351_096.txt|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351_097.txt|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_098.txt|They have played their part.
p351_099.txt|They were unable to revive him.
p351_100.txt|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p351_101.txt|In part that reflected the times.
p351_102.txt|That is not true.
p351_103.txt|Yes, it was too short a night.
p351_104.txt|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351_106.txt|We have no excuses.
p351_107.txt|- Really you will !
p351_108.txt|The driver was unhurt.
p351_109.txt|Who will pay for this?
p351_110.txt|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
p351_111.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p351_112.txt|It's all about money, money, money.
p351_113.txt|What's the problem?
p351_114.txt|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p351_115.txt|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_116.txt|It's the way we go about it.
p351_117.txt|I will be ridiculed.
p351_118.txt|There's nothing new in that argument.
p351_119.txt|This time it was out of the blue.
p351_120.txt|We need to get the right people in.
p351_121.txt|It is a great shame.
p351_122.txt|We were not going to take that risk.
p351_123.txt|Last night he became one of the hunted.
p351_124.txt|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351_125.txt|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p351_126.txt|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p351_127.txt|The truth, of course, is very different.
p351_128.txt|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351_129.txt|These will take a little time to develop.
p351_130.txt|I might come back.
p351_131.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p351_132.txt|But, still, it wasn't working.
p351_133.txt|That was my mistake.
p351_134.txt|We can play better than that.
p351_135.txt|My whole family is.
p351_136.txt|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p351_137.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p351_138.txt|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p351_139.txt|There has been no delay on government orders.
p351_140.txt|I think we can overcome it.
p351_141.txt|We will be victorious.
p351_142.txt|The other question is why the scaling down?
p351_143.txt|It was the crowning point of my career.
p351_144.txt|But it will be sorted out this week.
p351_145.txt|It's just a fact.
p351_146.txt|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351_147.txt|It was a discussion paper.
p351_148.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p351_149.txt|They will be ready.
p351_150.txt|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p351_151.txt|He is walking free.
p351_152.txt|There is nothing they can't do.
p351_153.txt|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_154.txt|If you can work, you should work.
p351_155.txt|This was a very tragic accident.
p351_156.txt|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351_157.txt|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p351_158.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p351_159.txt|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p351_160.txt|They might also be parlous.
p351_161.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p351_162.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351_163.txt|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_164.txt|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_165.txt|It is not an escape.
p351_166.txt|It feels that the game is off.
p351_167.txt|He is very confident at the moment.
p351_168.txt|Well, what can you do?
p351_169.txt|It is not the message alone.
p351_170.txt|They will be seen for years to come.
p351_171.txt|I'm really happy with how things went there.
p351_172.txt|He will be greatly missed.
p351_173.txt|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
p351_174.txt|But is that possible?
p351_175.txt|In many ways, that is as important.
p351_176.txt|I think we're going to make it.
p351_177.txt|It was really frustrating.
p351_178.txt|Clubs can only do so much.
p351_179.txt|Many other areas are coming up.
p351_180.txt|It would have very little impact on them.
p351_181.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351_182.txt|That's the way things are heading.
p351_183.txt|We were extremely poor.
p351_184.txt|The parties have no contact.
p351_185.txt|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p351_186.txt|We are still paying the price for that.
p351_187.txt|It was better than a soap opera.
p351_188.txt|There will be no change in government.
p351_189.txt|I am just grateful he is alive.
p351_190.txt|This is a special place for me.
p351_191.txt|This was a great result for us, a big result.
p351_192.txt|Our policy is clear.
p351_193.txt|This was an hour before the show.
p351_194.txt|It is crucial to understand this in context.
p351_195.txt|I now know that from memory.
p351_196.txt|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p351_197.txt|We expect a full house on the night.
p351_198.txt|He invented the language.
p351_199.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p351_200.txt|We need to know more about her.
p351_201.txt|I went away to recover fully.
p351_202.txt|Ownership was the game.
p351_203.txt|It makes a huge difference.
p351_204.txt|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351_205.txt|It's not a new device.
p351_206.txt|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p351_207.txt|Six years is too long.
p351_208.txt|They are not a set of options.
p351_209.txt|It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_210.txt|If only the problems concerned the players.
p351_211.txt|But it was money well spent.
p351_212.txt|That's the most important thing for me.
p351_213.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p351_214.txt|No decision has yet been made.
p351_215.txt|I have had a lovely summer.
p351_216.txt|Which is fair enough.
p351_217.txt|He took over our lives.
p351_218.txt|The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351_219.txt|This is a historic agreement.
p351_220.txt|He had worked there for only two days.
p351_221.txt|We just want them home.
p351_222.txt|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p351_223.txt|I was happily surprised.
p351_224.txt|It may not even be possible.
p351_225.txt|I think it is a scandal.
p351_226.txt|Perhaps it was just as well.
p351_227.txt|That, though, was then.
p351_228.txt|I grew up with them.
p351_229.txt|It was the train coming.
p351_230.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351_231.txt|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_232.txt|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p351_233.txt|We've never seen so many.
p351_234.txt|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351_235.txt|I am very, very happy.
p351_236.txt|The case was continued.
p351_237.txt|That is important for the club.
p351_238.txt|He is doing the right things.
p351_239.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p351_240.txt|Now he is in charge of this.
p351_241.txt|They want to play in the World Cup.
p351_242.txt|He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_243.txt|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p351_244.txt|The home team also had their moments.
p351_245.txt|Haven't been so lucky since.
p351_246.txt|He is under no illusions.
p351_247.txt|It got no better.
p351_248.txt|Some were close to tears.
p351_249.txt|It has become a way of life.
p351_250.txt|They seem to turn up for them.
p351_251.txt|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351_252.txt|Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351_253.txt|Now the show is for public consumption.
p351_254.txt|I want to create events.
p351_255.txt|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p351_256.txt|The old manager, he didn't like me.
p351_257.txt|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p351_258.txt|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_259.txt|It was like being in prison.
p351_260.txt|I think it was his parents.
p351_261.txt|That is very important to people.
p351_262.txt|I certainly hope not.
p351_263.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p351_264.txt|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_265.txt|There he goes again.
p351_266.txt|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p351_267.txt|I feel pretty good.
p351_268.txt|It's got to come from me.
p351_269.txt|There were moments of humour too.
p351_270.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p351_271.txt|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_272.txt|It happens from time to time.
p351_273.txt|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
p351_274.txt|They were too hard.
p351_275.txt|This is not a message from ministers.
p351_276.txt|We have been very patient.
p351_277.txt|I don't take that view.
p351_278.txt|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p351_279.txt|My only concern is for my children.
p351_280.txt|This is welcome news.
p351_281.txt|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351_282.txt|We just wish they had done so before.
p351_283.txt|It was a virus.
p351_284.txt|The rest, of course, is history.
p351_285.txt|They chose the latter.
p351_286.txt|That was not the norm.
p351_287.txt|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p351_288.txt|It is giving out the wrong message.
p351_289.txt|I feel it is very irrational.
p351_290.txt|We were used to being in control.
p351_291.txt|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_292.txt|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351_293.txt|It happened again, and again, and again.
p351_294.txt|Does it matter?
p351_295.txt|She thought she was going to die.
p351_296.txt|Were they under-age?
p351_297.txt|You are going to go to jail.
p351_298.txt|It is a very worrying report.
p351_299.txt|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p351_300.txt|My mind was made up.
p351_301.txt|It was an ongoing exercise.
p351_302.txt|I would love to see it back there.
p351_303.txt|He then did just that.
p351_304.txt|He should have won.
p351_305.txt|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351_306.txt|Who can predict?
p351_307.txt|It was all very proper and civilised.
p351_308.txt|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p351_309.txt|Then you see it.
p351_310.txt|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_311.txt|We don't believe anything anymore.
p351_312.txt|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p351_313.txt|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p351_314.txt|There is good quality.
p351_315.txt|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p351_316.txt|But these things are happening now.
p351_317.txt|He will be really pleased about this.
p351_318.txt|He had no access to the database.
p351_319.txt|They were not up to the required standard.
p351_320.txt|He also seems to have been around forever.
p351_321.txt|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p351_322.txt|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p351_323.txt|Others are expected to do so soon.
p351_324.txt|They were impressive against France.
p351_325.txt|Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351_326.txt|I played well but missed a few chances.
p351_327.txt|Our approach will be different.
p351_328.txt|It's my initial background.
p351_329.txt|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_330.txt|They're just a nonsense.
p351_331.txt|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p351_332.txt|He also called in at another farm.
p351_333.txt|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_334.txt|He will go a long way.
p351_335.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p351_336.txt|I lost a part of me.
p351_337.txt|It's so much more fun.
p351_338.txt|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_339.txt|It's getting to me.
p351_340.txt|So we talked about that for a bit.
p351_341.txt|But he has strong links to Labour.
p351_342.txt|I am proud of my team.
p351_343.txt|I am a doctor.
p351_344.txt|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p351_345.txt|It will carry on.
p351_346.txt|Our season is not over.
p351_347.txt|I am not retiring.
p351_348.txt|Money is not everything in life.
p351_349.txt|She kept him on a string.
p351_350.txt|It will make a big difference.
p351_351.txt|There was no basis for their arrest.
p351_352.txt|This latter suggestion is very important.
p351_353.txt|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351_354.txt|The Government has listened.
p351_355.txt|It's only tackling congestion.
p351_356.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351_357.txt|It's too horrible to think.
p351_358.txt|It can be frightening.
p351_359.txt|He was, but only just.
p351_360.txt|It may be his last for a while, too.
p351_361.txt|Further details are expected later.
p351_362.txt|What's wrong with that?
p351_363.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_364.txt|Off with their heads.
p351_365.txt|I believe she was elected unopposed.
p351_366.txt|We are not asking for the moon.
p351_367.txt|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_368.txt|The pain is still acute.
p351_369.txt|This was not the show for me.
p351_370.txt|It is a very big problem.
p351_371.txt|Frustration is not the word.
p351_372.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p351_373.txt|The cause is just.
p351_374.txt|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p351_375.txt|Our message is getting through.
p351_376.txt|But what lies ahead?
p351_377.txt|She makes me so happy.
p351_378.txt|They promised to fight the plans.
p351_379.txt|My heart is not so sure.
p351_380.txt|I am happy for her.
p351_381.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p351_382.txt|They were just too good for us.
p351_383.txt|He was the architect.
p351_384.txt|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p351_385.txt|It's a fantastic achievement.
p351_386.txt|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351_387.txt|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_388.txt|He, too, was not satisfied.
p351_389.txt|It's easy to see why.
p351_390.txt|But it didn't happen.
p351_391.txt|All were believed to be adults.
p351_392.txt|This is the last straw.
p351_393.txt|The research was my life.
p351_394.txt|I am so, so, so lucky.
p351_395.txt|What is it about this series?
p351_396.txt|You read it right.
p351_397.txt|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_398.txt|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p351_399.txt|Where does it come from?
p351_400.txt|You find it bizarre?
p351_401.txt|I am very excited about this season.
p351_402.txt|It has proved a double whammy.
p351_403.txt|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351_404.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p351_405.txt|But is he?
p351_406.txt|So it's a daily struggle.
p351_407.txt|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p351_408.txt|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p351_409.txt|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_410.txt|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_411.txt|You need a licence to run a pub.
p351_412.txt|Everything else is second.
p351_413.txt|I am not sure.
p351_414.txt|This is a successful outcome.
p351_415.txt|His first album was a hit.
p351_416.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p351_417.txt|The plane was shaking.
p351_418.txt|It was visibly on fire.
p351_419.txt|What's it for, after all?
p351_420.txt|We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_421.txt|A number of people could not speak English.
p351_422.txt|They have got off with murder.
p351_423.txt|I'm going to take it further.
p351_424.txt|I kept going for her.
p360_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p360_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p360_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p360_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p360_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p360_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p360_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p360_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p360_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p360_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p360_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p360_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p360_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p360_025.txt|You can never take a win for granted.
p360_026.txt|My conscience is not clear.
p360_027.txt|Is that it?
p360_028.txt|You have been warned.
p360_029.txt|You are not allowed to do that.
p360_030.txt|That depends on Rangers.
p360_031.txt|There are two problems.
p360_032.txt|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p360_033.txt|It's something which is very important to me.
p360_034.txt|For once he was wrong.
p360_035.txt|He would not have to explain.
p360_036.txt|I want to deliver a learning society.
p360_037.txt|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_038.txt|I had to be into it.
p360_039.txt|I'm so grateful for that.
p360_040.txt|It's not been a good year.
p360_041.txt|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p360_042.txt|I have no intention of resigning today.
p360_043.txt|That has now gone.
p360_044.txt|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_045.txt|This will take up to nine months.
p360_046.txt|And maybe they have.
p360_047.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p360_048.txt|Is he conscious?
p360_049.txt|But we are confident.
p360_050.txt|It is like a football team.
p360_051.txt|When he came to see me on Monday.
p360_052.txt|That's a concern to me.
p360_053.txt|She said she was really sorry.
p360_054.txt|That will be important.
p360_055.txt|But here it is also very bad.
p360_056.txt|That view has not altered.
p360_057.txt|It was very full anyway.
p360_058.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p360_059.txt|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_060.txt|But there is no easy option.
p360_061.txt|I can't believe she is dead.
p360_062.txt|No person was charged.
p360_063.txt|But it would say that.
p360_064.txt|Most of the works are small in scale.
p360_065.txt|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_066.txt|Only the bomber was killed.
p360_067.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p360_068.txt|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_069.txt|It was that kind of afternoon.
p360_070.txt|His presence was very important.
p360_071.txt|What happens next?
p360_072.txt|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_073.txt|The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_074.txt|That took two weeks.
p360_075.txt|It's worth it, though.
p360_076.txt|That perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_077.txt|I have to hand it to the bank.
p360_078.txt|The question was simple enough.
p360_079.txt|The voters rejected us.
p360_080.txt|There was a definite prejudice.
p360_081.txt|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_082.txt|We never publicise it.
p360_083.txt|You will be very welcome.
p360_084.txt|His musicals were very much of their time.
p360_085.txt|He became enchanted with the process.
p360_086.txt|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_087.txt|It seems very odd.
p360_088.txt|They couldn't keep it together.
p360_089.txt|We discovered that for ourselves.
p360_090.txt|We will continue to provide support for them.
p360_091.txt|I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_092.txt|It was looking bad.
p360_093.txt|That's what makes it interesting.
p360_094.txt|It's nice to be involved.
p360_095.txt|It's not a game.
p360_096.txt|Buildings are about people.
p360_097.txt|There is much work to do.
p360_098.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p360_099.txt|It was the dreaded sentence.
p360_100.txt|I have never considered it.
p360_101.txt|It is not in the public interest.
p360_102.txt|They had been forced to walk.
p360_103.txt|It is harder than you think.
p360_104.txt|The call was ignored.
p360_105.txt|I am looking forward to it.
p360_106.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p360_107.txt|That would be even more disastrous.
p360_108.txt|We opened up and everything was gone.
p360_109.txt|It is looking very special.
p360_110.txt|They offered to make an investment into it.
p360_111.txt|People were hitting the floor.
p360_112.txt|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_113.txt|They took a risk.
p360_114.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_115.txt|It has no place in football.
p360_116.txt|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_117.txt|This is a classic.
p360_118.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p360_119.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p360_120.txt|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_121.txt|They will run a mile.
p360_122.txt|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_123.txt|Britain has never had it so good.
p360_124.txt|So many people will be affected by this.
p360_125.txt|It was all very good stuff.
p360_126.txt|Or was it?
p360_127.txt|We are under no illusions about this.
p360_128.txt|But they are a good team.
p360_129.txt|We have a long way to go.
p360_130.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_131.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p360_132.txt|I knew that we needed to get out.
p360_133.txt|I had a train to catch.
p360_134.txt|And this game is all about belief.
p360_135.txt|I am ready for that.
p360_136.txt|It is a fantasy.
p360_137.txt|The only safe investment is cash.
p360_138.txt|That's the way they are.
p360_139.txt|Elections would follow in about two years.
p360_140.txt|We are trying to be realistic.
p360_141.txt|That was the theory.
p360_142.txt|Or so it seemed.
p360_143.txt|Now we look forward to it.
p360_144.txt|That was worth it.
p360_145.txt|What's it going to be then?
p360_146.txt|Who was being affected?
p360_147.txt|Our players are exhausted.
p360_148.txt|It is deeply frustrating.
p360_149.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_150.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360_151.txt|This has been carried out.
p360_152.txt|Our time is up.
p360_153.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p360_154.txt|But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360_155.txt|First meeting was next week.
p360_156.txt|No, we were not exactly favourites.
p360_157.txt|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_158.txt|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360_159.txt|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_160.txt|However, we will have to wait and see.
p360_161.txt|I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_162.txt|I don't know how they do it.
p360_163.txt|Little is known about them.
p360_164.txt|It is a new company for Scotland.
p360_165.txt|We're very unhappy about it.
p360_166.txt|A good actor doesn't think.
p360_167.txt|But the action is about to be restarted.
p360_168.txt|It was extremely difficult.
p360_169.txt|It is about the script for me.
p360_170.txt|I have a good feeling about this.
p360_171.txt|And the results were impressive.
p360_172.txt|The next game is today.
p360_173.txt|Hopefully it will be a good day.
p360_174.txt|I was a silly bastard.
p360_175.txt|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_176.txt|The process will start tomorrow.
p360_177.txt|Was the punishment excessive?
p360_178.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_179.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p360_180.txt|I could easy do that.
p360_181.txt|We are really impressed.
p360_182.txt|I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_183.txt|You have to wait.
p360_184.txt|I did not see anything to begin with.
p360_185.txt|It's their moment of choice.
p360_186.txt|I certainly do not agree with that.
p360_187.txt|It was a disaster of a race.
p360_188.txt|Only one person can claim the credit.
p360_189.txt|Maintain the highest standards.
p360_190.txt|What could we do?
p360_191.txt|O Neill has delivered.
p360_192.txt|But there was no going back.
p360_193.txt|There are some good people in there.
p360_194.txt|But it won't make a difference.
p360_195.txt|I'm not going to blame the band.
p360_196.txt|I think that he got the message.
p360_197.txt|Here it was very subdued.
p360_198.txt|Stardom is a funny thing.
p360_199.txt|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p360_200.txt|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_201.txt|I sincerely hope not.
p360_202.txt|I'm really looking forward to that.
p360_203.txt|She would say he was still the best.
p360_204.txt|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_205.txt|We didn't, and it worked for us.
p360_206.txt|No-one has used it since then.
p360_207.txt|The baby was dead.
p360_208.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p360_209.txt|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_210.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p360_211.txt|We should have no more problems.
p360_212.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360_213.txt|An announcement is expected soon.
p360_214.txt|It was one of those things.
p360_215.txt|I can understand that.
p360_216.txt|But sometimes it was even worse.
p360_217.txt|We had to work hard for it.
p360_218.txt|That's a big reduction.
p360_219.txt|There will be good prospects ahead.
p360_220.txt|I was pleased about that.
p360_221.txt|That has not changed.
p360_222.txt|It's a creative energy.
p360_223.txt|We are not conducting the review.
p360_224.txt|It just never comes together.
p360_225.txt|The club has never won it.
p360_226.txt|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_227.txt|So it was at Easter Road.
p360_228.txt|It will be a huge difference.
p360_229.txt|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_230.txt|The characters are always the first attraction.
p360_231.txt|We've got better players here.
p360_232.txt|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_233.txt|This is wonderful news.
p360_234.txt|So what's it all about?
p360_235.txt|I think he was lost for words.
p360_236.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p360_237.txt|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360_238.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p360_239.txt|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_240.txt|And what happens?
p360_241.txt|It is all very upbeat.
p360_242.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_243.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p360_244.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360_245.txt|We deserved the draw.
p360_246.txt|Just one of those things, we suppose.
p360_247.txt|It's up to the defence team.
p360_248.txt|No one was injured.
p360_249.txt|We have had our debate.
p360_250.txt|It is part of his game.
p360_251.txt|Did he just want to be on telly?
p360_252.txt|But it was too late.
p360_253.txt|I didn't see the point.
p360_254.txt|It seems a shame to leave it.
p360_255.txt|Who would have thought it?
p360_256.txt|They were all on a mission.
p360_257.txt|Human beings are always the same.
p360_258.txt|You will gain from that.
p360_259.txt|It makes me feel difficult.
p360_260.txt|We couldn't believe it at first.
p360_261.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360_262.txt|He could still be President.
p360_263.txt|It can take a long time.
p360_264.txt|I don't intend to do so now.
p360_265.txt|There is no answer to it.
p360_266.txt|He was pleased with his display.
p360_267.txt|The first time you read a play.
p360_268.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p360_269.txt|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p360_270.txt|He is having a nightmare.
p360_271.txt|That was six years ago.
p360_272.txt|Players have to accept this.
p360_273.txt|He is completely committed to us.
p360_274.txt|Neither had the public.
p360_275.txt|It disappeared into the cup.
p360_276.txt|They might well be right.
p360_277.txt|I have no further comment to make.
p360_278.txt|The warning is timely.
p360_279.txt|Those were the days.
p360_280.txt|The joint bid is still on course.
p360_281.txt|A press conference is about politics.
p360_282.txt|It was important to bring them all together.
p360_283.txt|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_284.txt|They tend to be female and retired.
p360_285.txt|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_286.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p360_287.txt|We know the fight is going to happen.
p360_288.txt|I have played well the past two days.
p360_289.txt|Is it on a building site?
p360_290.txt|That is the key.
p360_291.txt|We've been here before.
p360_292.txt|I am in a good position.
p360_293.txt|I have never been unemployed.
p360_294.txt|We are in it for the long-term.
p360_295.txt|But it didn't bother me.
p360_296.txt|I believe it will happen.
p360_297.txt|And Michael was just great.
p360_298.txt|He did it well.
p360_299.txt|Why have you decided to get married?
p360_300.txt|Is it all real?
p360_301.txt|He will be missed.
p360_302.txt|I would not descend to that level.
p360_303.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p360_304.txt|We will not tolerate it.
p360_305.txt|I'm really proud of her.
p360_306.txt|What does this mean?
p360_307.txt|They are not falling now.
p360_308.txt|We are not physical at all.
p360_309.txt|Have we not been here before?
p360_310.txt|I've been waiting a long time.
p360_311.txt|The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_312.txt|You just have to get on with it.
p360_313.txt|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_314.txt|And that match was played in June.
p360_315.txt|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360_316.txt|I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_317.txt|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360_318.txt|I have learned a lot.
p360_319.txt|It won't be their last.
p360_320.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p360_321.txt|He has yet to receive a reply.
p360_322.txt|It has been only average.
p360_323.txt|He should be worried about me.
p360_324.txt|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p360_325.txt|For me, any manager is good.
p360_326.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_327.txt|That was the gimmick.
p360_328.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p360_329.txt|He has changed my life forever.
p360_330.txt|I have no idea.
p360_331.txt|This plan is all about respect.
p360_332.txt|I don't think he played his best.
p360_333.txt|Pakistan denied the report.
p360_334.txt|It will be up to the government.
p360_335.txt|That is a tragedy.
p360_336.txt|I am very happy.
p360_337.txt|A child is not a product.
p360_338.txt|But this is nonsense.
p360_339.txt|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360_340.txt|I'm going to miss it.
p360_341.txt|There will be no backing down.
p360_342.txt|The atmosphere was excellent.
p360_343.txt|That must have had an effect.
p360_344.txt|They have brought in the replacement.
p360_345.txt|How did it all come about?
p360_346.txt|We are working so hard.
p360_347.txt|One was a lawyer.
p360_348.txt|Our position is extremely simple.
p360_349.txt|Where did that finish?
p360_350.txt|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_351.txt|The most important thing was to win today.
p360_352.txt|Golf is not like that.
p360_353.txt|This is a moment to seize.
p360_354.txt|I would not do that.
p360_355.txt|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360_356.txt|They said that they stood by their statement.
p360_357.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360_358.txt|That has to be allowed.
p360_359.txt|He has never let them down.
p360_360.txt|There was no-one of the required standard.
p360_361.txt|That would be very good for Rangers.
p360_362.txt|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p360_363.txt|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_364.txt|That gives it a spirit.
p360_365.txt|She has never been back.
p360_366.txt|It will set the tone.
p360_367.txt|They are not going away.
p360_368.txt|Having done it, he was asked again.
p360_369.txt|I think he will.
p360_370.txt|The package is a changing one.
p360_371.txt|I'm working on that one, too.
p360_372.txt|Frankly, that's not good enough.
p360_373.txt|Or is it?
p360_374.txt|What's the difference?
p360_375.txt|The whole family was in shock.
p360_376.txt|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_377.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p360_378.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p360_379.txt|It meant a lot to us.
p360_380.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p360_381.txt|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p360_382.txt|This country has many challenges.
p360_383.txt|Their families are gone.
p360_384.txt|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p360_385.txt|I didn't do it.
p360_386.txt|They are with their father.
p360_387.txt|They're all doing it.
p360_388.txt|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_389.txt|No, they are not the same thing.
p360_390.txt|In football it is not always the case.
p360_391.txt|Sometimes we find a person.
p360_392.txt|It is a natural reaction.
p360_393.txt|I am in a very difficult position.
p360_394.txt|I had to win this race.
p360_395.txt|They could have been told in advance.
p360_396.txt|And what do we have?
p360_397.txt|It is a relief.
p360_398.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p360_399.txt|These were the edited highlights.
p360_400.txt|That is the difference.
p360_401.txt|You will need it.
p360_402.txt|There is so much at stake.
p360_403.txt|It has great potential.
p360_404.txt|They had three children.
p360_405.txt|It was all too little, too late.
p360_406.txt|Still, it is a very good result for us.
p360_407.txt|And he's not alone.
p360_408.txt|What was all that about?
p360_409.txt|What's the problem with change?
p360_410.txt|I intend to end it on a high.
p360_411.txt|What she can't have is the money.
p360_412.txt|I thought they played well.
p360_413.txt|This is not the end.
p360_414.txt|And they went on to win the title.
p360_415.txt|Now, she will not be running at all.
p360_416.txt|It's not an impression.
p360_417.txt|This was great for our sport.
p360_418.txt|There's no place to hide.
p360_419.txt|I don't think they are too serious.
p360_420.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p360_421.txt|There was no happy ending.
p360_422.txt|They need time to think.
p360_423.txt|It's unfair on her.
p360_424.txt|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p361_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p361_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p361_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p361_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p361_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p361_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p361_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p361_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p361_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p361_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p361_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p361_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p361_025.txt|Something has to be done.
p361_026.txt|That is where the damage has been done.
p361_027.txt|He may not need to force that message.
p361_028.txt|These decisions are not simple.
p361_029.txt|The results were very clear.
p361_030.txt|We must convince the citizens.
p361_031.txt|I decided it is going to be William.
p361_032.txt|But we need to keep it there.
p361_033.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p361_034.txt|I am really ready for it now.
p361_035.txt|He was jailed for four years.
p361_036.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p361_037.txt|This decision is folly.
p361_038.txt|And this was well known?
p361_039.txt|It took two minutes to respond.
p361_040.txt|Why you did it will never be known.
p361_041.txt|He was in his element.
p361_042.txt|That means an extra two years.
p361_043.txt|So, we have to go back.
p361_044.txt|I'm sure he does.
p361_045.txt|He was found again almost a year later.
p361_046.txt|The answer was wrong.
p361_047.txt|They need to be helped.
p361_048.txt|It is all starting to come together.
p361_049.txt|I am the fastest player on the course.
p361_050.txt|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_051.txt|They were taken to prove a point.
p361_052.txt|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361_053.txt|It is an important step forward.
p361_054.txt|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_055.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p361_056.txt|That is the way it is.
p361_057.txt|That was something else.
p361_058.txt|This resulted in the following.
p361_059.txt|I want to deal with this stuff.
p361_060.txt|We will be patient but we will win.
p361_061.txt|As good as they come.
p361_062.txt|It is not for me to say.
p361_063.txt|For that much we must be grateful.
p361_064.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p361_065.txt|I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_066.txt|But we are very near.
p361_067.txt|Nobody else is at risk.
p361_068.txt|We are not going to back off.
p361_069.txt|He said it was for sale.
p361_070.txt|We have a strong team at the moment.
p361_071.txt|This is a dream come true.
p361_072.txt|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361_073.txt|It is on the news.
p361_074.txt|They said there was nothing.
p361_075.txt|They were looking for things.
p361_076.txt|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361_077.txt|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_078.txt|As it should be.
p361_079.txt|We have never been short of volunteers.
p361_080.txt|But who is it?
p361_081.txt|Kenny Miller might come through.
p361_082.txt|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_083.txt|It just isn't there.
p361_084.txt|Drama is not one of them.
p361_085.txt|And we have a singer.
p361_086.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p361_087.txt|This is a personal decision for me.
p361_088.txt|It's just a failing service.
p361_089.txt|We all want to be left alone.
p361_090.txt|I was saying, No.
p361_091.txt|Where are they?
p361_092.txt|I am delighted to hear this news.
p361_093.txt|I knew him a little.
p361_094.txt|They just have a go.
p361_095.txt|If it's going in, it goes in.
p361_096.txt|Nobody called me to explain.
p361_097.txt|You didn't get a modified.
p361_098.txt|What kind of person is he?
p361_099.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p361_100.txt|What has changed since then?
p361_101.txt|He knows he is good.
p361_102.txt|I welcome the decision.
p361_103.txt|It could take some time.
p361_104.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361_105.txt|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361_106.txt|I've done a lot in that building.
p361_107.txt|Music is all consuming.
p361_108.txt|The results are very positive.
p361_109.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361_110.txt|Which is where we come in.
p361_111.txt|I'm not looking forward to it.
p361_112.txt|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p361_113.txt|He is a pro.
p361_114.txt|They have to tell it as it is.
p361_115.txt|This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_116.txt|You should enjoy the day.
p361_117.txt|He was taken ill in his office.
p361_118.txt|We couldn't get enough of it.
p361_119.txt|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p361_120.txt|I am not very pleased.
p361_121.txt|It is just a statement of fact.
p361_122.txt|It was on my mind a little bit.
p361_123.txt|I will just have to be patient.
p361_124.txt|I didn't think about it again.
p361_125.txt|And if they fail?
p361_126.txt|He has gone through the process before.
p361_127.txt|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p361_128.txt|We've always had something to do.
p361_129.txt|How do you take them away?
p361_130.txt|It will be released in October.
p361_132.txt|That got me out.
p361_133.txt|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p361_134.txt|It's a matter for the Committee.
p361_135.txt|It will have to ratify the deal.
p361_136.txt|I've never seen anything like it.
p361_137.txt|It was highly successful.
p361_138.txt|We needed someone and we now have him.
p361_139.txt|It has to find out what went wrong.
p361_140.txt|Only one was from Glasgow.
p361_141.txt|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_142.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p361_143.txt|They received no money under the merger.
p361_144.txt|It was a big departure.
p361_145.txt|She has never mentioned it.
p361_146.txt|I want my mum.
p361_147.txt|It seems to have been an own goal.
p361_148.txt|Or someone wants to say something different.
p361_149.txt|There are no second chances.
p361_150.txt|And it was great for me.
p361_151.txt|I am extremely sad.
p361_152.txt|This series is for real.
p361_153.txt|It has still to be recovered.
p361_154.txt|The conclusion is the same.
p361_155.txt|I wish they would commit to us.
p361_156.txt|The driver just insulted me.
p361_157.txt|Something has to be put in place.
p361_158.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p361_159.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p361_160.txt|That is the sensible outcome.
p361_161.txt|You can see the appeal of running away.
p361_162.txt|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_163.txt|That comes at a cost.
p361_164.txt|And so did the rest of her team.
p361_165.txt|He tells the truth and that's important.
p361_166.txt|Those are difficult decisions.
p361_167.txt|The omens are not good.
p361_168.txt|The game was there to be won.
p361_169.txt|Then there's the casting.
p361_170.txt|There is no signature.
p361_171.txt|We can't go on like this.
p361_172.txt|It is a very demanding course.
p361_173.txt|Can he do it?
p361_174.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p361_175.txt|I've won the British.
p361_176.txt|If they wish to go, they can go.
p361_177.txt|However, it was a different story in the final.
p361_178.txt|I was just aghast.
p361_179.txt|They get money for it now.
p361_180.txt|I could have been offended.
p361_181.txt|That's not the way to think.
p361_182.txt|I can see it now.
p361_183.txt|Then everyone must consider their future.
p361_184.txt|There was nothing she could do.
p361_185.txt|We want to be part of it.
p361_186.txt|It was a bit of a shock.
p361_187.txt|It's not long enough.
p361_188.txt|This is positive and welcome.
p361_189.txt|Now he is back on top again.
p361_190.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p361_191.txt|Anything less will not do.
p361_192.txt|Failure is not an option.
p361_193.txt|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_194.txt|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_195.txt|You look at that.
p361_196.txt|They will be very physical.
p361_197.txt|It has been well worth it.
p361_198.txt|It was just a feeling.
p361_199.txt|People are trying to run away.
p361_200.txt|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
p361_201.txt|This is clearly not abuse.
p361_202.txt|He should be careful.
p361_203.txt|Everyone knew the family.
p361_204.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p361_205.txt|Translation - we got it wrong.
p361_206.txt|We will be working on that this week, all right.
p361_207.txt|These are serious matters.
p361_208.txt|The pace is telling.
p361_209.txt|She has always been very friendly.
p361_210.txt|Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_211.txt|It is his script.
p361_212.txt|I am a socialist.
p361_213.txt|The response was really good.
p361_214.txt|The squad is too small.
p361_215.txt|You can blame the defence.
p361_216.txt|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_217.txt|It just could be a good night.
p361_218.txt|But we were wrong.
p361_219.txt|This has gone on too long.
p361_220.txt|It is an outrage.
p361_221.txt|It is a performance.
p361_222.txt|It is the best place.
p361_223.txt|We tried to get them down.
p361_224.txt|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361_225.txt|I don't know the full story.
p361_226.txt|Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361_227.txt|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p361_228.txt|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361_229.txt|I just want him to win a tournament.
p361_230.txt|Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_231.txt|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p361_232.txt|I will never see my son again.
p361_233.txt|But it is being pursued.
p361_234.txt|He knew they were there.
p361_235.txt|That would end it for us.
p361_236.txt|We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_237.txt|It attracted no complaints.
p361_238.txt|Neil is never going to come back.
p361_239.txt|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361_240.txt|Four of the victims were women.
p361_241.txt|He was also very happy to listen.
p361_242.txt|It's to do with this place.
p361_243.txt|It's a technical demand.
p361_244.txt|Sadly it is a mess.
p361_245.txt|That has to take its toll.
p361_246.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p361_247.txt|But those days are dead and gone.
p361_248.txt|However we must not be complacent.
p361_249.txt|And that was just the start.
p361_250.txt|Nothing was meant by it.
p361_251.txt|That was my last game.
p361_252.txt|Colour is another problem.
p361_253.txt|It is not just the agencies.
p361_254.txt|It came in bits and pieces.
p361_255.txt|You don't see that.
p361_256.txt|They seem to be, anyway.
p361_257.txt|I thought they were just excited.
p361_258.txt|He will appear in court today.
p361_259.txt|Or is he?
p361_260.txt|Was he confident about his prospects?
p361_261.txt|What can you do?
p361_262.txt|It's been very difficult.
p361_263.txt|Do something that we need.
p361_264.txt|There is no other offer on the table.
p361_265.txt|When she returned, it was a wreck.
p361_266.txt|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_267.txt|It is difficult to say.
p361_268.txt|He is not the only one.
p361_269.txt|We call it marriage.
p361_270.txt|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361_271.txt|It's not the tour.
p361_272.txt|So what is the secret of the success?
p361_273.txt|My husband was fighting for his life.
p361_274.txt|So was the first half.
p361_275.txt|It is still under discussion with the board.
p361_276.txt|That is one point of view.
p361_277.txt|We are in this for the long haul.
p361_278.txt|Here we go then.
p361_279.txt|No reason was given.
p361_280.txt|I can't wait for it to come out.
p361_281.txt|I am really sorry that he is going.
p361_282.txt|Indeed, that has already begun.
p361_283.txt|But it's the truth.
p361_284.txt|We have been here before.
p361_285.txt|And he did that.
p361_286.txt|And she is very clear on this.
p361_287.txt|His remarks were disgraceful.
p361_288.txt|I did not think it was very proper.
p361_289.txt|I have really noticed that this week.
p361_290.txt|In a way he was.
p361_291.txt|I will never forget that.
p361_292.txt|It was considered to be topical.
p361_293.txt|Well, that's all right then.
p361_294.txt|No-one is a winner in this.
p361_295.txt|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p361_296.txt|What do you think?
p361_297.txt|They went back to the seventeenth.
p361_298.txt|If we don't do it, someone else will.
p361_299.txt|Again, there was no detail.
p361_300.txt|Let the voters decide.
p361_301.txt|Then it will come.
p361_302.txt|It should be easy.
p361_303.txt|Is it worth it?
p361_304.txt|I will build a house on the site.
p361_305.txt|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p361_306.txt|I do my job.
p361_307.txt|They have to get that sorted.
p361_308.txt|That is a dangerous assumption.
p361_309.txt|Does it make a profit?
p361_310.txt|I think it's a good sign.
p361_311.txt|A winter of discontent awaits.
p361_312.txt|I knew him well.
p361_313.txt|I am not ready to walk away.
p361_314.txt|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_315.txt|They are already there.
p361_316.txt|I'd never given up on myself.
p361_317.txt|The concerns were unfounded.
p361_318.txt|It doesn't look good for her.
p361_319.txt|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p361_320.txt|I have some comments.
p361_321.txt|You have to be realistic.
p361_322.txt|There was nowhere for him to go.
p361_323.txt|Not that he was complaining.
p361_324.txt|We are very proud of him.
p361_325.txt|There they were, making excuses for him.
p361_326.txt|It just got out of control.
p361_327.txt|Every case is completely different.
p361_328.txt|It's all about unfinished business.
p361_329.txt|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361_330.txt|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
p361_331.txt|It will be fine.
p361_332.txt|Yet the job is far from over.
p361_333.txt|He has a point.
p361_334.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p361_335.txt|It is our other home.
p361_336.txt|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
p361_337.txt|What a difference a game can make.
p361_338.txt|It is their day.
p361_339.txt|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
p361_340.txt|They are used to it.
p361_341.txt|And we are doing it.
p361_342.txt|It's just not good enough.
p361_343.txt|I have a cold.
p361_344.txt|You've got to hand it to them.
p361_345.txt|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
p361_346.txt|It was his own decision.
p361_347.txt|This is still happening in the US.
p361_348.txt|And that was the real problem.
p361_349.txt|But then the problems began.
p361_350.txt|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p361_351.txt|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361_352.txt|The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_353.txt|That there would be discussions.
p361_354.txt|It must not happen.
p361_355.txt|That would be unsafe.
p361_356.txt|I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_357.txt|We had no idea what was going on.
p361_358.txt|If only it had been.
p361_359.txt|So far, it is no more.
p361_360.txt|Seven people were critically injured.
p361_361.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p361_362.txt|He could have given them a lot.
p361_363.txt|It was up to him.
p361_364.txt|It's going to happen.
p361_365.txt|I don't think so.
p361_366.txt|And that was just about that.
p361_367.txt|By hard work, is the answer.
p361_368.txt|It is really special to me.
p361_369.txt|This is a major step forward.
p361_370.txt|They haven't got the uniform.
p361_371.txt|Well, you don't have time.
p361_372.txt|It is very funny.
p361_373.txt|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_374.txt|This is good news for the industry.
p361_375.txt|There are no quick fixes.
p361_376.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p361_377.txt|What do we have to do?
p361_378.txt|I have never seen anything like it.
p361_379.txt|It's about New Yorkers.
p361_380.txt|That was a real challenge.
p361_381.txt|They will give it a couple of years.
p361_382.txt|He certainly would have approved.
p361_383.txt|Conditions were less than ideal.
p361_384.txt|We want this place to work.
p361_385.txt|Father is on the train.
p361_386.txt|It could have been prevented.
p361_387.txt|We have been going for three years.
p361_388.txt|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
p361_389.txt|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p361_390.txt|It is planned for London in the spring.
p361_391.txt|Everything is coming together well.
p361_392.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p361_393.txt|But we are not afraid of them.
p361_394.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p361_395.txt|That will be the criteria for the future.
p361_396.txt|They thought they couldn't get any.
p361_397.txt|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p361_398.txt|I am delighted to have her back home.
p361_399.txt|This idea is a good starting point.
p361_400.txt|She had denied the charge.
p361_401.txt|It was cynical and callous.
p361_402.txt|It's a dead end.
p361_403.txt|What sort of man is that?
p361_404.txt|The message was clear.
p361_405.txt|We are going nowhere.
p361_406.txt|It is truly masterly performance.
p361_407.txt|She failed to win any of them.
p361_408.txt|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p361_409.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p361_410.txt|It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_411.txt|I found that we couldn't.
p361_412.txt|He is very sensitive.
p361_413.txt|That can benefit the larger companies.
p361_414.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p361_415.txt|We told them in July.
p361_416.txt|This was a very tragic accident.
p361_417.txt|We are very, very confident.
p361_418.txt|It is a result we should savour.
p361_419.txt|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361_420.txt|We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_421.txt|My life is going to go on.
p361_422.txt|It's really part of our mission.
p361_423.txt|That was only the start.
p361_424.txt|But what took them so long?
p362_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p362_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p362_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p362_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p362_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p362_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p362_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p362_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p362_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p362_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p362_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p362_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p362_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p362_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p362_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p362_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p362_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p362_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p362_025.txt|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p362_026.txt|This is your country.
p362_027.txt|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362_028.txt|I feel really good.
p362_029.txt|It was a fairy tale.
p362_030.txt|But there are no plans.
p362_031.txt|They responded in the most positive way.
p362_032.txt|I have a very strong opinion about this.
p362_033.txt|The British government said she was coming home.
p362_034.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p362_035.txt|His mother was English.
p362_036.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p362_037.txt|It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362_038.txt|Was this a new event?
p362_039.txt|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p362_040.txt|They had a confession.
p362_041.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p362_042.txt|The chances were plentiful.
p362_043.txt|They were impressive against France.
p362_044.txt|This is only one example.
p362_045.txt|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p362_046.txt|The cause is just.
p362_047.txt|I am so upset.
p362_048.txt|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p362_049.txt|They finished second and third.
p362_050.txt|But this was refused.
p362_051.txt|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p362_052.txt|Hasn't let anyone down?
p362_053.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p362_054.txt|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_055.txt|He is one of them.
p362_056.txt|This was no accident.
p362_057.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p362_058.txt|It is a sign of hope.
p362_059.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p362_060.txt|They're interested only in profits.
p362_061.txt|And there has been a good start.
p362_062.txt|I feel my parents are in New York.
p362_063.txt|Policing the profession is important.
p362_064.txt|Seems a sensible compromise.
p362_065.txt|She had no chance.
p362_066.txt|In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
p362_067.txt|I don't have a problem with it.
p362_068.txt|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362_069.txt|It's more relaxing this way.
p362_070.txt|Allison is not convinced.
p362_071.txt|We have to move forward from now on.
p362_072.txt|And it was this one.
p362_073.txt|I am going to win the next two.
p362_074.txt|She's afraid of life.
p362_075.txt|But there is good and bad.
p362_076.txt|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p362_077.txt|That is her job.
p362_078.txt|They have broken that promise.
p362_079.txt|I don't know what it means.
p362_080.txt|I found the course inspiring.
p362_081.txt|I have to accept that.
p362_082.txt|It means the margin for error is tight.
p362_083.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p362_084.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p362_085.txt|It is not a road of life.
p362_086.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p362_087.txt|One is investment, one is reform.
p362_088.txt|They could not have done more for me.
p362_089.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p362_090.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p362_091.txt|It's not my fault.
p362_092.txt|My husband was angry.
p362_093.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p362_094.txt|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p362_095.txt|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p362_096.txt|They have to work so hard.
p362_097.txt|Well, was it?
p362_098.txt|I thought he was my friend.
p362_099.txt|What kind of person is he?
p362_100.txt|There's a strong involvement.
p362_101.txt|This is complete nonsense.
p362_102.txt|This Government is cutting taxes.
p362_103.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362_104.txt|They know their son was murdered.
p362_105.txt|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p362_106.txt|So is that it, then?
p362_107.txt|The task is enormous.
p362_108.txt|I know he meant it.
p362_109.txt|A, The media has been great.
p362_110.txt|There have been so many.
p362_111.txt|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p362_112.txt|Of course, it is nonsense.
p362_113.txt|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p362_114.txt|He had returned to die.
p362_115.txt|Anyone can take a photo.
p362_116.txt|He is involved in everything.
p362_117.txt|No person was charged.
p362_118.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p362_119.txt|He's a nice guy.
p362_120.txt|The fire was still coming down.
p362_121.txt|It's always the way.
p362_122.txt|I got the surprise of my life.
p362_123.txt|It will be tight.
p362_124.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p362_125.txt|Both are national treasures.
p362_126.txt|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p362_127.txt|Well, you don't have time.
p362_128.txt|I had never done anything like it before.
p362_129.txt|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p362_130.txt|But he thought the overall results were good.
p362_131.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p362_132.txt|I had been hoping for justice.
p362_133.txt|Labour is providing none of these.
p362_134.txt|The building was starting to come down.
p362_135.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p362_136.txt|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p362_137.txt|There is a subtle difference.
p362_138.txt|He has created the confusion.
p362_139.txt|He didn't get out much.
p362_140.txt|She was very different.
p362_141.txt|That is my dream.
p362_142.txt|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p362_143.txt|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
p362_144.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p362_145.txt|The choice is simple.
p362_146.txt|Who is going to pay their wages?
p362_147.txt|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_148.txt|It was that kind of match.
p362_149.txt|We couldn't believe it at first.
p362_150.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p362_151.txt|I have nothing to regret.
p362_152.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p362_153.txt|A century on, little has changed.
p362_154.txt|Wrong decisions Address in full
p362_155.txt|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p362_156.txt|He is having a nightmare.
p362_157.txt|And he still is.
p362_158.txt|However, the story has a happy ending.
p362_159.txt|You never had it so good.
p362_160.txt|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p362_161.txt|Then he did it twice.
p362_162.txt|So is the rest of British sport.
p362_163.txt|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p362_164.txt|It was his greatest movie performance.
p362_165.txt|We go back a long way.
p362_166.txt|So, easy does it.
p362_167.txt|Not that he's declined.
p362_168.txt|People also have trouble with the currency.
p362_169.txt|I always wanted her to be happy.
p362_170.txt|We've got to get back to normal.
p362_171.txt|Do we want to see it?
p362_172.txt|That is for certain.
p362_173.txt|An inquiry has begun.
p362_174.txt|I was a little surprised.
p362_175.txt|That is not, however, the case.
p362_176.txt|Only two players have done it.
p362_177.txt|He is a master of deceit and delay.
p362_178.txt|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p362_179.txt|What was that all about?
p362_180.txt|This is a fine appointment.
p362_181.txt|That was the finest moment in my career.
p362_182.txt|England will be quite prepared.
p362_183.txt|He is appealing to women.
p362_184.txt|There is no conflict of interest.
p362_185.txt|She has the biggest part.
p362_186.txt|Film music was never the same again.
p362_187.txt|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p362_188.txt|I thought he was at fault.
p362_189.txt|The First Minister is an addict.
p362_190.txt|We will win this tie.
p362_191.txt|I think he's done it a few times.
p362_192.txt|Something happened on that island.
p362_193.txt|This is a business.
p362_194.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p362_195.txt|I never had any real direction at school.
p362_196.txt|That's how it works.
p362_197.txt|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
p362_198.txt|Do what you want to do.
p362_199.txt|We know the quality of life goes up.
p362_200.txt|Who are the public?
p362_201.txt|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p362_203.txt|But we have learned that it doesn't.
p362_204.txt|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p362_205.txt|They should not be blamed for it.
p362_206.txt|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p362_207.txt|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
p362_208.txt|It was crucial strike.
p362_209.txt|I have no secrets.
p362_210.txt|What do you want to say?
p362_211.txt|I was so relieved.
p362_212.txt|They continue to do so.
p362_213.txt|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362_214.txt|It is a worry.
p362_215.txt|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p362_216.txt|That is highly unfair.
p362_217.txt|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p362_218.txt|Gas is too expensive.
p362_219.txt|This plan is an agenda for action.
p362_220.txt|It was all relative.
p362_221.txt|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p362_222.txt|Are you up for business?
p362_223.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p362_224.txt|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_225.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p362_226.txt|Life becomes a song.
p362_227.txt|No wonder he missed the conversion.
p362_228.txt|Sadly, they did not.
p362_229.txt|We have nowhere to go.
p362_230.txt|He has every right to do that.
p362_231.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p362_232.txt|That had never happened.
p362_233.txt|However, our players will fight for that.
p362_234.txt|They are not suitable.
p362_235.txt|He is advised that he has done so.
p362_236.txt|You mean he didn't get the girl?
p362_237.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p362_238.txt|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p362_239.txt|But the killing will continue.
p362_240.txt|They've got to get better.
p362_241.txt|But we are working together for this result.
p362_242.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p362_243.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p362_244.txt|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p362_245.txt|The most important thing is the game.
p362_246.txt|He said nothing of the sort.
p362_247.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p362_248.txt|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
p362_249.txt|The door is open.
p362_250.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p362_251.txt|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p362_252.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p362_253.txt|So what went wrong?
p362_254.txt|We did not play well.
p362_255.txt|We are in a very strong position.
p362_256.txt|This will have no effect on the championship.
p362_257.txt|That is the key.
p362_258.txt|So, how did you do?
p362_259.txt|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p362_260.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p362_261.txt|I can't deny that fact.
p362_262.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p362_263.txt|We could have done without this.
p362_264.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p362_265.txt|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p362_266.txt|He's a great dealer.
p362_267.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p362_268.txt|I want to concentrate on the real issues.
p362_269.txt|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p362_270.txt|We are moving on.
p362_271.txt|This is not a crisis.
p362_272.txt|There's always a chance.
p362_273.txt|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p362_274.txt|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p362_275.txt|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p362_276.txt|That's a very serious matter.
p362_277.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p362_278.txt|But it was to no avail.
p362_279.txt|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
p362_280.txt|It has been a major success.
p362_281.txt|It takes a bit of working out.
p362_282.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p362_283.txt|But it didn't bother me.
p362_284.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p362_285.txt|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
p362_286.txt|He will not be coming back.
p362_287.txt|He is also a great finisher.
p362_288.txt|I don't see any problem.
p362_289.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p362_290.txt|Yet it seemed to work.
p362_291.txt|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_292.txt|I have never felt so well.
p362_293.txt|There are other things going on.
p362_294.txt|All is now forgiven.
p362_295.txt|So who is right?
p362_296.txt|And this tournament will travel.
p362_297.txt|There will be new memories.
p362_298.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p362_299.txt|We know the goals will come.
p362_300.txt|How can they get one?
p362_301.txt|It was an insult.
p362_302.txt|But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_303.txt|We have nothing to hide.
p362_304.txt|He added, We are full of anger.
p362_305.txt|He did it all for us.
p362_306.txt|I don't think that is good enough.
p362_307.txt|Of course it is.
p362_308.txt|We all make mistakes.
p362_309.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p362_310.txt|That is my commitment.
p362_311.txt|This is the only problem with the story.
p362_312.txt|It is good football in Scotland.
p362_313.txt|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p362_314.txt|Is that right?
p362_315.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p362_316.txt|They should be so lucky.
p362_317.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362_318.txt|It is good news for us.
p362_319.txt|The timing is obvious.
p362_320.txt|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p362_321.txt|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p362_322.txt|I don't think it's very real.
p362_323.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362_324.txt|I think she was right.
p362_325.txt|Is that what people want?
p362_326.txt|CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
p362_327.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p362_328.txt|It will be a new experience.
p362_329.txt|The process itself has taken over.
p362_330.txt|She asked for the appointment with me.
p362_331.txt|The time commitment is the biggest thing.
p362_332.txt|It is quite hard to track.
p362_333.txt|It's not going to last five minutes.
p362_334.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p362_335.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p362_336.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p362_337.txt|It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_338.txt|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p362_339.txt|Doesn't matter what you do.
p362_340.txt|O no it's not!
p362_341.txt|The result could be all down to turnout.
p362_342.txt|They are in good spirits.
p362_343.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p362_344.txt|He was their leader.
p362_345.txt|The support of Britain is assumed.
p362_346.txt|So far he has not done so.
p362_347.txt|Maybe they will show it next year.
p362_348.txt|They are a very good team.
p362_349.txt|So there we are.
p362_350.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p362_351.txt|It doesn't make me feel any better.
p362_352.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p362_353.txt|The incident is dead.
p362_354.txt|We are delighted with the result.
p362_355.txt|It will take time.
p362_356.txt|They will do something big.
p362_357.txt|The programme was awful.
p362_358.txt|It is having a big impact.
p362_359.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p362_360.txt|I am feeling on top of the world.
p362_361.txt|Doesn't he miss it?
p362_362.txt|The same goes for Russia.
p362_363.txt|They went down together.
p362_364.txt|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p362_365.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p362_366.txt|We were getting very worried.
p362_367.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p362_368.txt|You can't really compare.
p362_369.txt|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p362_370.txt|Plot is not the issue.
p362_371.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p362_372.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p362_373.txt|We should not be complacent.
p362_374.txt|We all want the same things.
p362_375.txt|Maybe his time has gone.
p362_376.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p362_377.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p362_378.txt|SO, that is it for another year.
p362_379.txt|The results are tragic.
p362_380.txt|We are not getting him back.
p362_381.txt|He was on a horse.
p362_382.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p362_383.txt|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p362_384.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p362_385.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p362_386.txt|It's a good offer by any standards.
p362_387.txt|Yes, it took time to recover.
p362_388.txt|The potential is always in the idea.
p362_389.txt|I am not a frustrated actor.
p362_390.txt|No progress has been made.
p362_391.txt|He can win every week.
p362_392.txt|This makes up for it.
p362_393.txt|My mind was made up.
p362_394.txt|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p362_395.txt|I never got anything out of it.
p362_396.txt|It is patently true.
p362_397.txt|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362_398.txt|But don't just take my word, for it.
p362_399.txt|That is why he is so special.
p362_400.txt|You hope he prevails.
p362_401.txt|My mother was getting on at me.
p362_402.txt|This is a very serious matter.
p362_403.txt|It's going to be great!
p362_404.txt|That's a good sign.
p362_405.txt|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p362_406.txt|He added that he felt undermined.
p362_407.txt|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p362_408.txt|He declined to be more specific.
p362_409.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p362_410.txt|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362_411.txt|We want everyone to have a good time.
p362_412.txt|We're going to rebuild.
p362_413.txt|We are trying to do it properly.
p362_414.txt|We actually had a laugh about that.
p362_415.txt|It raises the edge.
p362_416.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p362_417.txt|I had no idea.
p362_418.txt|As indeed it did.
p362_419.txt|We made a world record together.
p362_420.txt|They were outside the circle.
p362_421.txt|I want to help other women.
p362_422.txt|He got the part.
p362_423.txt|Or, rather, it isn't.
p362_424.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p363_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p363_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p363_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p363_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p363_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p363_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p363_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p363_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p363_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p363_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p363_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p363_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p363_025.txt|It's never been to committee.
p363_026.txt|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363_027.txt|It was actually very, very difficult.
p363_028.txt|The proposals were not new.
p363_029.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_030.txt|His party never arrived.
p363_031.txt|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_032.txt|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p363_033.txt|He gave no other details.
p363_034.txt|It's not an improvement for him.
p363_035.txt|I think it is wide open.
p363_036.txt|It certainly is cause for concern.
p363_037.txt|It's on with a roller.
p363_038.txt|The captaincy will help that, too.
p363_039.txt|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_040.txt|I think we're a long way forward.
p363_041.txt|The impact was immediate.
p363_042.txt|There is a new confidence about the club.
p363_043.txt|His film is not.
p363_044.txt|It is the strength of the school.
p363_045.txt|In my experience, he does not do that.
p363_046.txt|That is good news.
p363_047.txt|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_048.txt|He will never be forgotten.
p363_049.txt|I was not overly concerned about this.
p363_050.txt|He was very grateful for his health.
p363_051.txt|The nation has his music.
p363_052.txt|But real life is not like that.
p363_053.txt|So now we know.
p363_054.txt|That is why this action has been taken.
p363_055.txt|Who will pay for this?
p363_056.txt|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_057.txt|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_058.txt|We were upset about the referee.
p363_059.txt|That is our objective.
p363_060.txt|What's the problem?
p363_061.txt|He is not alone.
p363_062.txt|He did that last Sunday.
p363_063.txt|There wasn't anything in it.
p363_064.txt|The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_065.txt|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_066.txt|Lovely day isn't it?
p363_067.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p363_068.txt|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_069.txt|The show is not over.
p363_070.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p363_071.txt|This is a judgment issue.
p363_072.txt|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p363_073.txt|It was just an accident.
p363_074.txt|We are not commenting at the moment.
p363_075.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_076.txt|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_077.txt|He is slightly confused.
p363_078.txt|We did not deserve to go through.
p363_079.txt|The course has helped a lot.
p363_080.txt|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
p363_081.txt|There is room for me.
p363_082.txt|That can only be a good thing.
p363_083.txt|I have never seen anything like this.
p363_084.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p363_085.txt|It was that kind of war.
p363_086.txt|That is my preference.
p363_087.txt|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p363_088.txt|It has come a long way since then.
p363_089.txt|It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_090.txt|But someone has got to do it.
p363_091.txt|We have not given up.
p363_092.txt|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_093.txt|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363_094.txt|What has happened?
p363_095.txt|If they are not, the commission will take action.
p363_096.txt|Where will the money come from?
p363_097.txt|She is still very poorly.
p363_098.txt|It was good fun.
p363_099.txt|This is a great shame.
p363_100.txt|We talk about effective military action.
p363_101.txt|I can't get it.
p363_102.txt|It was entirely justified.
p363_103.txt|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p363_104.txt|It's somewhere in between.
p363_105.txt|The play was to go straight ahead.
p363_106.txt|He had never run the distance before.
p363_107.txt|I am the head.
p363_108.txt|He is obviously very dangerous.
p363_109.txt|It can be very worrying.
p363_110.txt|It's harder, believe me.
p363_111.txt|We are making no comment.
p363_112.txt|I sit at home a lot.
p363_113.txt|That was certainly the case for the parties.
p363_114.txt|I hope the couples are still together.
p363_115.txt|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p363_116.txt|But that is not enough.
p363_117.txt|These people are helpless.
p363_118.txt|I wish him well.
p363_119.txt|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p363_120.txt|It would be really interesting if they did.
p363_121.txt|That takes a lot of courage.
p363_122.txt|Sadly, it is not to be.
p363_123.txt|Motorists will welcome this.
p363_124.txt|I welcome this Bill.
p363_125.txt|This is not a problem.
p363_126.txt|he announced his plans.
p363_127.txt|He is the man to beat.
p363_128.txt|We are getting not a penny.
p363_129.txt|Look at the turn-out.
p363_130.txt|Which brings us to the question of money.
p363_131.txt|It is very simple.
p363_132.txt|There was something special about that.
p363_133.txt|Many other areas are coming up.
p363_134.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p363_135.txt|There were no reports of casualties.
p363_136.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p363_137.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363_138.txt|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p363_139.txt|Changes need to be made.
p363_140.txt|Things are going well.
p363_141.txt|Hard it will be.
p363_142.txt|I was deeply worried.
p363_143.txt|Maybe it will work there.
p363_144.txt|How does it all work?
p363_145.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p363_146.txt|There's a lot of it going on.
p363_147.txt|I doubt it would be genuine.
p363_148.txt|It would be a masterclass.
p363_149.txt|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p363_150.txt|I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_151.txt|They will not be going back.
p363_152.txt|The progress has been steady.
p363_153.txt|It has no chance.
p363_154.txt|His body was never found.
p363_155.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p363_156.txt|We have been extremely busy.
p363_157.txt|It appears to have been successful.
p363_158.txt|This is a big game for them.
p363_159.txt|We still have to wait for that.
p363_160.txt|He said it was his greatest work.
p363_161.txt|I feel a little betrayed.
p363_162.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p363_163.txt|I live for today.
p363_164.txt|I have been very stupid.
p363_165.txt|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p363_166.txt|My father and mother are.
p363_167.txt|But that was his nature.
p363_168.txt|We have been together for five years.
p363_169.txt|They would never let him go.
p363_170.txt|So what's in store?
p363_171.txt|He didn't know where to look.
p363_172.txt|The German had a point to make.
p363_173.txt|There are two characters.
p363_174.txt|The only trouble is finding them.
p363_175.txt|Scotland won by six wickets.
p363_176.txt|Her body has never been found.
p363_177.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p363_178.txt|That was a huge experience.
p363_179.txt|Perhaps it was just as well.
p363_180.txt|Will he be here for the weekend?
p363_181.txt|He can do everything.
p363_182.txt|Now is the time for action.
p363_183.txt|Public safety is paramount.
p363_184.txt|I feel really confident in that department.
p363_185.txt|They were not consulted.
p363_186.txt|He had an apartment ready.
p363_187.txt|The prime minister will make the decision.
p363_188.txt|THERE's only one word for it.
p363_189.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p363_190.txt|It was far more important than that.
p363_191.txt|That is European law.
p363_192.txt|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_193.txt|Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_194.txt|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363_195.txt|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363_196.txt|A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_197.txt|I wanted to get on with it.
p363_198.txt|I don't think it's the area.
p363_199.txt|Well, you might have a point.
p363_200.txt|It was a horrible moment.
p363_201.txt|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p363_202.txt|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363_203.txt|I really had to concentrate.
p363_204.txt|We didn't want any trouble.
p363_205.txt|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p363_206.txt|The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363_207.txt|We have still got the fight in us.
p363_208.txt|That decision is now being appealed.
p363_209.txt|This is really good news for us.
p363_210.txt|I wanted to have a go.
p363_211.txt|A senior party insider said.
p363_212.txt|We got on very well.
p363_213.txt|I think it must be the uniforms.
p363_214.txt|This is not a monument to the past.
p363_215.txt|We can all understand that.
p363_216.txt|You are going to have to do it.
p363_217.txt|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_218.txt|Where is the evidence?
p363_219.txt|It was important in training terms.
p363_220.txt|Ours is on for two days.
p363_221.txt|We don't want that at all.
p363_222.txt|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363_223.txt|The group will report back in the summer.
p363_224.txt|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p363_225.txt|We don't come here for our health.
p363_226.txt|That in itself is a joke.
p363_227.txt|They know nothing about the sport.
p363_228.txt|But we shall have to talk to him.
p363_229.txt|Well, we know now.
p363_230.txt|He was only doing his job.
p363_231.txt|They chose the latter.
p363_232.txt|The legal process could last weeks.
p363_233.txt|All were later allowed home.
p363_234.txt|I can do this on my own.
p363_235.txt|Will you just put it away?
p363_236.txt|I think it's more important to have fun.
p363_237.txt|By then it was too late.
p363_238.txt|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_239.txt|I'm so looking forward to it.
p363_240.txt|I think we can do well.
p363_241.txt|That ignorance is crucial.
p363_242.txt|It was an excellent performance.
p363_243.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363_244.txt|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
p363_245.txt|I have not had much of him.
p363_246.txt|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p363_247.txt|We are taking no chances this time.
p363_248.txt|He is to be commended.
p363_249.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p363_250.txt|The goals will come.
p363_251.txt|I don't feel like working.
p363_252.txt|Then one day it happened.
p363_253.txt|I sit in the car.
p363_254.txt|We stopped at half-time.
p363_255.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p363_256.txt|All winners should be tested.
p363_257.txt|We would like to see them in court.
p363_258.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363_259.txt|It is not a soap opera.
p363_260.txt|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
p363_261.txt|They may not always be so lucky.
p363_262.txt|Where was the point in all this?
p363_263.txt|He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_264.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p363_265.txt|This is the root of their problems.
p363_266.txt|Two other men have recovered.
p363_267.txt|It will be a challenging film.
p363_268.txt|The test case is still awaiting action.
p363_269.txt|She is under police escort.
p363_270.txt|However, that is not in itself enough.
p363_271.txt|That should not be their conclusion.
p363_272.txt|We're going to fight it.
p363_273.txt|The plot is minimal.
p363_274.txt|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p363_275.txt|Now we have had enough.
p363_276.txt|Can you believe it?
p363_277.txt|He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_278.txt|I have a problem with these things.
p363_280.txt|The gap is closing.
p363_281.txt|Then there was her childhood.
p363_282.txt|Other people had looked at it.
p363_283.txt|And the other winners are.
p363_284.txt|It was quite a sight.
p363_285.txt|But he was far from alone.
p363_286.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p363_287.txt|I believe he could have turned it around.
p363_288.txt|The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363_289.txt|You are looking at him.
p363_290.txt|The best team won.
p363_291.txt|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
p363_292.txt|It was an achievement all right.
p363_293.txt|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363_294.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363_295.txt|It should be equal.
p363_296.txt|It will make a big difference.
p363_297.txt|I want to make a difference.
p363_298.txt|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_299.txt|He will have it within two weeks.
p363_300.txt|How do you feel?
p363_301.txt|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p363_302.txt|It was not the right time for me.
p363_303.txt|But they have the sound.
p363_304.txt|Not all women are dismayed.
p363_305.txt|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p363_306.txt|It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363_307.txt|It's never happened before.
p363_308.txt|It was a deeper deception.
p363_309.txt|Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_310.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p363_311.txt|There is another side to it.
p363_312.txt|His remit is specific.
p363_313.txt|It will be very damaging for research.
p363_314.txt|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_315.txt|The Old Firm are growing.
p363_316.txt|They want to win the title.
p363_317.txt|Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_318.txt|This decision is a farce.
p363_319.txt|That would be the constructive way forward.
p363_320.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p363_321.txt|It was blown out of proportion.
p363_322.txt|You have no chance of planning permission.
p363_323.txt|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363_324.txt|He was in a mood.
p363_325.txt|Was this element always there?
p363_326.txt|This is an awful lot of money.
p363_327.txt|He was the architect.
p363_328.txt|The United Nations must act.
p363_329.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p363_330.txt|He was a national treasure.
p363_331.txt|I think they are right to be impatient.
p363_332.txt|We need to regroup.
p363_333.txt|I must make that clear.
p363_334.txt|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p363_335.txt|I've never regretted coming here.
p363_336.txt|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p363_337.txt|I just had to go for it.
p363_338.txt|It seems to go down well.
p363_339.txt|I am feeling on top of the world.
p363_341.txt|I don't know, really.
p363_343.txt|Therefore there is a threat.
p363_344.txt|She would love it.
p363_345.txt|One was taken to hospital.
p363_346.txt|You did not see it.
p363_347.txt|Gritty he did not want.
p363_348.txt|The world is being invited to visit.
p363_349.txt|Nobody was able to escape.
p363_350.txt|Surely the answer is yes.
p363_351.txt|Secondly, there is the question of money.
p363_352.txt|He was later deported.
p363_353.txt|I only found out about it this morning.
p363_354.txt|I am not sure.
p363_355.txt|One might think that it is a power.
p363_356.txt|This place is outstanding.
p363_357.txt|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363_358.txt|But it is a fact.
p363_359.txt|They never seem to do anything about it.
p363_360.txt|We're going to sleep.
p363_361.txt|It raises a serious question mark.
p363_362.txt|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p363_363.txt|It was great fun.
p363_364.txt|Experience in this work is paramount.
p363_365.txt|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363_366.txt|It is not needed, it should go.
p363_367.txt|She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_368.txt|We have a business to run.
p363_369.txt|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_370.txt|And there are others.
p363_371.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p363_372.txt|I think we did well.
p363_373.txt|Only two things are certain.
p363_374.txt|There is nothing to fear.
p363_375.txt|Just look at his record.
p363_376.txt|He was a legend.
p363_377.txt|It is a memorial.
p363_378.txt|I have no evidence.
p363_379.txt|But is he?
p363_380.txt|We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_381.txt|The challenge is to win a cup.
p363_382.txt|It is something that we would support.
p363_383.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p363_384.txt|We are in shock.
p363_385.txt|Does it really matter?
p363_386.txt|I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363_387.txt|A decision is expected today.
p363_388.txt|I am enjoying it.
p363_389.txt|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_390.txt|You have to go for it.
p363_391.txt|Are these immoral?
p363_392.txt|It has been a massive success.
p363_393.txt|It is for the same reason.
p363_394.txt|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363_395.txt|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363_396.txt|He will have something to say.
p363_397.txt|You can't take a chance.
p363_398.txt|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363_399.txt|There is a lack of logic.
p363_401.txt|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p363_402.txt|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p363_403.txt|It is a large number.
p363_404.txt|She doesn't know where to begin.
p363_405.txt|This is your chance.
p363_406.txt|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_407.txt|There's nothing she can't do.
p363_408.txt|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p363_409.txt|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363_410.txt|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363_411.txt|He died in September.
p363_412.txt|It was not even this century.
p363_413.txt|That was really tough.
p363_414.txt|It's not going to last five minutes.
p363_415.txt|I am happy with my form.
p363_416.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p363_417.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p363_418.txt|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
p363_419.txt|This is actually true.
p363_420.txt|Both were reduced to rubble.
p363_421.txt|It could have taken another two months.
p363_422.txt|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p363_423.txt|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p364_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p364_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p364_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p364_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p364_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p364_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p364_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p364_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p364_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.

p364_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p364_025.txt|Is that not pathetic?
p364_026.txt|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p364_027.txt|That would be a big step forward.
p364_028.txt|I love you so very much.
p364_029.txt|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p364_030.txt|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364_031.txt|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_032.txt|It is not a matter of concern.
p364_033.txt|We're not either of those things.
p364_034.txt|The man has already had too many chances.
p364_035.txt|It shouldn't be a problem.
p364_036.txt|It was very moving, actually.
p364_037.txt|It isn't a free-for-all.
p364_038.txt|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364_039.txt|I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_040.txt|I thought it was the only way out.
p364_041.txt|We welcome the ministers decision.
p364_042.txt|Since then it has become a tradition.
p364_043.txt|The concept is simple.
p364_044.txt|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p364_045.txt|And that's the trouble with this business.
p364_046.txt|So what did he do?
p364_047.txt|We must not give in to bastards.
p364_048.txt|The trial will open today.
p364_049.txt|But it didn't happen.
p364_050.txt|What do you think they said?
p364_051.txt|There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_053.txt|I can live with that.
p364_054.txt|There is no doubt about that.
p364_055.txt|The president took offence.
p364_056.txt|Our commitment is to move forward.
p364_057.txt|Partly, it is his own fault.
p364_058.txt|That's where it all started.
p364_059.txt|The family is so happy for him.
p364_060.txt|Why has it taken so long?
p364_061.txt|No-one knows the numbers.
p364_062.txt|You make the choice.
p364_063.txt|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
p364_064.txt|I knew the script.
p364_065.txt|It's not going to work.
p364_066.txt|He leaves a beat.
p364_067.txt|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364_068.txt|I see no need to change.
p364_069.txt|It lasted longer than we thought.
p364_070.txt|They've got more time.
p364_071.txt|They made a huge impression on me.
p364_072.txt|There is no hiding place.
p364_073.txt|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364_074.txt|This was a massive result for us.
p364_075.txt|It's not in my nature.
p364_076.txt|You see - this business is a good one.
p364_077.txt|Who is he?
p364_078.txt|Scotland were on Saturday.
p364_079.txt|He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_081.txt|That would be a big mistake.
p364_082.txt|No-one has spoken to me.
p364_083.txt|His arrival could be the making of them.
p364_084.txt|I was close enough.
p364_085.txt|He dismissed the action.
p364_086.txt|I said How much?
p364_087.txt|I support the stand that they are making.
p364_088.txt|The couple had one daughter.
p364_089.txt|But was it really so big?
p364_090.txt|Nature will not find its own level.
p364_091.txt|I didn't have the choice.
p364_092.txt|But this has already been rejected.
p364_094.txt|They have not seen her for years.
p364_095.txt|It was good to score the goal today.
p364_096.txt|Allison is not convinced.
p364_097.txt|He felt there was no case to answer.
p364_098.txt|This is a one-off.
p364_099.txt|He liked to talk.
p364_100.txt|Lots of others were doing the same.
p364_101.txt|It is still holding good today.
p364_102.txt|This takes the pressure off.
p364_103.txt|Our legal advice is clear.
p364_104.txt|But he has a lifeline.
p364_105.txt|This is a horrible loss.
p364_106.txt|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p364_107.txt|We are not leaving the area.
p364_108.txt|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364_109.txt|Success in Scotland is important.
p364_110.txt|We could do a lot worse.
p364_111.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p364_112.txt|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p364_113.txt|It was just great.
p364_114.txt|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p364_115.txt|We don't know what is happening to them.
p364_116.txt|It's an old story.
p364_117.txt|It was an important part of the course.
p364_118.txt|It has been a great success.
p364_119.txt|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_120.txt|Who will take them after that?
p364_121.txt|It is part of their job.
p364_122.txt|This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_123.txt|One is too many.
p364_124.txt|What can you say?
p364_125.txt|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364_126.txt|The money all appears to be gone.
p364_127.txt|He was extremely ill.
p364_128.txt|This time, it was not be.
p364_129.txt|They are unable to say anything.
p364_130.txt|The timing is wrong.
p364_131.txt|That's why he is a national treasure.
p364_132.txt|He just attracted people.
p364_133.txt|He will be fine.
p364_134.txt|I love a clever reader.
p364_135.txt|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364_136.txt|But he's a very quiet man.
p364_137.txt|Destruction came from within.
p364_138.txt|It's not their fault.
p364_140.txt|It won the match.
p364_141.txt|New investment will be openly tendered.
p364_142.txt|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_143.txt|It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364_144.txt|I don't entirely buy that.
p364_145.txt|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364_146.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p364_147.txt|I would say so.
p364_148.txt|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p364_149.txt|It's a good story.
p364_150.txt|Do not listen to them.
p364_151.txt|It was too soon.
p364_152.txt|It is an absolute disgrace.
p364_153.txt|I don't think it is the case.
p364_154.txt|Everyone would have been happy.
p364_155.txt|It has paid off.
p364_156.txt|Ferguson had done his homework.
p364_157.txt|He deserved that much.
p364_158.txt|We want to know about the policy.
p364_159.txt|Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364_160.txt|He has gone back to school.
p364_161.txt|It is not illegal.
p364_162.txt|I don't know where it went.
p364_163.txt|There was nothing anyone could do.
p364_164.txt|I don't want to use the term.
p364_165.txt|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364_166.txt|Now they have to do something about it.
p364_167.txt|The post will be unpaid.
p364_168.txt|One-third of the places are already taken.
p364_169.txt|I hope that doesn't happen.
p364_170.txt|It's all happening at a local level.
p364_171.txt|You will never replace the child.
p364_172.txt|We must do that.
p364_173.txt|England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_174.txt|This has been fantastic.
p364_175.txt|I'm delighted for the lads.
p364_176.txt|I learned that only yesterday.
p364_177.txt|It's very very frustrating.
p364_178.txt|We want him to continue that way.
p364_179.txt|But he did not rule out further talks.
p364_180.txt|Our children are our future.
p364_181.txt|It's part of your life.
p364_182.txt|We will see how he is.
p364_183.txt|He had a horror.
p364_184.txt|So it was in politics.
p364_185.txt|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p364_187.txt|The matter has been reported to the police.
p364_188.txt|We are at war.
p364_189.txt|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364_190.txt|The state is controlled by the left.
p364_191.txt|The principle is quite clear.
p364_192.txt|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
p364_193.txt|I would say the risk is very small.
p364_194.txt|And there are different perspectives.
p364_195.txt|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364_196.txt|I put the drawing down.
p364_197.txt|The hearing continues today.
p364_198.txt|You would be wrong.
p364_199.txt|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p364_200.txt|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364_201.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p364_202.txt|The attitude was good today.
p364_203.txt|I've got nothing to say.
p364_204.txt|It requires a wider team.
p364_205.txt|It is so beautiful.
p364_206.txt|It is suitable and sensible.
p364_207.txt|In many ways it was disastrous.
p364_208.txt|I am really, really happy.
p364_209.txt|This is perfectly legal.
p364_210.txt|I'm not interested in money.
p364_211.txt|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364_212.txt|I can handle the pace.
p364_213.txt|I am happy to be here.
p364_214.txt|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364_215.txt|I believe it would have been successful.
p364_216.txt|It's better to be happy.
p364_217.txt|It's happened, but it's a dream.
p364_218.txt|I had a son.
p364_219.txt|It was very, very frightening.
p364_220.txt|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p364_221.txt|I had no choice.
p364_222.txt|What do you do.
p364_223.txt|It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364_224.txt|This one would have been.
p364_225.txt|We just have to improve.
p364_226.txt|It hasn't worked out that way.
p364_227.txt|This is very good news.
p364_228.txt|Is it a warning to parents?
p364_229.txt|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364_230.txt|There is nothing wrong with that.
p364_231.txt|I could not believe the results.
p364_232.txt|What do you do?
p364_233.txt|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
p364_234.txt|It was all over for us then.
p364_235.txt|They were assured that it would.
p364_236.txt|Thankfully they liked it.
p364_237.txt|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p364_238.txt|We just do not do it.
p364_239.txt|It was a long time coming.
p364_240.txt|It had happened to him.
p364_241.txt|That is our business.
p364_242.txt|We were completely outplayed.
p364_243.txt|The car driver was not injured.
p364_244.txt|It was a surprising decision.
p364_245.txt|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p364_246.txt|I believe in having difficult times.
p364_247.txt|Stand by for action.
p364_248.txt|It was something special.
p364_249.txt|He deserves a top team.
p364_250.txt|We just need the Government to act.
p364_251.txt|It was really surprising.
p364_252.txt|It was a nightmare.
p364_253.txt|But this is just the first step.
p364_254.txt|We can do it.
p364_255.txt|This is as bad as it gets.
p364_256.txt|The real issue is personal.
p364_257.txt|That can happen so easily.
p364_258.txt|We deserved to get the victory today.
p364_259.txt|That's the last thing he will do.
p364_260.txt|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p364_261.txt|It does not take much.
p364_262.txt|It would be a bonus for this game.
p364_263.txt|I've seen it work already.
p364_264.txt|Do you mean today?
p364_265.txt|Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_266.txt|This could be the case.
p364_267.txt|We try to keep it right.
p364_268.txt|I have got to keep the lid on.
p364_269.txt|Or so we thought.
p364_270.txt|For many, it had become a fact of life.
p364_271.txt|Last season was very hard for me.
p364_272.txt|It was a definite penalty.
p364_273.txt|It's great fun to get to act.
p364_274.txt|We are keen to have him back.
p364_275.txt|Horses have some sense.
p364_276.txt|It goes in cycles.
p364_277.txt|And now he has decided, enough.
p364_278.txt|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_279.txt|He made no comment.
p364_280.txt|We have to get on with it.
p364_281.txt|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
p364_282.txt|It would be dangerous to resign.
p364_283.txt|It is a victory to that extent.
p364_284.txt|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p364_285.txt|I certainly hope so.
p364_286.txt|She died later on Monday.
p364_287.txt|It does and it doesn't.
p364_288.txt|It will not be today, though.
p364_289.txt|We suspect he was pleased.
p364_290.txt|I have been here for only three months.
p364_291.txt|We have no knowledge of this.
p364_292.txt|I was the willing journeyman.
p364_293.txt|I know we ask a lot of you.
p364_294.txt|When he got up he was hit again.
p364_297.txt|It was just one man.
p364_298.txt|It's going to be tough.
p364_299.txt|You will be very, very welcome.
p364_300.txt|I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364_301.txt|Is he any good?
p364_302.txt|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p364_303.txt|It was then that Rangers scored.
p364_304.txt|This was repeated the second time.
p364_305.txt|I chose the former.
p364_306.txt|Sub Not Used, McKee.
p364_308.txt|They were very responsive.
p364_309.txt|We're talking to him.
p374_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p374_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p374_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p374_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p374_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p374_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p374_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p374_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p374_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p374_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.

p374_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p374_025.txt|She had to learn a new discipline.
p374_026.txt|This isn't some form of commission.
p374_027.txt|The game today is certainly different.
p374_028.txt|We did it in one take.
p374_029.txt|I'll take the blame for that.
p374_030.txt|And that was just for starters.
p374_031.txt|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p374_032.txt|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_033.txt|I will always remember the horrible images.
p374_034.txt|What you sow, you have to reap.
p374_035.txt|We are expecting a big crowd.
p374_036.txt|I was contacted this morning.
p374_037.txt|He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_038.txt|It's not just a challenge for us.
p374_039.txt|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p374_040.txt|I've had a ball.
p374_041.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_042.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p374_043.txt|I still hope to go.
p374_044.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p374_045.txt|As a player you have to move on.
p374_046.txt|It is so out of character.
p374_047.txt|I am inclined to play it down.
p374_048.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p374_049.txt|His condition was serious but stable.
p374_050.txt|He had reason to be pleased.
p374_051.txt|We have a problem.
p374_052.txt|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_053.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p374_054.txt|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_055.txt|I suspect the latter.
p374_056.txt|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p374_057.txt|It is simple, really.
p374_058.txt|The net is closing.
p374_059.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_060.txt|That took a long time to happen.
p374_061.txt|It was on fire.
p374_062.txt|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_063.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p374_064.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p374_065.txt|Where is the discipline?
p374_066.txt|We were very much a happy family.
p374_067.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p374_068.txt|This time it is official.
p374_069.txt|It's going to be epic.
p374_070.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p374_071.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p374_072.txt|I didn't mean to kill her.
p374_073.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p374_074.txt|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374_075.txt|I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374_076.txt|What method of funding is being used?
p374_077.txt|It is not a standing army.
p374_078.txt|This is a great day.
p374_079.txt|He got his degree.
p374_080.txt|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_081.txt|and their remit is limited.
p374_082.txt|I have great respect for all my players.
p374_083.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p374_084.txt|There is no question of dithering.
p374_085.txt|His track record is not promising.
p374_086.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p374_087.txt|It would be very dangerous.
p374_088.txt|Now it has been eclipsed.
p374_089.txt|Our numbers are small.
p374_090.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374_091.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p374_092.txt|It's not right of Labour.
p374_093.txt|It doesn't always work that way.
p374_094.txt|This was much worse.
p374_095.txt|That, though, is not true.
p374_096.txt|I'm working at the moment.
p374_097.txt|However, this is only the start.
p374_098.txt|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p374_099.txt|He loved it, and so did they.
p374_100.txt|I want to be there by right.
p374_101.txt|That was very important.
p374_102.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p374_103.txt|I hope they understand that.
p374_104.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p374_105.txt|It's a very, very special day.
p374_106.txt|Let that be their memorial.
p374_107.txt|We're all paying for it.
p374_108.txt|Lester was like that.
p374_109.txt|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p374_110.txt|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p374_111.txt|We were never told it was already decided.
p374_112.txt|It was a sickening sight.
p374_113.txt|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p374_114.txt|I don't think it would make any difference.
p374_115.txt|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_116.txt|If that is not a warning, what is it?
p374_117.txt|I fell in love with it.
p374_118.txt|It ignores the future.
p374_119.txt|The quality of work is very impressive.
p374_120.txt|That's not going to happen again.
p374_121.txt|Paterson was the man.
p374_122.txt|The course is in great condition.
p374_123.txt|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p374_124.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p374_125.txt|It's up to them.
p374_126.txt|They went to the press.
p374_127.txt|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p374_128.txt|We are very pleased.
p374_129.txt|You're not going to get hurt.
p374_130.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374_131.txt|I was very fortunate.
p374_132.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p374_133.txt|Players want to know what is on offer.
p374_134.txt|They are a good team.
p374_135.txt|The contest was already over.
p374_136.txt|Does it make a profit?
p374_137.txt|Now, that would impress the kids.
p374_138.txt|It was the only possible decision.
p374_139.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p374_140.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p374_141.txt|Where is the logic in that?
p374_142.txt|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p374_143.txt|I told the players that at half-time.
p374_144.txt|I see the extended family once a year.
p374_145.txt|Why is this?
p374_146.txt|It was indeed a night to remember.
p374_147.txt|Raymond was always on the outside.
p374_148.txt|There is something in this.
p374_149.txt|And so it should.
p374_150.txt|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374_151.txt|They may differ on other issues.
p374_152.txt|That's the important thing.
p374_153.txt|But opinion was divided.
p374_154.txt|Next league matches Motherwell.
p374_155.txt|I have been there already.
p374_156.txt|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p374_157.txt|Scott and Emily were so happy.
p374_158.txt|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p374_159.txt|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p374_160.txt|And sooner than we may think.
p374_161.txt|It is a step up.
p374_162.txt|You probably have never seen them before.
p374_163.txt|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p374_164.txt|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374_165.txt|Something has got to change.
p374_166.txt|I made a mistake.
p374_167.txt|I'd never given up on myself.
p374_168.txt|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374_169.txt|That's the kind of production it was.
p374_170.txt|Little girls are his victims.
p374_171.txt|It is not for me, though.
p374_172.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p374_173.txt|The rest is his own.
p374_174.txt|The statement was a lie.
p374_175.txt|It is the manager's decision.
p374_176.txt|It was a day for records.
p374_177.txt|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p374_178.txt|There's no reason for panic.
p374_179.txt|We have got away with it.
p374_180.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p374_181.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p374_182.txt|He had planned to sell it.
p374_183.txt|It was just one of those days.
p374_184.txt|But it did not last.
p374_185.txt|She has been unable to work since.
p374_186.txt|No-one has ever seen inside.
p374_187.txt|I know nothing about that.
p374_188.txt|We have not given up.
p374_189.txt|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_190.txt|It's a matter of time.
p374_191.txt|The number never came.
p374_192.txt|You encourage them - you can do it.
p374_193.txt|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p374_194.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p374_195.txt|The stadium was full.
p374_196.txt|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p374_197.txt|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p374_198.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p374_199.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p374_200.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374_201.txt|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374_202.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374_203.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p374_204.txt|It was so unfair.
p374_205.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p374_206.txt|They have to be dealt with.
p374_207.txt|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p374_208.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p374_209.txt|They were that poor.
p374_210.txt|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p374_211.txt|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p374_212.txt|We're very close to being a good team.
p374_213.txt|All these things have an impact.
p374_214.txt|I thought their commitment was superb.
p374_215.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p374_216.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p374_217.txt|I had nothing to lose.
p374_218.txt|That is just not true.
p374_219.txt|History is made at the Masters.
p374_220.txt|This is not a European Army.
p374_221.txt|Not so, he insisted.
p374_222.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p374_223.txt|I wonder what they listen to?
p374_224.txt|Does a lot of drawing.
p374_225.txt|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374_226.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p374_227.txt|He is doing just that.
p374_228.txt|The night is young.
p374_229.txt|That is bad enough.
p374_230.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p374_231.txt|I suspect that it will.
p374_232.txt|We need to think.
p374_233.txt|We are very happy with the verdict.
p374_234.txt|They want it to work.
p374_235.txt|For once it wasn't about money.
p374_236.txt|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p374_237.txt|That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374_238.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p374_239.txt|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374_240.txt|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p374_241.txt|It's always somebody else's.
p374_242.txt|It could now be up to the courts.
p374_243.txt|We can make a difference.
p374_244.txt|This was not a contest.
p374_245.txt|It is just so sad.
p374_246.txt|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p374_247.txt|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p374_248.txt|It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374_249.txt|I get very excited by that.
p374_250.txt|The members have clearly spoken.
p374_251.txt|It was not pretty.
p374_252.txt|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374_253.txt|Which means it matters.
p374_254.txt|This is certainly not the case.
p374_255.txt|There is great potential on this river.
p374_256.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374_257.txt|Our thoughts are with his family.
p374_258.txt|It is a technique.
p374_259.txt|The court has not decided.
p374_260.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p374_261.txt|I just want to get rid of it.
p374_262.txt|I have not come in to take over.
p374_263.txt|Is this accurate?
p374_264.txt|But what did it matter?
p374_265.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p374_266.txt|I am expecting to win.
p374_267.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p374_268.txt|I was an athlete.
p374_269.txt|We don't need to change the law.
p374_270.txt|All of us do.
p374_271.txt|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p374_272.txt|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
p374_273.txt|We can only do that for so long.
p374_274.txt|He got very close tonight.
p374_275.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p374_276.txt|It is our other home.
p374_277.txt|Where do you start?
p374_278.txt|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p374_279.txt|It was the first time they met.
p374_280.txt|I am also delighted for all the players.
p374_281.txt|We are delighted with that.
p374_282.txt|He did very well, but didn't win.
p374_283.txt|And we're not there yet.
p374_284.txt|People don't feel safe, including me.
p374_285.txt|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374_286.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p374_287.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p374_288.txt|I had a good life at Rangers.
p374_289.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p374_290.txt|He's very good at relating to adults.
p374_291.txt|It opened last month.
p374_292.txt|Just a year later he was dead.
p374_293.txt|You must be ready to play anyone.
p374_294.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p374_295.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p374_296.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p374_297.txt|I don't know them or anything.
p374_298.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p374_299.txt|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p374_300.txt|Because we do not need it.
p374_301.txt|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p374_302.txt|They use them for everything.
p374_303.txt|I've already got this.
p374_304.txt|There's a story, too.
p374_305.txt|There have been different reports from different people.
p374_306.txt|But it has all been worthwhile.
p374_307.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p374_308.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p374_309.txt|This is as bad as it can get.
p374_310.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p374_311.txt|It was just awful.
p374_312.txt|There was a hell of a row.
p374_313.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p374_314.txt|I am not a threat to coaches.
p374_315.txt|It's never over until it's over.
p374_316.txt|He had been a singer.
p374_317.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p374_318.txt|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p374_319.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374_320.txt|No one was listening.
p374_321.txt|It's not one for the purists.
p374_322.txt|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374_323.txt|It really is good to be back.
p374_324.txt|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p374_325.txt|It will never happen.
p374_326.txt|We cannot go on like this.
p374_327.txt|The biggest thing is structure.
p374_328.txt|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p374_329.txt|This is great news for us.
p374_330.txt|We certainly have to try something.
p374_331.txt|SO now we know the secret.
p374_332.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p374_333.txt|What is that?
p374_334.txt|We just want them home.
p374_335.txt|And we have beaten them before.
p374_336.txt|He has two children.
p374_337.txt|That is the fact of the matter.
p374_338.txt|It was a matter of choice.
p374_339.txt|And that's good news for the magpies.
p374_340.txt|But we can't have a casino.
p374_341.txt|I'm looking forward to that.
p374_342.txt|So what is their secret?
p374_343.txt|It's a great idea.
p374_344.txt|It was not being marketed properly.
p374_345.txt|I have been struggling with my form.
p374_346.txt|That was about it.
p374_347.txt|It is coming on very well.
p374_348.txt|We won't go down without a struggle.
p374_349.txt|By hard work, is the answer.
p374_350.txt|We were unlucky not to score.
p374_351.txt|I did not have a bet on myself.
p374_352.txt|As if they ever stopped.
p374_353.txt|And that brings us to the point.
p374_354.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p374_355.txt|But happily, the story is true.
p374_356.txt|It does seem a mystery.
p374_357.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p374_358.txt|It's for that reason he should resign.
p374_359.txt|It's a good start.
p374_360.txt|One person had a broken back.
p374_361.txt|I hope that is the lucky break.
p374_362.txt|It is almost like a family.
p374_363.txt|But when we do it is great.
p374_364.txt|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p374_365.txt|My game is coming back.
p374_366.txt|It was a game they could have won.
p374_367.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p374_368.txt|It is a matter for Westminster.
p374_369.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p374_370.txt|I can't believe the buzz.
p374_371.txt|Sport is good for you.
p374_372.txt|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p374_373.txt|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p374_374.txt|This is the goal.
p374_375.txt|The mood was euphoric.
p374_376.txt|I want to get at the truth.
p374_377.txt|Everyone here is very sad.
p374_378.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p374_379.txt|I am not changing my mind.
p374_380.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p374_381.txt|He was taken ill in his office.
p374_382.txt|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p374_383.txt|It's the only thing.
p374_384.txt|Two others were also seriously injured.
p374_385.txt|What's the best thing to do?
p374_386.txt|For tragedy it is.
p374_387.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p374_388.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p374_389.txt|It was good today.
p374_390.txt|We are all very pleased.
p374_391.txt|The hotel was huge.
p374_392.txt|These days are over.
p374_393.txt|They do it properly.
p374_394.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p374_395.txt|I just don't know what she was doing.
p374_396.txt|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p374_397.txt|You can't have both.
p374_398.txt|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374_399.txt|I was influenced by all of these things.
p374_400.txt|You do not change overnight.
p374_401.txt|Or so it seemed.
p374_402.txt|I will have to think about it.
p374_403.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374_404.txt|Well, you can't have everything.
p374_405.txt|They have not given them the evidence.
p374_406.txt|We need to chat.
p374_407.txt|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374_408.txt|That was never their agenda.
p374_409.txt|I certainly will not settle.
p374_410.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p374_411.txt|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p374_412.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p374_413.txt|I don't make it mystical.
p374_414.txt|So what was he really doing?
p374_415.txt|Neither could be contacted last night.
p374_416.txt|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_417.txt|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374_418.txt|And well he might.
p374_419.txt|They have not been named.
p374_420.txt|It feels like too much.
p374_421.txt|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p374_422.txt|Next year this time  we will be home.
p374_423.txt|That time has passed.
p374_424.txt|It will be crucial.
