p226_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p226_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p226_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p226_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p226_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p226_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p226_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p226_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p226_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p226_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p226_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p226_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p226_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p226_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p226_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p226_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p226_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p226_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p226_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p226_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p226_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p226_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p226_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p226_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p226_025.txt|He has not been named.
p226_026.txt|That's no bad thing.
p226_027.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226_028.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226_029.txt|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226_030.txt|Because we do not need it.
p226_031.txt|This is the window.
p226_032.txt|I was an athlete.
p226_033.txt|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226_034.txt|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226_036.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226_037.txt|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p226_039.txt|It has failed.
p226_040.txt|It was clear.
p226_041.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p226_042.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p226_043.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p226_044.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p226_045.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p226_046.txt|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226_047.txt|We need to chat.
p226_048.txt|It's a blessing.
p226_049.txt|But it might have done.
p226_050.txt|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p226_051.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p226_052.txt|It is the whole package.
p226_053.txt|He had no enemies.
p226_054.txt|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p226_055.txt|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226_056.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p226_057.txt|It's the big omission.
p226_058.txt|Next league matches Celtic.
p226_059.txt|She's a spy!
p226_060.txt|It is unique.
p226_061.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226_062.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226_063.txt|It's a real challenge.
p226_064.txt|It is not great art.
p226_065.txt|You do not change overnight.
p226_066.txt|Art is extra.
p226_067.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p226_068.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p226_069.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226_070.txt|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226_071.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p226_072.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p226_073.txt|The script was funny.
p226_074.txt|You need a trademark.
p226_075.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p226_076.txt|Help is needed.
p226_077.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p226_078.txt|There could be a way back.
p226_079.txt|Neither it is.
p226_080.txt|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p226_082.txt|It is a terrible place.
p226_083.txt|It works for us.
p226_084.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p226_085.txt|It can be halted.
p226_086.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p226_088.txt|Detection is often difficult.
p226_089.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226_090.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p226_091.txt|Someone who cares
p226_092.txt|It's just awful.
p226_093.txt|It's never too late.
p226_094.txt|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p226_095.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p226_096.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p226_097.txt|We could not get any possession.
p226_098.txt|If you could find it.
p226_099.txt|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p226_100.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226_101.txt|It was mayhem.
p226_102.txt|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226_103.txt|They were outside the circle.
p226_104.txt|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p226_105.txt|May not have been at fault?
p226_106.txt|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226_107.txt|It was a good performance.
p226_108.txt|That time is not now, however.
p226_109.txt|Oil embargo endorsed.
p226_110.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p226_111.txt|It was an adventure.
p226_112.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p226_113.txt|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226_114.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p226_115.txt|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p226_116.txt|It is normal.
p226_117.txt|I don't have many friends.
p226_118.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226_119.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p226_120.txt|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226_121.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p226_122.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226_124.txt|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p226_125.txt|She's got to say something.
p226_126.txt|It is a delight on every level.
p226_127.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226_128.txt|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p226_129.txt|She has been shot.
p226_130.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p226_131.txt|I was furious.
p226_132.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226_133.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p226_134.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226_135.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226_136.txt|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p226_137.txt|It will be too hot.
p226_138.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226_139.txt|I am now unemployed.
p226_140.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p226_141.txt|Our intentions are real.
p226_142.txt|Government will intervene.
p226_143.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226_144.txt|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226_145.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226_146.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226_148.txt|Three penalties were given.
p226_149.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p226_150.txt|We just had a go.
p226_151.txt|We have seen a copy of the report.
p226_152.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226_153.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p226_154.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226_155.txt|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226_156.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p226_157.txt|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p226_158.txt|We will turn the corner.
p226_159.txt|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p226_160.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p226_161.txt|These days are long gone.
p226_162.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p226_163.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p226_164.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226_165.txt|We have to move forward.
p226_166.txt|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226_167.txt|They will do their own thing.
p226_168.txt|It is too much for me.
p226_169.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p226_171.txt|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p226_172.txt|It became a book by itself.
p226_173.txt|His team management was protective.
p226_174.txt|It's quite a routine.
p226_175.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p226_176.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p226_177.txt|I took the gun.
p226_178.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p226_179.txt|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p226_180.txt|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p226_181.txt|I've been there.
p226_183.txt|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226_184.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p226_185.txt|It is not fair.
p226_186.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p226_187.txt|I had a train to catch.
p226_188.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p226_189.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p226_190.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p226_191.txt|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p226_192.txt|People will ask about us.
p226_193.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p226_194.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p226_195.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p226_197.txt|There was no option.
p226_198.txt|Is that it?
p226_199.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p226_200.txt|Is that success?
p226_201.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p226_202.txt|They are in the euro.
p226_203.txt|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p226_204.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p226_205.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p226_206.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p226_207.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p226_208.txt|I don't want to use it.
p226_209.txt|Now, it's all right.
p226_210.txt|It's like a garage.
p226_211.txt|But I am a worried man.
p226_212.txt|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p226_213.txt|Feel the heat?
p226_214.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p226_215.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p226_216.txt|His third goal was superb.
p226_217.txt|It's not ideal.
p226_218.txt|I was so nervous.
p226_219.txt|I might come back.
p226_220.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p226_221.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p226_223.txt|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p226_224.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p226_225.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p226_226.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p226_227.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p226_228.txt|I am immensely sad.
p226_229.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p226_230.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p226_231.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p226_232.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p226_233.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p226_234.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p226_235.txt|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p226_236.txt|It is set in Paris.
p226_237.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p226_238.txt|Hospitals are for the ill.
p226_239.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p226_240.txt|She is well balanced.
p226_241.txt|They are all bright and different.
p226_242.txt|It's only fair.
p226_243.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p226_244.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226_245.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p226_246.txt|His body was never found.
p226_247.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p226_248.txt|I was shocked.
p226_249.txt|I should think so, too.
p226_251.txt|There's the mix.
p226_252.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p226_253.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p226_254.txt|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p226_255.txt|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p226_256.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p226_257.txt|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p226_258.txt|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p226_259.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p226_260.txt|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p226_261.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p226_262.txt|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p226_263.txt|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p226_264.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p226_265.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p226_266.txt|The warning is timely.
p226_267.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p226_268.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p226_269.txt|They are never here.
p226_270.txt|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p226_271.txt|He was popular.
p226_272.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p226_273.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p226_274.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226_276.txt|It's a way of life.
p226_278.txt|I feel pretty good.
p226_279.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p226_280.txt|He has a wealth of experience.
p226_281.txt|It happens from time to time.
p226_283.txt|He looked very sharp.
p226_284.txt|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p226_285.txt|It was a virus.
p226_286.txt|Yet, it worked.
p226_287.txt|Who will perform?
p226_288.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p226_289.txt|This is a national crisis.
p226_290.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p226_291.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p226_292.txt|It goes back a long way.
p226_293.txt|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p226_294.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p226_295.txt|He should have won.
p226_296.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p226_297.txt|There's a pause.
p226_298.txt|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p226_299.txt|There was no hint of scandal.
p226_300.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p226_301.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p226_302.txt|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p226_303.txt|One was a lawyer.
p226_304.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p226_305.txt|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p226_306.txt|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p226_307.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p226_308.txt|This is a war over our home.
p226_309.txt|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226_310.txt|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p226_311.txt|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p226_312.txt|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p226_313.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p226_314.txt|I did not name it.
p226_315.txt|It was a question of patience.
p226_316.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p226_317.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p226_318.txt|Kids are terrible.
p226_319.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p226_320.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p226_321.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p226_322.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p226_323.txt|He said she was mad.
p226_324.txt|We are in the end game.
p226_325.txt|I am very happy to be here.
p226_326.txt|The airport was even different.
p226_327.txt|We do the same.
p226_328.txt|That's the law of the land.
p226_329.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p226_330.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p226_331.txt|Donald was his friend.
p226_332.txt|I am so upset.
p226_333.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p226_334.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p226_335.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p226_336.txt|It is a time bomb.
p226_337.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p226_338.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p226_339.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p226_340.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226_341.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226_342.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p226_343.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226_344.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p226_345.txt|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p226_346.txt|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p226_347.txt|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226_348.txt|Look at the witnesses.
p226_349.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p226_350.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p226_351.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226_352.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p226_353.txt|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p226_354.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p226_355.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p226_356.txt|She is free.
p226_357.txt|I kept going for her.
p226_358.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p226_359.txt|He's very explosive.
p226_360.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p226_361.txt|Our numbers are small.
p226_362.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p226_363.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p226_364.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p226_365.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p226_366.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p226_367.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p226_368.txt|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p226_369.txt|He took over our lives.
p226_370.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p227_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p227_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p227_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p227_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p227_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p227_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p227_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p227_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p227_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p227_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p227_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p227_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p227_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p227_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p227_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p227_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p227_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p227_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p227_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p227_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p227_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p227_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p227_025.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p227_026.txt|Movement has to take place.
p227_027.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p227_028.txt|We will look into it.
p227_029.txt|This is a central issue.
p227_030.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p227_031.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p227_032.txt|There, you were just a body.
p227_033.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p227_034.txt|President Bush is at war.
p227_035.txt|I became a widow overnight.
p227_036.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p227_037.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p227_038.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p227_039.txt|Among them are many criminals.
p227_040.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227_041.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p227_042.txt|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p227_043.txt|I'd come back from London.
p227_044.txt|If I was a woman.
p227_045.txt|He was a home referee.
p227_046.txt|There was no safety net.
p227_047.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p227_048.txt|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227_049.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p227_050.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p227_051.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p227_052.txt|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p227_053.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p227_054.txt|I could not do it.
p227_055.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p227_056.txt|How are you, sir ?
p227_057.txt|So is that it, then ?
p227_058.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p227_059.txt|What do we do ?
p227_060.txt|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227_061.txt|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p227_062.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p227_063.txt|We will pay their bills.
p227_064.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p227_065.txt|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p227_066.txt|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227_067.txt|I have proved that in the past.
p227_068.txt|He had been a singer.
p227_069.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227_070.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p227_071.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p227_072.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227_073.txt|It is a terrible place.
p227_074.txt|Even the one she loved.
p227_075.txt|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227_076.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p227_077.txt|I first met him last summer.
p227_078.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p227_079.txt|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227_080.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p227_081.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p227_082.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p227_083.txt|They lived for their children.
p227_084.txt|Potions said he would drive.
p227_085.txt|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p227_086.txt|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227_087.txt|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p227_088.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p227_089.txt|You might not make it.
p227_090.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p227_091.txt|That is the important thing.
p227_092.txt|For once, you should believe the hype.
p227_093.txt|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p227_094.txt|Their attitude is all wrong.
p227_095.txt|You are like an animal.
p227_096.txt|No, the equipment is extra.
p227_097.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p227_098.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227_099.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p227_100.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p227_101.txt|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227_102.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p227_103.txt|It was never a starter.
p227_104.txt|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227_105.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p227_106.txt|It is safe in our hands.
p227_107.txt|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p227_108.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p227_109.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p227_110.txt|That admission is not surprising.
p227_111.txt|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227_112.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p227_113.txt|However, we have to be cautious.
p227_114.txt|But we could only help a handful of people.
p227_116.txt|It is just a tax on employment.
p227_117.txt|This should begin in October.
p227_118.txt|My life has changed a lot.
p227_119.txt|We did what we had to do.
p227_120.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p227_121.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p227_122.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p227_123.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p227_124.txt|And does it ?
p227_125.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p227_126.txt|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227_127.txt|Any success would have been an improvement.
p227_128.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227_129.txt|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p227_130.txt|He is a great addition to our team.
p227_131.txt|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227_132.txt|I felt he was excellent.
p227_133.txt|They could use a boost.
p227_134.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p227_135.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p227_136.txt|This is a limited market.
p227_137.txt|Our position is quite simple.
p227_138.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p227_139.txt|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227_140.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227_141.txt|He's not a Celtic man.
p227_142.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p227_143.txt|So I got a blood test.
p227_144.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p227_145.txt|These men are a part of India.
p227_146.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p227_147.txt|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p227_148.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p227_149.txt|That was the difference between the sides.
p227_150.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p227_151.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p227_152.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p227_153.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p227_154.txt|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227_155.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p227_156.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p227_157.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p227_158.txt|It is difficult to say.
p227_159.txt|He was in great spirits.
p227_160.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p227_161.txt|They want to see him.
p227_162.txt|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p227_163.txt|Nobody did in those days.
p227_164.txt|There is no signature on this document.
p227_165.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p227_166.txt|What happened in that game ?
p227_167.txt|Are you going to win ?
p227_168.txt|Was it the wife ?
p227_169.txt|Why change it ?
p227_170.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p227_171.txt|The people are the hero.
p227_172.txt|One season, they might do well.
p227_173.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p227_174.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227_175.txt|The jury is still out.
p227_176.txt|But he has a lifeline.
p227_177.txt|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227_178.txt|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p227_179.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p227_180.txt|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227_181.txt|I think it's a good sign.
p227_183.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p227_184.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p227_186.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p227_187.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p227_188.txt|We've just had it confirmed.
p227_189.txt|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227_190.txt|This is the time to use it.
p227_191.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p227_192.txt|They were seriously after him.
p227_193.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227_194.txt|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227_195.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p227_196.txt|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p227_197.txt|The force is with them.
p227_198.txt|If the director is with you.
p227_199.txt|He made no order on costs.
p227_200.txt|I guess I was lucky, though.
p227_201.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227_203.txt|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227_204.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p227_205.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p227_206.txt|My heart is with the artist.
p227_207.txt|That might mean another delay.
p227_208.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p227_209.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227_210.txt|This is a holy place.
p227_211.txt|Does the name matter ?
p227_212.txt|how do you get it back ?
p227_213.txt|What are you not good at ?
p227_214.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p227_215.txt|Who was she ?
p227_216.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p227_217.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227_218.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_219.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p227_220.txt|There is no quick fix.
p227_222.txt|They have known the hard times.
p227_223.txt|That might help a bit.
p227_226.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p227_227.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p227_228.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p227_229.txt|It's just a normal life.
p227_230.txt|He must get to know himself.
p227_231.txt|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p227_232.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p227_233.txt|The fight is under way.
p227_235.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p227_236.txt|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p227_237.txt|We can certainly build on this.
p227_238.txt|William Hague delighted his party.
p227_239.txt|There is a world of difference.
p227_240.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p227_241.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p227_242.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p227_243.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p227_244.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p227_245.txt|It is the voice of the survivors.
p227_246.txt|She died in middle age.
p227_247.txt|It is set in Paris.
p227_248.txt|You will have seen the adverts.
p227_249.txt|It is possible to be too good.
p227_250.txt|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227_251.txt|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227_252.txt|The irony was not lost.
p227_253.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p227_254.txt|It is a court case.
p227_255.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p227_256.txt|She took them for a term.
p227_257.txt|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227_258.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p227_259.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p227_260.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227_261.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p227_262.txt|Our decision making was poor.
p227_263.txt|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p227_264.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p227_265.txt|And they were being paid ?
p227_266.txt|Was everything done to save people ?
p227_267.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p227_268.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p227_269.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p227_270.txt|Did he trip ?
p227_271.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227_272.txt|I should think so, too.
p227_273.txt|No production contract is yet in sight.
p227_274.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p227_275.txt|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p227_276.txt|I told you I was ill.
p227_277.txt|I can't get a job.
p227_278.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p227_279.txt|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227_280.txt|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p227_281.txt|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227_282.txt|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p227_283.txt|Every one is a winner.
p227_284.txt|There's not much money in cycling.
p227_285.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227_286.txt|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227_287.txt|They can leave at any time.
p227_288.txt|You get a lot for your money.
p227_289.txt|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p227_290.txt|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227_291.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p227_292.txt|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227_293.txt|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227_294.txt|But the plot is not the point.
p227_295.txt|It was never a free kick.
p227_296.txt|My body is a wreck.
p227_297.txt|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p227_298.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p227_299.txt|She failed in her action.
p227_300.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p227_301.txt|It's hard to see it.
p227_302.txt|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227_303.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p227_304.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p227_305.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227_306.txt|It is an amazing response.
p227_307.txt|Size is not the issue.
p227_308.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p227_309.txt|We have the easy part.
p227_310.txt|We are not increasing the number.
p227_311.txt|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227_312.txt|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227_313.txt|It could well be military.
p227_314.txt|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227_315.txt|His job was not advertised.
p227_316.txt|This is a big step up.
p227_317.txt|It goes back a long way.
p227_318.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p227_319.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p227_320.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p227_321.txt|I have got a victim.
p227_322.txt|The judge was really nice.
p227_323.txt|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p227_324.txt|McNaughton was not so sure.
p227_326.txt|The dealer is on notice.
p227_327.txt|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227_328.txt|The party lasted all night.
p227_329.txt|He would help me with the form.
p227_330.txt|There's still a bit to go.
p227_331.txt|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227_332.txt|I would do away with the dress code.
p227_333.txt|It is so easy to be negative.
p227_334.txt|What form did that take ?
p227_335.txt|Are they free ?
p227_336.txt|What are they for ?
p227_337.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p227_338.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339.txt|So what happens next ?
p227_340.txt|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227_341.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p227_342.txt|Have a look at this lot.
p227_343.txt|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227_344.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227_345.txt|The king is delighted by the honour.
p227_347.txt|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227_348.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p227_349.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p227_350.txt|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227_351.txt|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227_352.txt|There was no time scale.
p227_353.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p227_354.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p227_355.txt|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p227_356.txt|They were the acts of men.
p227_357.txt|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227_358.txt|Of course, we want to go home.
p227_359.txt|I am very interested in the subject.
p227_360.txt|He is not very big, either.
p227_361.txt|A report is expected next month.
p227_363.txt|We are encouraged by the news.
p227_364.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p227_365.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p227_366.txt|Is it worth it ?
p227_367.txt|Does it matter ?
p227_368.txt|A crucial moment has arrived.
p227_369.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p227_370.txt|We need to be prepared.
p227_371.txt|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227_372.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p227_373.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227_374.txt|It has been made to entertain.
p227_375.txt|It is a stroke of genius.
p227_376.txt|Italy was just behind the US.
p227_377.txt|It was forced to divert.
p227_378.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p227_379.txt|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227_380.txt|We are still getting over it.
p227_382.txt|This will impact on us.
p227_383.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p227_384.txt|He is in the queue.
p227_385.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p227_386.txt|I do not like to lose.
p227_387.txt|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227_388.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p227_389.txt|In due course the deal was done.
p227_390.txt|Celtic were pleased to help.
p227_391.txt|They will fight for everything.
p227_392.txt|That's not like us at all.
p227_393.txt|You have to rely on each other.
p227_394.txt|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227_395.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p227_396.txt|It is a terrible equation.
p227_397.txt|They have not got anyone.
p227_398.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p227_399.txt|How do you take them away ?
p227_400.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p227_401.txt|After the match, do you ?
p227_402.txt|Persuaded to change his mind.
p232_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p232_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p232_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p232_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p232_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p232_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p232_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p232_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p232_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p232_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p232_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p232_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p232_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p232_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p232_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p232_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p232_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p232_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p232_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p232_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p232_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p232_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p232_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p232_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p232_026.txt|But it failed.
p232_027.txt|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232_028.txt|They should be so lucky.
p232_029.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p232_030.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232_031.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p232_032.txt|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232_033.txt|I would love it.
p232_034.txt|It is marvellous.
p232_035.txt|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_036.txt|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232_037.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p232_038.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p232_039.txt|I was scared.
p232_040.txt|Dancing was her life.
p232_041.txt|I suspect the latter.
p232_042.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232_043.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p232_044.txt|We will push.
p232_045.txt|It is urgent.
p232_046.txt|The judge said.
p232_047.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p232_048.txt|But it might have done.
p232_049.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p232_050.txt|They had to explain it.
p232_051.txt|Here's a clue.
p232_052.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p232_053.txt|It's the big omission.
p232_054.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232_055.txt|It's very odd.
p232_056.txt|Because we do not need it.
p232_057.txt|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p232_058.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232_059.txt|That's the truth.
p232_060.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p232_061.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232_062.txt|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232_063.txt|You do not change overnight.
p232_064.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p232_065.txt|He was popular.
p232_066.txt|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p232_067.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p232_068.txt|It is like a river running by my home.
p232_069.txt|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p232_070.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p232_071.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232_072.txt|That was the easy election.
p232_073.txt|There could be a way back.
p232_074.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p232_075.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p232_076.txt|I had my suspicions.
p232_077.txt|It was chaotic.
p232_078.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p232_079.txt|He is now resident in England.
p232_080.txt|I've got the shirt.
p232_081.txt|Today she has been released.
p232_082.txt|What has changed ?
p232_083.txt|That is bound to happen.
p232_084.txt|I will miss him.
p232_085.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p232_086.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p232_087.txt|No progress has been made.
p232_088.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p232_089.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p232_090.txt|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p232_091.txt|It is a lifeline.
p232_092.txt|Today I couldn't run on it.
p232_093.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p232_094.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232_095.txt|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p232_096.txt|Then came the crunch.
p232_097.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232_098.txt|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p232_099.txt|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232_100.txt|It was mayhem.
p232_101.txt|They were outside the circle.
p232_102.txt|It was a good performance.
p232_103.txt|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p232_104.txt|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p232_105.txt|That is no use.
p232_106.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p232_107.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p232_108.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p232_109.txt|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p232_110.txt|I don't have many friends.
p232_111.txt|He was jailed for a year.
p232_112.txt|You had better believe it.
p232_113.txt|It's not fair.
p232_114.txt|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232_115.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p232_116.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p232_117.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232_118.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232_119.txt|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232_120.txt|It is rubbish.
p232_121.txt|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p232_122.txt|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232_123.txt|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232_124.txt|That's all right then.
p232_125.txt|I'm so angry.
p232_126.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232_127.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p232_128.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p232_129.txt|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232_130.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p232_131.txt|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232_132.txt|I am now unemployed.
p232_133.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p232_134.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p232_135.txt|Our intentions are real.
p232_136.txt|They took a risk.
p232_137.txt|The goals were good.
p232_138.txt|What will happen then ?
p232_139.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p232_140.txt|He is severe.
p232_141.txt|She died at her home.
p232_142.txt|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p232_143.txt|They did very well.
p232_144.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p232_145.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p232_146.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p232_147.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p232_148.txt|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p232_149.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232_150.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p232_151.txt|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232_152.txt|It was by the numbers.
p232_153.txt|I was in daily contact.
p232_154.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p232_155.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p232_156.txt|It is an attitude of mind.
p232_158.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232_159.txt|We have to move forward.
p232_160.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232_161.txt|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232_162.txt|Tell it like it was ?
p232_163.txt|It is not too late to get on board.
p232_164.txt|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p232_165.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p232_166.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p232_167.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p232_168.txt|That will do for me.
p232_169.txt|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232_170.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p232_171.txt|My life has been destroyed.
p232_172.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p232_173.txt|It became a book by itself.
p232_174.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p232_175.txt|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232_176.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p232_177.txt|Blair's response was weak.
p232_178.txt|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232_179.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p232_180.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p232_181.txt|The clarity is vital.
p232_182.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p232_183.txt|Everyone can be bought.
p232_184.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p232_185.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232_186.txt|It is the whole package.
p232_187.txt|I've been there.
p232_188.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232_189.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p232_190.txt|We did everything by the book.
p232_191.txt|I wish I could say something.
p232_192.txt|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p232_193.txt|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p232_194.txt|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232_195.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p232_196.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p232_197.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232_198.txt|The conference is the first test.
p232_199.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p232_200.txt|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232_201.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p232_202.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232_203.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p232_204.txt|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232_205.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p232_206.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p232_207.txt|I don't want to use it.
p232_208.txt|Now, it's all right.
p232_209.txt|There was an e-mail.
p232_210.txt|That's the day job.
p232_211.txt|Feel the heat ?
p232_212.txt|He knows a lot.
p232_213.txt|He is slightly confused.
p232_214.txt|She should not be blamed.
p232_215.txt|His third goal was superb.
p232_216.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p232_217.txt|It's not ideal.
p232_218.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p232_219.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232_220.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232_221.txt|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232_223.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p232_224.txt|That has been the easy part.
p232_225.txt|We've got the bronze.
p232_226.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p232_227.txt|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232_228.txt|It was good fun.
p232_229.txt|What was the main difference ?
p232_230.txt|I am immensely sad.
p232_231.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p232_232.txt|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232_233.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p232_234.txt|But she was.
p232_235.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p232_236.txt|We were awful.
p232_237.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p232_238.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p232_239.txt|It is set in Paris.
p232_240.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232_241.txt|It's quite nice.
p232_242.txt|It's quite a line-up!
p232_243.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p232_244.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p232_245.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p232_246.txt|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232_247.txt|She is well balanced.
p232_248.txt|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232_249.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p232_250.txt|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232_251.txt|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p232_252.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232_253.txt|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232_254.txt|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232_255.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p232_256.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p232_257.txt|I can't get a job.
p232_258.txt|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232_259.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232_260.txt|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232_261.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232_262.txt|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232_263.txt|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232_264.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232_265.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p232_266.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p232_267.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232_268.txt|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p232_269.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232_270.txt|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p232_271.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p232_272.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p232_273.txt|He was also married with two children.
p232_274.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p232_275.txt|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232_276.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p232_277.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232_278.txt|They wanted the club to make money.
p232_279.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p232_280.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p232_281.txt|It's a way of life.
p232_282.txt|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p232_283.txt|I am an estate agent.
p232_284.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p232_285.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p232_286.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p232_287.txt|It happens from time to time.
p232_288.txt|He looked very sharp.
p232_289.txt|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232_290.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p232_291.txt|They were also beside themselves.
p232_292.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p232_293.txt|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232_294.txt|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232_295.txt|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p232_296.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p232_297.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p232_298.txt|He should have won.
p232_299.txt|He has retired.
p232_300.txt|What has altered ?
p232_301.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p232_302.txt|Nothing is safe.
p232_303.txt|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232_305.txt|They are wrong.
p232_306.txt|It is a road of death.
p232_307.txt|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232_308.txt|We are in the end game.
p232_309.txt|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232_310.txt|He was solid.
p232_311.txt|Special measures were needed.
p232_312.txt|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p232_313.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p232_314.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p232_315.txt|Kids are terrible.
p232_316.txt|It should be equal.
p232_317.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p232_318.txt|The home team had an amazing start.
p232_319.txt|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p232_320.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p232_321.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p232_322.txt|However, the groups denied the claims.
p232_323.txt|I came into this world with nothing.
p232_324.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232_325.txt|Off with their heads.
p232_326.txt|It's not long enough.
p232_327.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p232_328.txt|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p232_329.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p232_330.txt|It could have gone either way.
p232_331.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p232_332.txt|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p232_333.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p232_334.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232_335.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p232_336.txt|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232_337.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232_338.txt|The team for the first game could be this one.
p232_339.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p232_340.txt|Who will do it ?
p232_341.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232_342.txt|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232_343.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p232_344.txt|He has to learn.
p232_345.txt|Indeed, it was magical.
p232_346.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p232_347.txt|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232_348.txt|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232_349.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232_350.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p232_351.txt|Everything was an effort.
p232_352.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p232_353.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p232_354.txt|It is long gone.
p232_355.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232_356.txt|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232_357.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p232_358.txt|It's not that clear-cut.
p232_359.txt|She is free.
p232_360.txt|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232_361.txt|I kept going for her.
p232_362.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p232_363.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232_364.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232_365.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p232_366.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p232_367.txt|He has seen the past.
p232_368.txt|It was one in the afternoon.
p232_369.txt|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232_370.txt|We will be homeless.
p232_371.txt|The scene is about this ?
p232_372.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p232_373.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232_374.txt|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232_375.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p232_376.txt|He could make it.
p232_377.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p232_378.txt|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p232_379.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p232_380.txt|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232_381.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p232_382.txt|Five members were disciplined.
p232_383.txt|Talks are progressing.
p232_384.txt|There is no signature.
p232_385.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p232_386.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232_387.txt|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232_388.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p232_389.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p232_390.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p232_391.txt|You thought it was a headache.
p232_392.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p232_393.txt|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232_394.txt|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p232_395.txt|We're looking for justice.
p232_396.txt|I can lead by example.
p232_397.txt|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232_398.txt|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232_399.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232_400.txt|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232_401.txt|It is legally binding.
p232_402.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p232_403.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p232_404.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p232_405.txt|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p232_406.txt|He was a crazy man.
p232_407.txt|We should have known.
p232_408.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p232_409.txt|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232_410.txt|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232_411.txt|You wanted the evidence.
p232_412.txt|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232_413.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p232_414.txt|I was very young.
p232_415.txt|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p233_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p233_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p233_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p233_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p233_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p233_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p233_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p233_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p233_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p233_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p233_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p233_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p233_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p233_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p233_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p233_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p233_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p233_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p233_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p233_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p233_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p233_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p233_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p233_025.txt|We are a service industry.
p233_026.txt|But we will have to wait.
p233_027.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p233_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p233_029.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p233_030.txt|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p233_032.txt|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p233_033.txt|This is a central issue.
p233_037.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233_038.txt|Victory was never in doubt.
p233_039.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p233_040.txt|We are the party of the future.
p233_041.txt|I have never been a member of the council.
p233_042.txt|He was in his element.
p233_043.txt|That means an extra two years.
p233_044.txt|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233_045.txt|All businesses continue to trade.
p233_046.txt|The man became a reporter.
p233_047.txt|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233_048.txt|It is all starting to come together.
p233_049.txt|Part of the complex is historic.
p233_050.txt|The strategy is not without risk.
p233_051.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p233_052.txt|I was released after six days.
p233_053.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p233_054.txt|We are working on it.
p233_055.txt|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233_056.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p233_057.txt|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p233_058.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p233_059.txt|There was no safety net.
p233_060.txt|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233_061.txt|You have to be patient.
p233_062.txt|That is all in the past.
p233_063.txt|That could be a mistake.
p233_064.txt|It was an amazing result.
p233_065.txt|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p233_066.txt|He has not been dropped.
p233_067.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p233_068.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p233_070.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p233_071.txt|She did that for the rest of her life.
p233_072.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p233_073.txt|It starts with the script.
p233_074.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p233_075.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p233_076.txt|We can all make a mistake.
p233_077.txt|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p233_079.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233_080.txt|On the night, it was not enough.
p233_081.txt|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p233_082.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p233_083.txt|They were badly prepared for it.
p233_084.txt|It is not a story.
p233_085.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p233_086.txt|How are you, sir ?
p233_087.txt|So is that it, then ?
p233_088.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p233_089.txt|What do we do ?
p233_090.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p233_091.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233_092.txt|They have a further report to make in March.
p233_093.txt|He is in the US.
p233_094.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233_095.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p233_096.txt|I had a bit in hand.
p233_097.txt|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p233_098.txt|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p233_099.txt|That is the fact of the matter.
p233_100.txt|It should be a condition of employment.
p233_101.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233_102.txt|It is much as it has been described.
p233_103.txt|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233_104.txt|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p233_105.txt|He has become a monster.
p233_106.txt|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p233_107.txt|Everyone had to play the game.
p233_108.txt|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233_109.txt|It is not affected by the sale.
p233_110.txt|We are currently working on the details.
p233_111.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p233_112.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p233_113.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p233_114.txt|It was the eighties.
p233_115.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p233_116.txt|You had better believe it.
p233_117.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233_118.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p233_119.txt|My office is bare.
p233_120.txt|I'm delighted about that.
p233_121.txt|I joined a group.
p233_122.txt|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233_123.txt|Who would be a referee?
p233_125.txt|That's all right then.
p233_126.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p233_127.txt|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233_128.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233_129.txt|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p233_130.txt|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233_131.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233_132.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p233_133.txt|It's an amazing landscape!
p233_134.txt|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233_135.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233_136.txt|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p233_137.txt|I am now unemployed.
p233_138.txt|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p233_139.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p233_140.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233_141.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233_142.txt|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233_143.txt|Is that it ?
p233_144.txt|I saw some terrible things.
p233_146.txt|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p233_147.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p233_148.txt|Who would be right ?
p233_149.txt|She died at her home.
p233_150.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233_151.txt|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233_152.txt|It is like a football team.
p233_153.txt|It would be a last resort.
p233_154.txt|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233_155.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p233_156.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p233_157.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p233_158.txt|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p233_159.txt|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233_160.txt|I was so nervous.
p233_161.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p233_162.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p233_163.txt|It is not normal practice.
p233_164.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233_165.txt|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p233_166.txt|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p233_167.txt|Neither side can win this war.
p233_168.txt|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233_169.txt|It is so unfair.
p233_170.txt|I will tell you.
p233_171.txt|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233_172.txt|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233_173.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p233_174.txt|It's that sort of night.
p233_175.txt|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p233_176.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p233_177.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p233_178.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p233_179.txt|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233_180.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p233_181.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p233_182.txt|He will feel the pain again.
p233_183.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p233_184.txt|Is Saddam a threat ?
p233_185.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p233_186.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p233_187.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p233_188.txt|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p233_189.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233_190.txt|I was totally wrong.
p233_191.txt|There is no point in looking any further.
p233_192.txt|I've been there.
p233_193.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p233_194.txt|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p233_195.txt|It's a joke.
p233_196.txt|I had a train to catch.
p233_197.txt|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233_198.txt|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233_199.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p233_200.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233_201.txt|He may need it.
p233_203.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p233_204.txt|It wasn't to be.
p233_208.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p233_209.txt|I have a cold.
p233_210.txt|He had suffered a heart attack.
p233_211.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p233_212.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p233_213.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p233_214.txt|That will be vital.
p233_215.txt|We need to handle it.
p233_216.txt|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233_217.txt|I had relied on him.
p233_218.txt|His third goal was superb.
p233_220.txt|In each case they were a goal down.
p233_221.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p233_222.txt|Work has started.
p233_223.txt|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233_224.txt|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233_225.txt|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p233_226.txt|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p233_228.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p233_229.txt|You have to do your research.
p233_230.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p233_231.txt|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233_232.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p233_233.txt|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233_234.txt|My neighbours are horrified.
p233_235.txt|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p233_236.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p233_237.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p233_238.txt|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233_239.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p233_240.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233_241.txt|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233_242.txt|We were extremely poor.
p233_243.txt|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p233_244.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p233_245.txt|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233_246.txt|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233_247.txt|The salary changes are long overdue.
p233_248.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p233_249.txt|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233_250.txt|There wasn't a goal.
p233_251.txt|It was a cry for help.
p233_252.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p233_253.txt|This year I understood.
p233_254.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p233_255.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233_256.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233_257.txt|I watched a game.
p233_258.txt|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p233_259.txt|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233_260.txt|I was happily surprised.
p233_261.txt|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233_262.txt|It is also very valuable.
p233_263.txt|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233_264.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233_265.txt|It is not just about pay.
p233_266.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p233_267.txt|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233_268.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p233_269.txt|They are never here.
p233_270.txt|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233_271.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p233_272.txt|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233_273.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p233_274.txt|He is a young man with a new deal.
p233_275.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p233_276.txt|It is the same in Sweden.
p233_277.txt|And Michael was just great.
p233_278.txt|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233_279.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p233_280.txt|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233_281.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233_282.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233_283.txt|I feel pretty good.
p233_284.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p233_285.txt|It was a privilege to work for him.
p233_286.txt|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p233_288.txt|They were too hard.
p233_289.txt|He looked very sharp.
p233_290.txt|All options are open.
p233_291.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p233_292.txt|It was a virus.
p233_294.txt|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233_295.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p233_296.txt|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233_297.txt|Who can predict ?
p233_298.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p233_299.txt|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p233_300.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p233_301.txt|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233_302.txt|I thought it was my only chance.
p233_303.txt|One was a lawyer.
p233_304.txt|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p233_305.txt|They should be swept away.
p233_306.txt|This is a war over our home.
p233_307.txt|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233_308.txt|I was in daily contact.
p233_309.txt|We want to play at the worlds.
p233_310.txt|This is the culture change in medicine.
p233_311.txt|Is there on his hands ?
p233_312.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p233_313.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p233_314.txt|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233_315.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p233_316.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p233_317.txt|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p233_319.txt|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p233_320.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p233_321.txt|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233_322.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p233_323.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p233_324.txt|I saw some good things.
p233_325.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233_326.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p233_327.txt|It added to the spectacle.
p233_328.txt|Who was the mystery MP ?
p233_329.txt|He told the court.
p233_330.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p233_331.txt|Who will do it ?
p233_332.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p233_333.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233_334.txt|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p233_335.txt|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233_336.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233_337.txt|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233_338.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p233_339.txt|I've learned from my mistakes.
p233_340.txt|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233_341.txt|The composer will conduct.
p233_342.txt|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p233_343.txt|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233_344.txt|His contract was then not renewed.
p233_345.txt|Eight months later, he was dead.
p233_346.txt|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233_347.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p233_348.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233_349.txt|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p233_350.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p233_351.txt|He agreed with my proposal.
p233_352.txt|Hartley should know.
p233_353.txt|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233_354.txt|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233_355.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233_356.txt|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p233_357.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p233_358.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233_359.txt|He could make it.
p233_360.txt|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233_361.txt|They have not done so this season so far.
p233_362.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233_363.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p233_364.txt|They received a reply from their own managers.
p233_365.txt|But I managed.
p233_366.txt|They play together perfectly.
p233_367.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233_368.txt|Colour was at the core of his life.
p233_369.txt|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233_370.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p233_371.txt|We shall not be moved.
p233_373.txt|It was a hit.
p233_374.txt|He's a nice guy.
p233_375.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233_376.txt|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p233_377.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233_378.txt|The mood was defiant.
p233_379.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p233_381.txt|It's just outrageous.
p233_382.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p233_383.txt|It is unusual.
p233_384.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p233_385.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233_386.txt|That set the tone.
p233_387.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p233_388.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p233_389.txt|What happened in the summer ?
p233_390.txt|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233_391.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233_392.txt|He has not created a Festival resource.
p236_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p236_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p236_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p236_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p236_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p236_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p236_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p236_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p236_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p236_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p236_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p236_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p236_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p236_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p236_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p236_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p236_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p236_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p236_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p236_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p236_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p236_025.txt|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236_026.txt|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p236_027.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p236_028.txt|Because we do not need it.
p236_029.txt|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236_030.txt|And we have a singer.
p236_031.txt|He was jailed for four years.
p236_032.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p236_033.txt|This is a central issue.
p236_034.txt|He works at the airport.
p236_035.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p236_036.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p236_037.txt|It carried a double message.
p236_038.txt|That means an extra two years.
p236_039.txt|That was the case with David.
p236_040.txt|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236_041.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p236_042.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p236_043.txt|Their campaign is in disarray.
p236_044.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p236_045.txt|We are working on it.
p236_046.txt|He looks like an Afghan.
p236_047.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p236_048.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236_049.txt|This is the interesting part.
p236_050.txt|I haven't been ill at all.
p236_051.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236_052.txt|That was the difference today.
p236_053.txt|We keep an eye on it.
p236_054.txt|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236_055.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p236_056.txt|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p236_057.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p236_058.txt|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236_059.txt|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p236_060.txt|I have proved that in the past.
p236_061.txt|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p236_062.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p236_063.txt|I was as strong as a horse.
p236_064.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p236_065.txt|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p236_066.txt|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p236_068.txt|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236_069.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p236_070.txt|He was seen as the enemy.
p236_071.txt|It looks like a hit.
p236_072.txt|These people are not big names.
p236_073.txt|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p236_074.txt|We did it for the jersey.
p236_075.txt|The Festival is prepared to help.
p236_076.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p236_077.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p236_078.txt|He was just a journalist.
p236_079.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p236_080.txt|They lived for their children.
p236_081.txt|We have turned the corner.
p236_083.txt|The Queen Mother is dead.
p236_084.txt|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236_085.txt|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236_086.txt|It was a big departure.
p236_087.txt|Does it matter ?
p236_088.txt|How do you take them away ?
p236_089.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p236_090.txt|After the match, do you ?
p236_091.txt|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236_092.txt|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p236_093.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p236_094.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236_095.txt|I had a ball today.
p236_096.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p236_097.txt|That time is not now, however.
p236_098.txt|We created so many chances.
p236_099.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p236_100.txt|Our house was very small.
p236_101.txt|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236_102.txt|It became difficult for me.
p236_103.txt|It's not a lack of effort.
p236_104.txt|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p236_105.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p236_107.txt|They will notice a difference.
p236_108.txt|Football is a passion for many.
p236_109.txt|New Year will be very busy.
p236_110.txt|There's still plenty time left.
p236_111.txt|The result is a vacuum.
p236_112.txt|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236_113.txt|You can spend money on housing.
p236_114.txt|The hearing was due to continue today.
p236_115.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p236_116.txt|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p236_117.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236_118.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p236_119.txt|Which can happen any time.
p236_120.txt|The colours are very pretty.
p236_121.txt|He is a lovely man.
p236_122.txt|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p236_123.txt|I was on a roll.
p236_124.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236_125.txt|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236_126.txt|He said to give a local injection.
p236_127.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p236_128.txt|You are a gambling man.
p236_129.txt|Before it was an ordeal.
p236_130.txt|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p236_131.txt|We will try to find someone.
p236_132.txt|They could use a boost.
p236_133.txt|She died at her home.
p236_134.txt|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p236_135.txt|I enjoy the creative process.
p236_136.txt|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236_137.txt|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p236_138.txt|It was a piece of art.
p236_139.txt|That view has not altered.
p236_140.txt|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p236_141.txt|So I got a blood test.
p236_142.txt|It has become a way of life.
p236_143.txt|The whole industry is a shambles.
p236_144.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p236_145.txt|We will provide immediate access.
p236_146.txt|He could do nothing about it.
p236_147.txt|We have a clean bill of health.
p236_148.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p236_149.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p236_151.txt|It was by the numbers.
p236_152.txt|It would seem a natural progression.
p236_153.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236_154.txt|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236_155.txt|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236_156.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p236_157.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p236_158.txt|We did what we had to do.
p236_159.txt|It's not like us.
p236_161.txt|It is not a financial issue.
p236_162.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p236_163.txt|Seven people were later detained by police.
p236_164.txt|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236_165.txt|We have a budget in March.
p236_166.txt|He is not a team captain.
p236_167.txt|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236_168.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p236_169.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p236_170.txt|That is not the case.
p236_172.txt|It's nice to be nice.
p236_173.txt|They could not match it.
p236_174.txt|Are they free ?
p236_175.txt|What are they for ?
p236_176.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p236_177.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178.txt|So what happens next ?
p236_179.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p236_180.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p236_181.txt|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p236_182.txt|One season, they might do well.
p236_183.txt|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p236_184.txt|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236_185.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p236_186.txt|City sentiment is in his favour.
p236_187.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p236_188.txt|We are the gateway to justice.
p236_189.txt|Tomorrow is a new day.
p236_190.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p236_191.txt|Each case is treated on merit.
p236_192.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p236_193.txt|Says the Duke of York.
p236_194.txt|I had too much to drink.
p236_195.txt|As many as the market will support.
p236_196.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p236_197.txt|That is a waste of energy.
p236_198.txt|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236_199.txt|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236_200.txt|I had a train to catch.
p236_201.txt|It shows the strength of the roots.
p236_202.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p236_203.txt|This youngster is so exciting!
p236_204.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p236_205.txt|It caused a lot of upset.
p236_206.txt|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236_207.txt|My duty is to win.
p236_208.txt|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p236_209.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236_210.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p236_211.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p236_212.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p236_213.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p236_214.txt|The early physical reports were clear.
p236_215.txt|Tommy is not a problem.
p236_216.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236_217.txt|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p236_218.txt|A deadline is still essential.
p236_219.txt|You have caught a serial killer.
p236_220.txt|You are a great player.
p236_221.txt|I won't make an official complaint.
p236_222.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p236_223.txt|They are looking at a flotation.
p236_224.txt|Which isn't a bad idea.
p236_225.txt|There is no quick fix.
p236_226.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p236_227.txt|That might help a bit.
p236_228.txt|From there, they can go anywhere.
p236_229.txt|Death is outside the language.
p236_230.txt|I had relied on him.
p236_231.txt|The course has helped a lot.
p236_232.txt|I'm just a regular person.
p236_233.txt|It had all been arranged.
p236_234.txt|His third goal was superb.
p236_235.txt|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p236_236.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p236_237.txt|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p236_238.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p236_239.txt|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236_240.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p236_241.txt|They said that they stood by their statement.
p236_242.txt|You have to do your research.
p236_243.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p236_244.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p236_245.txt|Truth is the child of time.
p236_246.txt|And they were being paid ?
p236_247.txt|Was everything done to save people ?
p236_249.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p236_250.txt|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p236_251.txt|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236_252.txt|It's important to get it right.
p236_253.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p236_254.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p236_255.txt|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p236_256.txt|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236_257.txt|I was just a kid.
p236_258.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p236_259.txt|It was quite a new prescription.
p236_260.txt|It is very hard for her.
p236_261.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236_262.txt|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236_263.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p236_264.txt|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236_265.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p236_266.txt|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p236_267.txt|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p236_268.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236_269.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p236_270.txt|But they were never expected to last.
p236_271.txt|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236_272.txt|The capital costs are modest.
p236_273.txt|I told you I was ill.
p236_274.txt|He will go on the bench.
p236_275.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p236_276.txt|We accept the new rules.
p236_277.txt|We run within the law.
p236_278.txt|We have the moral high ground.
p236_279.txt|He took over our lives.
p236_280.txt|It has all been done in secret.
p236_281.txt|They must play for each other.
p236_282.txt|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p236_283.txt|She always wanted her own way.
p236_284.txt|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p236_285.txt|They can leave at any time.
p236_286.txt|Much of the equipment was new.
p236_287.txt|Blair also had a penalty.
p236_288.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p236_289.txt|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p236_290.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p236_291.txt|My body is a wreck.
p236_292.txt|She failed in her action.
p236_293.txt|Stephen will get his first cap.
p236_294.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p236_295.txt|And that match was played in June.
p236_296.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p236_297.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p236_298.txt|Does the name matter ?
p236_299.txt|how do you get it back ?
p236_300.txt|What are you not good at ?
p236_301.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p236_302.txt|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p236_303.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236_304.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p236_305.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236_306.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p236_307.txt|The rescue package is public money.
p236_308.txt|I was there five months ago.
p236_309.txt|I am a retailer by nature.
p236_310.txt|His job was not advertised.
p236_311.txt|We can work all night.
p236_312.txt|It was really very frightening.
p236_313.txt|It was an excellent performance.
p236_314.txt|The answer is with ourselves.
p236_315.txt|And we can do it.
p236_316.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p236_317.txt|That is the real test.
p236_318.txt|They have to be addressed.
p236_319.txt|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236_320.txt|Cast Away now on general release.
p236_321.txt|All winners should be tested.
p236_322.txt|I can live with it.
p236_323.txt|A lot has been written.
p236_324.txt|And he goes with it.
p236_325.txt|The law will take its course.
p236_326.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p236_327.txt|This ruling is a farce.
p236_328.txt|After some discussion they did.
p236_329.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p236_330.txt|I didn't have the reply.
p236_331.txt|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236_332.txt|These days will be back.
p236_333.txt|You may have a short memory.
p236_335.txt|There was no time scale.
p236_336.txt|That decision has already been made.
p236_337.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p236_338.txt|The game is now open.
p236_339.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236_340.txt|Even the one she loved.
p236_341.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p236_342.txt|It was almost too much.
p236_343.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p236_344.txt|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236_345.txt|Three years ago he would have been.
p236_346.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p236_347.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p236_348.txt|The confidence isn't there now.
p236_349.txt|We put our bid in last night.
p236_350.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p236_351.txt|He had no previous convictions.
p236_352.txt|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p236_353.txt|What do we do ?
p236_354.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p236_355.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p236_356.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p236_357.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236_358.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p236_359.txt|Scotland is the home of golf.
p236_360.txt|They have broken that promise.
p236_361.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p236_362.txt|It's only a matter of scale.
p236_363.txt|We must put a marker down.
p236_364.txt|She said they would appeal.
p236_365.txt|There is no deal as yet.
p236_366.txt|It's as wide as a church in here.
p236_367.txt|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p236_368.txt|It was like a weekly wage.
p236_369.txt|We are a Scottish company.
p236_370.txt|They will fight for everything.
p236_371.txt|The pair are very much in love.
p236_372.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p236_373.txt|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p236_374.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236_375.txt|Everyone could see the joke.
p236_376.txt|All would be under threat.
p236_377.txt|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236_378.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p236_379.txt|The seller was not revealed.
p236_380.txt|People are on the alert.
p236_381.txt|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236_382.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p236_383.txt|A review is under way.
p236_384.txt|They know it'll be fantastic.
p236_385.txt|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236_386.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p236_387.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p236_388.txt|It brought in new management.
p236_389.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p236_390.txt|She is in their hands.
p236_391.txt|The following day I used the story.
p236_392.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236_393.txt|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p236_394.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p236_395.txt|I should think so, too.
p236_396.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p236_397.txt|How are you, sir ?
p236_398.txt|So is that it, then ?
p236_399.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p236_400.txt|It certainly appeared that way.
p236_401.txt|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p236_402.txt|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236_403.txt|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236_404.txt|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p236_405.txt|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p236_406.txt|It had been on the cards.
p236_407.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p236_408.txt|The trick is to try it.
p236_409.txt|I would love to think that she could win.
p236_410.txt|He may have a point.
p236_411.txt|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236_412.txt|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236_413.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p236_414.txt|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p236_415.txt|I've got my own ideas.
p236_416.txt|I never had a childhood.
p236_417.txt|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236_418.txt|I think it's a miracle.
p236_419.txt|They were not complacent in any way.
p236_420.txt|They did the right thing.
p236_421.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p236_422.txt|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236_423.txt|It is an absolute nonsense.
p236_424.txt|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236_425.txt|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236_426.txt|Everything in golf is a balance.
p236_427.txt|It is a case of pity for us.
p236_428.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p236_429.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p236_430.txt|We've got a good management record.
p236_431.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p236_432.txt|Paris is not only young.
p236_433.txt|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236_434.txt|But you can go beyond that condition.
p236_435.txt|But we have built a platform for next season.
p236_436.txt|It looked like a war zone.
p236_437.txt|He said current trading was strong.
p236_438.txt|I chose to make a film.
p236_439.txt|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236_440.txt|But by that time, it was too late.
p236_441.txt|The damage is all inside.
p236_442.txt|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p236_443.txt|We would have concerns about that.
p236_444.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p236_445.txt|Taxes may need to rise.
p236_446.txt|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236_447.txt|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p236_448.txt|No options are excluded at all.
p236_449.txt|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p236_450.txt|We are going for it.
p236_451.txt|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236_452.txt|It is a cause for concern.
p236_453.txt|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236_454.txt|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p236_455.txt|He deserved a red card.
p236_456.txt|They were not even allowed to see them.
p236_457.txt|And she is very clear on this.
p236_458.txt|And it covers the spectrum.
p236_459.txt|Dennis was not so sure.
p236_460.txt|The chief constable has retired.
p236_461.txt|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236_462.txt|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236_463.txt|Not if you know the person.
p236_464.txt|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236_465.txt|I was all image and no substance.
p236_466.txt|The boys are mentally focused.
p236_467.txt|It can all be done over the phone.
p236_468.txt|The bill would be massive.
p236_469.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p236_470.txt|Neither woman has been named.
p236_471.txt|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236_472.txt|We live by the rule of law.
p236_473.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p236_474.txt|He was a shooting star.
p236_475.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p236_476.txt|I am a committed European.
p236_477.txt|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236_478.txt|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236_479.txt|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236_480.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p236_481.txt|He will be advised by me.
p236_482.txt|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236_483.txt|We had to add value.
p236_484.txt|That is the bottom line.
p236_485.txt|It happens on an annual basis.
p236_486.txt|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236_487.txt|We have to go for a win.
p236_488.txt|It worked well in Monaco.
p236_489.txt|Something has got to change.
p236_490.txt|I had it before the final.
p236_491.txt|Our fans have been marvellous.
p236_492.txt|The BBC was a disgrace.
p236_493.txt|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p236_494.txt|It was still there, but right at the end.
p236_495.txt|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236_496.txt|They never gave up hope.
p236_497.txt|He had planned to sell it.
p236_498.txt|I was ready for this.
p236_499.txt|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p236_500.txt|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236_501.txt|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236_502.txt|I stayed away from the defence.
p236_503.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p243_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p243_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p243_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p243_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p243_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p243_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p243_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p243_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p243_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p243_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p243_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p243_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p243_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p243_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p243_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p243_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p243_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p243_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p243_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p243_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p243_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p243_025.txt|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243_026.txt|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p243_027.txt|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p243_028.txt|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p243_029.txt|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p243_030.txt|She brought a lot to my life.
p243_031.txt|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243_032.txt|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243_033.txt|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243_034.txt|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p243_035.txt|It is about control of our economy.
p243_036.txt|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p243_037.txt|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p243_038.txt|He added that her comments were noted.
p243_039.txt|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243_040.txt|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243_041.txt|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243_042.txt|He does not even trust his own members.
p243_043.txt|He too started on the subs seats.
p243_044.txt|Is it worth it ?
p243_045.txt|Does it matter ?
p243_046.txt|How do you take them away ?
p243_047.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p243_048.txt|After the match, do you ?
p243_049.txt|Has the conflict started ?
p243_050.txt|Have I really come to this ?
p243_051.txt|I'm as fit as I can get.
p243_052.txt|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p243_053.txt|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243_054.txt|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243_055.txt|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243_056.txt|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p243_057.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243_058.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243_059.txt|We just want this season to end.
p243_060.txt|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243_061.txt|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p243_062.txt|The referee is there to decide these things.
p243_063.txt|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243_064.txt|It also has a good labour supply.
p243_065.txt|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p243_066.txt|Do not give your details to anyone.
p243_067.txt|He was failed by his health authority.
p243_068.txt|But it was not all bad news.
p243_069.txt|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243_070.txt|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p243_071.txt|It turned me against the whole system.
p243_072.txt|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243_073.txt|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243_074.txt|But two groups refused to sign up.
p243_075.txt|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243_076.txt|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243_077.txt|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243_078.txt|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243_079.txt|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243_080.txt|They said our costs were too high.
p243_081.txt|I do not attempt to answer that.
p243_082.txt|It's been a great evening for us.
p243_083.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243_084.txt|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243_085.txt|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p243_086.txt|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p243_087.txt|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243_088.txt|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243_089.txt|I feel I did not have enough time.
p243_090.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p243_091.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243_092.txt|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p243_093.txt|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p243_094.txt|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p243_095.txt|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243_096.txt|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243_097.txt|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243_098.txt|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243_099.txt|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243_100.txt|I am delighted to hear this news.
p243_101.txt|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243_102.txt|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243_103.txt|We were under a bit of pressure.
p243_104.txt|They won't actually make any money from it.
p243_105.txt|I bought a flat six years ago.
p243_106.txt|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243_107.txt|They are a different team at home.
p243_108.txt|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243_109.txt|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243_110.txt|Some young girls also came by last night.
p243_111.txt|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243_112.txt|What are they for ?
p243_113.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p243_114.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115.txt|So what happens next ?
p243_116.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p243_117.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p243_118.txt|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p243_119.txt|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243_120.txt|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243_121.txt|They have no real friends in the region.
p243_122.txt|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243_123.txt|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243_125.txt|I think there's not much between them.
p243_126.txt|So I am going in the right direction.
p243_127.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243_128.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p243_129.txt|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243_130.txt|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p243_131.txt|He's got to look after himself now.
p243_132.txt|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243_133.txt|No country has a similar training programme.
p243_134.txt|There is no future in rock music.
p243_135.txt|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243_136.txt|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p243_137.txt|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243_138.txt|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243_139.txt|The programme has been made with great care.
p243_140.txt|There was only one living room, you see.
p243_141.txt|I am not under any new pressure.
p243_142.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p243_143.txt|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243_144.txt|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243_145.txt|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243_146.txt|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p243_147.txt|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243_148.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243_149.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p243_150.txt|Did he trip ?
p243_151.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152.txt|Did it work ?
p243_153.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154.txt|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243_155.txt|Time may already have run out for this option.
p243_156.txt|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243_157.txt|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243_158.txt|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243_159.txt|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243_160.txt|A progress report will be published in October.
p243_161.txt|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p243_162.txt|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p243_163.txt|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243_164.txt|Surely it can't run for two years.
p243_165.txt|But the game is still wide open.
p243_166.txt|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p243_167.txt|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p243_168.txt|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243_169.txt|We had to work very hard for our points.
p243_170.txt|That is a big risk at any price.
p243_171.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243_172.txt|He said some things which were better left alone.
p243_173.txt|If successful, several records will be made.
p243_174.txt|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243_175.txt|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p243_176.txt|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243_177.txt|It's just a different way of life.
p243_178.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243_179.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p243_180.txt|I am secure in my own position.
p243_181.txt|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p243_182.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p243_183.txt|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p243_184.txt|We have come a long way since then.
p243_185.txt|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243_186.txt|A great player has to win major championships.
p243_187.txt|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243_188.txt|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p243_189.txt|The story was not made public by this club.
p243_190.txt|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243_191.txt|You are not long home from work.
p243_192.txt|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243_193.txt|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243_194.txt|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243_195.txt|And they were being paid ?
p243_196.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p243_197.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p243_198.txt|But they had to be paid for.
p243_199.txt|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243_200.txt|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243_201.txt|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243_202.txt|I've never had a year like this.
p243_203.txt|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243_204.txt|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243_205.txt|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243_206.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243_207.txt|I want an answer from the British Government.
p243_208.txt|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243_209.txt|They are a victim of their own success.
p243_210.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243_211.txt|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243_212.txt|It is going to change the world.
p243_213.txt|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243_214.txt|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243_215.txt|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243_216.txt|I am not going to judge them.
p243_217.txt|I do not see this so much as failure.
p243_218.txt|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243_219.txt|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p243_220.txt|I was independent but I am not now.
p243_221.txt|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p243_222.txt|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243_223.txt|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243_224.txt|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p243_225.txt|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p243_227.txt|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243_228.txt|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243_229.txt|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p243_230.txt|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243_231.txt|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243_232.txt|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243_233.txt|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243_234.txt|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p243_235.txt|You are not allowed to do that.
p243_236.txt|That is the last thing they need.
p243_237.txt|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243_238.txt|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p243_239.txt|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243_240.txt|Was it the wife ?
p243_241.txt|Why change it ?
p243_242.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p243_243.txt|Does the name matter ?
p243_244.txt|how do you get it back ?
p243_245.txt|What are you not good at ?
p243_246.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p243_247.txt|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243_248.txt|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p243_249.txt|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243_250.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243_251.txt|However, the figures tell a different story.
p243_252.txt|The rise has come too late for some.
p243_253.txt|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243_254.txt|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p243_255.txt|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p243_256.txt|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243_257.txt|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243_258.txt|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p243_259.txt|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243_260.txt|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p243_261.txt|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243_262.txt|There would be a north and south division.
p243_263.txt|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p243_264.txt|The two companies were not for sale.
p243_265.txt|His condition was described as serious last night.
p243_266.txt|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243_267.txt|The board do not own the company.
p243_268.txt|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p243_269.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p243_270.txt|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p243_271.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p243_272.txt|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243_273.txt|I think I was about four years old.
p243_274.txt|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243_275.txt|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243_276.txt|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243_277.txt|I think the shares are good value.
p243_278.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p243_279.txt|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p243_280.txt|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p243_281.txt|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243_282.txt|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p243_283.txt|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243_284.txt|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p243_286.txt|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243_287.txt|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p243_288.txt|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243_289.txt|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p243_290.txt|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243_291.txt|He would get into any world team.
p243_292.txt|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243_293.txt|They first met during a Step in London.
p243_294.txt|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243_295.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243_296.txt|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p243_297.txt|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243_298.txt|It is based on population rather than need.
p243_299.txt|He could understand both points of view.
p243_300.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p243_301.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p243_302.txt|And does it ?
p243_303.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p243_304.txt|Had I heard ?
p243_305.txt|What happened in that game ?
p243_306.txt|Are you going to win ?
p243_308.txt|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243_309.txt|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243_310.txt|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243_311.txt|He is keen to stay in public service.
p243_312.txt|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243_313.txt|For that reason cover should not be given.
p243_314.txt|He felt too close to head office.
p243_315.txt|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243_316.txt|A report on their property is due within days.
p243_317.txt|He will just go on doing his job.
p243_318.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p243_319.txt|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243_320.txt|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243_321.txt|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243_322.txt|We will not simply hit these people.
p243_323.txt|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243_324.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p243_325.txt|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p243_326.txt|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p243_327.txt|I try to be open to experience.
p243_328.txt|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p243_329.txt|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243_330.txt|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p243_331.txt|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243_332.txt|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243_333.txt|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243_334.txt|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p243_335.txt|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243_336.txt|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243_337.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p243_338.txt|How are you, sir ?
p243_339.txt|So is that it, then ?
p243_340.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p243_341.txt|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p243_342.txt|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p243_343.txt|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243_344.txt|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243_345.txt|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243_346.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p243_347.txt|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243_348.txt|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p243_349.txt|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243_350.txt|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243_352.txt|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p243_353.txt|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243_354.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p243_355.txt|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243_356.txt|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p243_357.txt|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243_358.txt|His style was direct and very human.
p243_359.txt|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243_360.txt|They have the cash and the fire power.
p243_361.txt|The institute board will take the decision.
p243_362.txt|He's young enough and he must learn.
p243_363.txt|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p243_364.txt|Both players gave so much to the side.
p243_365.txt|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243_366.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p243_367.txt|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243_368.txt|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243_369.txt|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243_370.txt|I have come here to show support for the families.
p243_371.txt|We have been going for three years.
p243_372.txt|He really played us into a corner.
p243_373.txt|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243_374.txt|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243_375.txt|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p243_376.txt|It used to be all hard sell.
p243_377.txt|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243_378.txt|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243_379.txt|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p243_380.txt|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243_381.txt|This is not a small amount of money.
p243_382.txt|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243_383.txt|I just felt that I was broken down.
p243_384.txt|What do we do ?
p243_385.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p243_386.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p243_387.txt|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p243_388.txt|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243_389.txt|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p243_390.txt|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243_391.txt|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p243_392.txt|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p243_393.txt|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243_394.txt|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243_395.txt|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p243_396.txt|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243_397.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p243_398.txt|People have a wish to charge twice.
p244_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p244_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p244_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p244_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p244_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p244_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p244_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p244_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p244_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p244_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p244_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p244_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p244_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p244_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p244_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p244_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p244_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p244_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p244_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p244_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p244_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p244_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p244_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p244_025.txt|We are a service industry.
p244_026.txt|It may be good for the soul.
p244_027.txt|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p244_029.txt|It is about investing in the future.
p244_030.txt|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p244_031.txt|They were in good humour, too.
p244_032.txt|The end result is the same.
p244_033.txt|It is on the internet.
p244_034.txt|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244_035.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p244_036.txt|This is a central issue.
p244_037.txt|History is in the making.
p244_038.txt|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p244_039.txt|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p244_040.txt|She was at the top.
p244_041.txt|In London today, it was business as usual.
p244_042.txt|And they had a case.
p244_043.txt|Something has to be put in place.
p244_044.txt|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p244_045.txt|They are going after them.
p244_046.txt|It is all about the story.
p244_047.txt|The whole thing is the music.
p244_048.txt|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p244_049.txt|That is still the case.
p244_050.txt|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244_051.txt|In my view, it has to be done.
p244_052.txt|The pressure on the players will build.
p244_053.txt|Their campaign is in disarray.
p244_054.txt|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p244_055.txt|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p244_056.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p244_057.txt|Clearly, they had other problems.
p244_058.txt|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p244_059.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p244_060.txt|We have got to deliver.
p244_061.txt|That was the difference today.
p244_062.txt|The company continues to grow.
p244_063.txt|He said it was for sale.
p244_064.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p244_065.txt|That is all in the past.
p244_066.txt|There is a lot to be done.
p244_067.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p244_068.txt|He has not been dropped.
p244_069.txt|It was an outstanding performance.
p244_070.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244_071.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p244_072.txt|It is only the beginning.
p244_073.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p244_074.txt|Only water is currently allowed.
p244_075.txt|This time, it might be for real.
p244_076.txt|She did that for the rest of her life.
p244_077.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p244_078.txt|That will be the office.
p244_079.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p244_080.txt|How are you, sir ?
p244_081.txt|So is that it, then ?
p244_082.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p244_083.txt|What do we do ?
p244_084.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p244_085.txt|It starts with the script.
p244_086.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244_087.txt|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244_088.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p244_089.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p244_090.txt|It seems a good thing to try.
p244_091.txt|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244_092.txt|It sounds a lot of money.
p244_093.txt|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p244_094.txt|It is not a story.
p244_095.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244_096.txt|He is in the US.
p244_097.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p244_098.txt|It took an option on the process.
p244_099.txt|By then, he was walking on water.
p244_100.txt|This is a game of confidence.
p244_101.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p244_102.txt|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p244_103.txt|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244_104.txt|The trick is to try it.
p244_105.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244_106.txt|Victory was never in doubt.
p244_107.txt|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244_108.txt|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244_109.txt|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p244_110.txt|Then again, we could have.
p244_111.txt|There, you were just a body.
p244_112.txt|But he has not become a monster.
p244_113.txt|He is not a dancer.
p244_114.txt|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244_115.txt|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p244_116.txt|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244_117.txt|This is a sea change in approach.
p244_118.txt|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p244_119.txt|The procedures were not in place.
p244_120.txt|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p244_121.txt|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p244_122.txt|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244_123.txt|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244_124.txt|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p244_125.txt|We had a great time.
p244_126.txt|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244_127.txt|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244_128.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p244_129.txt|He wanted to record the group.
p244_130.txt|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p244_131.txt|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244_132.txt|It is hard to believe.
p244_133.txt|Or it would have been.
p244_134.txt|Three days later, he was killed.
p244_135.txt|Football is a passion for many.
p244_136.txt|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p244_137.txt|So, did she meet him ?
p244_138.txt|So what is the campaign about ?
p244_139.txt|And does it ?
p244_140.txt|Are you from the rugby ?
p244_141.txt|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244_142.txt|That was the first step.
p244_143.txt|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244_144.txt|I have been in contact with him.
p244_145.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p244_146.txt|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p244_147.txt|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p244_148.txt|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244_149.txt|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p244_150.txt|There were no grounds for his action.
p244_151.txt|I can't even get into the A team.
p244_152.txt|It starts at the top.
p244_153.txt|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244_154.txt|She does not want to speak.
p244_155.txt|It was all for good reason as well.
p244_156.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p244_157.txt|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244_158.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p244_159.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p244_160.txt|We want to get there.
p244_161.txt|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244_162.txt|There is a lack of staff.
p244_163.txt|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244_164.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p244_165.txt|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244_166.txt|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p244_167.txt|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244_168.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244_169.txt|Anyone can do the sums.
p244_170.txt|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244_171.txt|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p244_172.txt|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p244_173.txt|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244_174.txt|Like the others, he was arrested.
p244_175.txt|All the pressure was on him.
p244_176.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p244_177.txt|They have not been named.
p244_178.txt|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p244_179.txt|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244_180.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p244_181.txt|I was always in control.
p244_182.txt|It was by the numbers.
p244_183.txt|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p244_184.txt|It should never have happened.
p244_185.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p244_186.txt|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244_187.txt|It is difficult to say.
p244_188.txt|That is a question for the next manager.
p244_189.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p244_190.txt|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244_191.txt|It is simply not true.
p244_192.txt|Are you going to win ?
p244_193.txt|Was it the wife ?
p244_194.txt|Why change it ?
p244_195.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p244_196.txt|Does the name matter ?
p244_197.txt|That you can do it.
p244_198.txt|I would like to continue to develop.
p244_199.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p244_200.txt|He has defended the system.
p244_201.txt|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244_203.txt|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p244_204.txt|It is not an issue.
p244_205.txt|They have to get that sorted.
p244_206.txt|We can take the city.
p244_207.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p244_208.txt|It was the story of the second half.
p244_209.txt|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244_210.txt|As many as the market will support.
p244_211.txt|He is believed to live in Britain.
p244_212.txt|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p244_213.txt|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p244_214.txt|This conference was never confirmed.
p244_215.txt|A team is a team.
p244_216.txt|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p244_217.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p244_218.txt|It decided to blame the media.
p244_219.txt|THE force is with them.
p244_220.txt|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244_221.txt|It was important to win today.
p244_222.txt|He was not injured in the attack.
p244_223.txt|Because he was born in England.
p244_224.txt|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244_225.txt|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244_226.txt|I was not overly concerned about this.
p244_227.txt|However, it is not as simple as this.
p244_228.txt|We want this place to work.
p244_229.txt|It still has an effect.
p244_230.txt|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244_231.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p244_232.txt|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244_233.txt|There is a lot of concern.
p244_234.txt|It will be decided in the next month.
p244_235.txt|We have to win the group.
p244_236.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244_237.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p244_238.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p244_239.txt|There was a lot of resentment.
p244_240.txt|This is a fight to the death.
p244_241.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p244_242.txt|He is a man of the people.
p244_243.txt|The matter is under appeal.
p244_244.txt|And they were being paid ?
p244_245.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p244_246.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p244_247.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p244_248.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p244_249.txt|Did he trip ?
p244_250.txt|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244_251.txt|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244_252.txt|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244_253.txt|Instead, he missed the lot.
p244_254.txt|I was never in danger.
p244_255.txt|A lot has been written.
p244_256.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p244_257.txt|It was really good in the first week.
p244_258.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p244_259.txt|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244_260.txt|That is not the case in Europe.
p244_261.txt|But it was a loss.
p244_262.txt|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p244_263.txt|The performance continues to improve.
p244_264.txt|It expected this trend to continue.
p244_265.txt|However, no further action was taken by police.
p244_266.txt|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p244_267.txt|But we were in control at that point.
p244_268.txt|It has to be enforced.
p244_269.txt|The party has never fully recovered.
p244_270.txt|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p244_271.txt|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244_272.txt|He must have a crack at it.
p244_273.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p244_274.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p244_275.txt|He was good, but not that good.
p244_276.txt|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p244_277.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p244_278.txt|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244_279.txt|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p244_280.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p244_281.txt|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p244_282.txt|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p244_283.txt|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244_284.txt|It is important that he is involved.
p244_285.txt|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p244_286.txt|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244_287.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244_288.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p244_290.txt|I should think so, too.
p244_291.txt|None of the agencies was able to help.
p244_292.txt|I didn't see the point.
p244_293.txt|This idea has been around for four years.
p244_294.txt|We are in a war.
p244_295.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296.txt|Is our children learning ?
p244_297.txt|How independent is that ?
p244_298.txt|What form did that take ?
p244_299.txt|Are they free ?
p244_300.txt|Scotland won by six wickets.
p244_301.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244_302.txt|This is a historic agreement.
p244_303.txt|We have to be realistic.
p244_304.txt|Every one is a winner.
p244_305.txt|There was a hole in it.
p244_306.txt|It will be done in stages.
p244_307.txt|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244_308.txt|Every character was completely different.
p244_309.txt|But it is a similar problem.
p244_310.txt|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244_311.txt|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p244_312.txt|In that moment, I was happy.
p244_313.txt|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p244_314.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p244_315.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p244_316.txt|It involved the same people.
p244_317.txt|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p244_318.txt|We have to be very, very careful.
p244_319.txt|Look at the potential of this club.
p244_320.txt|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p244_321.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p244_322.txt|We did something about it.
p244_323.txt|But it is up again.
p244_324.txt|However, the devil is in the detail.
p244_325.txt|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p244_326.txt|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244_327.txt|He is already in place.
p244_328.txt|Another difference is the cost.
p244_329.txt|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244_330.txt|And we can do it.
p244_331.txt|What are they for ?
p244_333.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p244_335.txt|And it's a goodbye from him.
p244_336.txt|It is a sensitive issue.
p244_337.txt|They have to be addressed.
p244_338.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p244_339.txt|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p244_340.txt|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244_341.txt|However, a bid was never made.
p244_342.txt|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244_343.txt|Something is going to have to give.
p244_344.txt|And the context is also completely different.
p244_345.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p244_346.txt|The banking sector was weak.
p244_347.txt|But the New Year was special.
p244_348.txt|We never played at all.
p244_349.txt|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p244_350.txt|This isn't the end of story.
p244_351.txt|He is a great prospect.
p244_352.txt|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244_353.txt|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244_354.txt|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244_355.txt|This latter suggestion is very important.
p244_356.txt|However, it does not tell the full story.
p244_357.txt|They were impressive against France.
p244_358.txt|The challenge is to win a cup.
p244_359.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p244_360.txt|It was a test in itself.
p244_361.txt|Either team will be hard.
p244_362.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p244_363.txt|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p244_364.txt|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244_365.txt|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p244_366.txt|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p244_367.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p244_368.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244_369.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p244_370.txt|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p244_371.txt|I have a good feeling about this.
p244_372.txt|The news is not all bad.
p244_373.txt|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244_374.txt|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244_375.txt|It is almost certain to be the last.
p244_376.txt|You have to be patient.
p244_377.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244_378.txt|I was delighted to accept.
p244_379.txt|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p244_380.txt|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244_381.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p244_382.txt|It's fantastic to win again.
p244_383.txt|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p244_384.txt|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244_385.txt|Everything is in the mix.
p244_386.txt|An announcement is expected this week.
p244_387.txt|He will be difficult to replace.
p244_388.txt|I would be interested in another attempt.
p244_389.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p244_390.txt|He was on a mission.
p244_391.txt|Does it matter ?
p244_392.txt|How do you take them away ?
p244_393.txt|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p244_394.txt|After the match, do you ?
p244_395.txt|One-third of the places are already taken.
p244_396.txt|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p244_397.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p244_398.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p244_399.txt|I want this one to be different.
p244_400.txt|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244_401.txt|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p244_402.txt|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p244_403.txt|He is a quality player.
p244_404.txt|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p244_405.txt|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244_406.txt|There is a demand for it.
p244_407.txt|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244_408.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p244_409.txt|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p244_410.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244_411.txt|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244_412.txt|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244_413.txt|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p244_414.txt|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p244_415.txt|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p244_416.txt|There is no need to panic.
p244_417.txt|It had been on the cards.
p244_418.txt|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244_419.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p244_420.txt|That might mean another delay.
p244_421.txt|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p244_422.txt|I am delighted for them.
p244_423.txt|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244_424.txt|But it was a struggle.
p252_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p252_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p252_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p252_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p252_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p252_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p252_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p252_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p252_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p252_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p252_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p252_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p252_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p252_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p252_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p252_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p252_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p252_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p252_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
p252_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p252_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p252_025.txt|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252_026.txt|This would include insurance.
p252_027.txt|It would fit very well with us.
p252_028.txt|He does not even trust his own members.
p252_029.txt|Do not give your details to anyone.
p252_030.txt|Schools do not create that.
p252_032.txt|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252_033.txt|Just look at his fashion sense.
p252_034.txt|I have every confidence.
p252_035.txt|He added that her comments were noted.
p252_036.txt|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252_037.txt|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252_038.txt|That time may never be broken.
p252_039.txt|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252_040.txt|He too started on the subs seats.
p252_041.txt|I'm so happy that she did.
p252_042.txt|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p252_043.txt|This operation will change her life.
p252_044.txt|Something old something new, as it were.
p252_045.txt|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252_046.txt|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252_047.txt|That's what set him apart.
p252_048.txt|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252_050.txt|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252_051.txt|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252_052.txt|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252_053.txt|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252_054.txt|Schools will not want change.
p252_055.txt|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252_056.txt|He was failed by his health authority.
p252_057.txt|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252_058.txt|I agree with you about this.
p252_059.txt|Or so he thought.
p252_060.txt|Must be prepared to use it.
p252_061.txt|The fifth was found later.
p252_062.txt|For a decade she was proved right.
p252_063.txt|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p252_064.txt|Our people are ready.
p252_065.txt|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252_066.txt|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252_067.txt|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252_068.txt|People come to see the Highlands.
p252_069.txt|It would have to be.
p252_071.txt|This is a great opportunity for us.
p252_072.txt|That is not possible.
p252_073.txt|None has ever been found.
p252_074.txt|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252_075.txt|Their time has gone.
p252_076.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p252_077.txt|How are you, sir ?
p252_078.txt|So is that it, then ?
p252_079.txt|Do I have a favourite ?
p252_080.txt|What do we do ?
p252_081.txt|Why do it otherwise ?
p252_082.txt|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
p252_083.txt|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252_084.txt|He has a real potential.
p252_085.txt|LET there be light.
p252_086.txt|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252_087.txt|Scotland has great assets.
p252_088.txt|That remains the same.
p252_089.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p252_090.txt|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p252_091.txt|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252_092.txt|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p252_093.txt|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252_094.txt|The car driver died.
p252_095.txt|It looks that way.
p252_096.txt|Now comes the hard part.
p252_097.txt|We are already seeing some positive results.
p252_098.txt|We're at home, which is important.
p252_099.txt|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252_100.txt|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p252_101.txt|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252_102.txt|They had three children.
p252_103.txt|Some young girls also came by last night.
p252_104.txt|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p252_105.txt|It would be easy to think so.
p252_106.txt|And so it went on.
p252_108.txt|Scotland were on Saturday.
p252_109.txt|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252_110.txt|He gets his moment.
p252_111.txt|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p252_112.txt|There was no reason.
p252_113.txt|It gets too much.
p252_114.txt|So they should be.
p252_115.txt|No progress has been made.
p252_116.txt|They need the money.
p252_117.txt|That is the only way to rate players.
p252_118.txt|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252_119.txt|Its failure is no surprise.
p252_120.txt|No country has a similar training programme.
p252_121.txt|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p252_122.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p252_123.txt|They pointed to the site.
p252_124.txt|Tony Blair said as little.
p252_125.txt|He is at peace with himself.
p252_126.txt|Gold admitted as much.
p252_127.txt|It seemed like four hours.
p252_128.txt|Evidence must not be held back.
p252_129.txt|We beat the Welsh team.
p252_130.txt|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252_131.txt|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252_132.txt|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p252_133.txt|Eight others have followed.
p252_134.txt|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252_135.txt|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p252_136.txt|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252_137.txt|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252_138.txt|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p252_139.txt|It should have its own network.
p252_140.txt|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p252_141.txt|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252_142.txt|That shows the impact it had.
p252_143.txt|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p252_144.txt|I'd always wanted to act.
p252_145.txt|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252_146.txt|That is a big risk at any price.
p252_147.txt|I am never fully fit.
p252_148.txt|Are you going to win ?
p252_149.txt|Was it the wife ?
p252_150.txt|Why change it ?
p252_151.txt|What do we want to do that for ?
p252_152.txt|Does the name matter ?
p252_153.txt|how do you get it back ?
p252_154.txt|What are you not good at ?
p252_155.txt|I think, therefore I am ?
p252_156.txt|Who was she ?
p252_157.txt|He said some things which were better left alone.
p252_158.txt|He nearly killed my son.
p252_160.txt|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252_161.txt|I told them during their morning break.
p252_162.txt|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252_163.txt|Mr Dewar understood that.
p252_164.txt|Nato has left them with no other option.
p252_165.txt|They have shown great character.
p252_166.txt|I am secure in my own position.
p252_167.txt|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252_168.txt|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252_169.txt|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p252_170.txt|The second failed completely.
p252_171.txt|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252_172.txt|We have come a long way since then.
p252_173.txt|Sport is good for you.
p252_174.txt|It was clearly not a battle.
p252_175.txt|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252_176.txt|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252_177.txt|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252_178.txt|All options are available.
p252_179.txt|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252_181.txt|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252_182.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p252_183.txt|I've no idea how it works.
p252_184.txt|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252_185.txt|Maybe this battle had been.
p252_186.txt|Art can challenge our value system.
p252_187.txt|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252_188.txt|London remained the favourite.
p252_189.txt|I've never had a year like this.
p252_190.txt|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252_191.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p252_193.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252_194.txt|A child is not a product.
p252_195.txt|Which can happen any time.
p252_196.txt|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p252_197.txt|Now he is back on top again.
p252_198.txt|The hotel was huge.
p252_199.txt|And they were being paid ?
p252_200.txt|was everything done to save people ?
p252_201.txt|What was the matter for concern ?
p252_202.txt|Do I think about them often ?
p252_203.txt|Is it in the right place ?
p252_204.txt|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p252_205.txt|This should begin in October.
p252_206.txt|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p252_207.txt|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p252_208.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p252_209.txt|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252_210.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p252_211.txt|Their bodies were never found.
p252_212.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p252_213.txt|Business will continue as usual.
p252_214.txt|I want a free vote.
p252_215.txt|Fine, said the press officer.
p252_216.txt|The questions came quick and fast.
p252_217.txt|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252_218.txt|Her experience is certainly limited.
p252_219.txt|We tried four banks.
p252_220.txt|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p252_221.txt|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p252_222.txt|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252_223.txt|Brian was last to join.
p252_224.txt|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p252_225.txt|Now the door has opened.
p252_226.txt|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p252_227.txt|Her death is a huge blow.
p252_228.txt|The global market was about flat.
p252_229.txt|Three hit the target.
p252_230.txt|The idea is simple.
p252_231.txt|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p252_232.txt|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252_233.txt|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252_234.txt|We know the problems.
p252_235.txt|Britain will be little affected.
p252_236.txt|There is a good reason for this.
p252_237.txt|You know the type.
p252_238.txt|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252_239.txt|The board do not own the company.
p252_240.txt|That time is not far away.
p252_241.txt|That's been the difference between the sides.
p252_242.txt|When I was training.
p252_243.txt|I did let myself down a bit.
p252_244.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p252_245.txt|This is absolutely not true.
p252_246.txt|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p252_247.txt|It was a great evening.
p252_248.txt|We have several options.
p252_250.txt|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252_251.txt|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252_252.txt|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252_253.txt|It is based on population rather than need.
p252_254.txt|We were leading by two goals.
p252_255.txt|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p252_256.txt|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252_258.txt|It was an accident.
p252_260.txt|My goals have never changed.
p252_262.txt|So we kept them waiting.
p252_263.txt|He makes time for everyone.
p252_264.txt|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252_265.txt|The proposal was rejected.
p252_266.txt|Look at a computer.
p252_267.txt|He did better then.
p252_268.txt|But the next day she paid for it.
p252_269.txt|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p252_270.txt|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252_271.txt|This was the perfect setting.
p252_273.txt|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p252_274.txt|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252_275.txt|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p252_276.txt|All films open tomorrow
p252_277.txt|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p252_278.txt|Paul never gave up hope.
p252_279.txt|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252_280.txt|They bought the property four years ago.
p252_281.txt|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252_282.txt|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252_283.txt|It is a dangerous sport.
p252_284.txt|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252_286.txt|The future might well be green after all.
p252_287.txt|They were seriously after him.
p252_288.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p252_289.txt|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p252_290.txt|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252_291.txt|I'm interested in interesting work.
p252_292.txt|His season started this afternoon.
p252_293.txt|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p252_294.txt|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252_295.txt|Kenny and I are ready.
p252_296.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p252_297.txt|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252_298.txt|They have played their part.
p252_299.txt|He followed the Italian route.
p252_300.txt|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252_301.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p252_302.txt|So does every industry.
p252_303.txt|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252_304.txt|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252_305.txt|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252_306.txt|We must move on.
p252_307.txt|It's just an area of water.
p252_308.txt|We have achieved that.
p252_309.txt|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252_310.txt|Good players have become bad.
p252_311.txt|Many events are down on numbers.
p252_312.txt|He had served his time.
p252_313.txt|It was a total surprise.
p252_314.txt|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252_315.txt|The process will start tomorrow.
p252_316.txt|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252_317.txt|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p252_319.txt|One finding emerged clearly.
p252_320.txt|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252_321.txt|We lost to a poor team.
p252_322.txt|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p252_323.txt|We have clearly become well established.
p252_324.txt|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p252_325.txt|Murray plays down return
p252_326.txt|Other teams moved up too.
p252_327.txt|Not one person spoke badly.
p252_328.txt|We were caught out.
p252_329.txt|The performance continues to improve.
p252_330.txt|We want immediate action.
p252_331.txt|Our relationship has been very good.
p252_332.txt|Someone should tell them.
p252_333.txt|But it won't help British farmers.
p252_334.txt|Does that put pressure on us ?
p252_335.txt|Did it work ?
p252_336.txt|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p252_337.txt|Is our children learning ?
p252_338.txt|How independent is that ?
p252_339.txt|Because I think it's there.
p252_340.txt|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252_341.txt|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252_342.txt|They will now remain split up.
p252_343.txt|We are a husband and wife team.
p252_344.txt|It was the September weekend after all.
p252_345.txt|He would add value.
p252_346.txt|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p252_347.txt|Those overseas offices were great.
p252_348.txt|That was our last chance to do something.
p252_349.txt|Maybe she is right.
p252_350.txt|I saw one man vote five times.
p252_351.txt|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p252_352.txt|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252_353.txt|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252_354.txt|Any increase always has some effect.
p252_355.txt|What form did that take ?
p252_356.txt|Are they free ?
p252_357.txt|What are they for ?
p252_358.txt|Is there a waiting list ?
p252_359.txt|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p252_360.txt|They had better be.
p252_361.txt|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252_362.txt|He was a great human being.
p252_363.txt|That seems highly unlikely.
p252_364.txt|Still, I am delighted.
p252_365.txt|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252_366.txt|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252_367.txt|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252_368.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p252_369.txt|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252_370.txt|The whole system is too complex.
p252_371.txt|He said legal action could be considered.
p252_372.txt|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252_373.txt|This is far too high.
p252_374.txt|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252_375.txt|If you believe in the blue and white.
p252_376.txt|We have no information on Iraq.
p252_378.txt|The referee faces a massive job.
p252_379.txt|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252_380.txt|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252_381.txt|An appeal was unlikely.
p252_382.txt|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252_383.txt|I got dropped for that game.
p252_384.txt|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252_385.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p252_386.txt|This year I understood.
p252_387.txt|It's clearly a budget.
p252_388.txt|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252_389.txt|The women are victims here.
p252_390.txt|I'm not sure that's right.
p252_391.txt|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252_392.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p252_393.txt|There's nothing natural left.
p252_394.txt|He could still be President.
p252_395.txt|There's always a case.
p252_396.txt|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p252_397.txt|He has worked hard over the years.
p252_399.txt|It was too difficult.
p252_400.txt|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252_401.txt|I managed to do that.
p252_402.txt|So what happens next ?
p252_403.txt|Had this been common practice ?
p252_404.txt|What do they want us to do ?
p252_405.txt|Is it worth it ?
p252_406.txt|Does it matter ?
p252_407.txt|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252_408.txt|They had to have hospital treatment.
p252_409.txt|Five local people were injured.
p252_410.txt|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252_411.txt|I'd like to report a murder.
p254_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p254_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p254_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p254_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p254_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p254_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p254_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p254_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p254_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p254_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p254_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p254_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p254_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p254_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p254_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p254_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p254_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p254_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p254_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p254_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p254_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p254_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p254_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p254_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p254_025.txt|Johnson was pretty low.
p254_026.txt|But it failed.
p254_027.txt|They may be wrong.
p254_028.txt|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p254_029.txt|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254_030.txt|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254_031.txt|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254_032.txt|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p254_033.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p254_034.txt|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254_035.txt|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p254_037.txt|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p254_038.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254_039.txt|They're just different.
p254_040.txt|It was clear.
p254_041.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p254_042.txt|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254_043.txt|I was scared.
p254_044.txt|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p254_045.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p254_046.txt|That period was a struggle.
p254_047.txt|I am just going to go for it.
p254_048.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254_049.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p254_050.txt|It's a crucial award.
p254_051.txt|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254_052.txt|That should do it.
p254_053.txt|It's a blessing.
p254_054.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p254_055.txt|But it might have done.
p254_056.txt|That time has passed.
p254_057.txt|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p254_058.txt|He is too weak to move.
p254_059.txt|Life is good.
p254_060.txt|It is the whole package.
p254_061.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p254_062.txt|He had no enemies.
p254_063.txt|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p254_064.txt|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p254_065.txt|That's the day job.
p254_066.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p254_067.txt|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254_068.txt|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254_069.txt|My mother is a widow.
p254_070.txt|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p254_071.txt|Jobs could go.
p254_072.txt|Four other charges were dropped.
p254_073.txt|They're appalled by that.
p254_074.txt|There was a battle there.
p254_075.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p254_076.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p254_078.txt|They never gave up hope.
p254_079.txt|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254_080.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p254_081.txt|It's all I can do.
p254_082.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p254_083.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p254_084.txt|The price cuts are really exciting.
p254_085.txt|My office is bare.
p254_086.txt|Is there a new way forward?
p254_087.txt|There was an e-mail.
p254_088.txt|Even the one she loved.
p254_090.txt|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254_091.txt|It may well have been.
p254_092.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254_093.txt|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254_094.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p254_095.txt|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254_096.txt|All options are open.
p254_097.txt|You will be.
p254_098.txt|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p254_099.txt|And rugby fans can help.
p254_100.txt|Now the system is right behind us.
p254_101.txt|However, it did not end that way.
p254_102.txt|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p254_103.txt|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254_104.txt|I love the Dome.
p254_105.txt|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p254_106.txt|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254_107.txt|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p254_108.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p254_109.txt|But it was a pleasure.
p254_110.txt|He takes the job.
p254_111.txt|It was an adventure.
p254_112.txt|That all hope is never lost.
p254_113.txt|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254_114.txt|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p254_115.txt|It is normal.
p254_116.txt|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p254_117.txt|We need to handle it.
p254_118.txt|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p254_119.txt|It's a long process.
p254_120.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p254_121.txt|The fire was above the hole.
p254_122.txt|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254_123.txt|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254_124.txt|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254_125.txt|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254_126.txt|I joined a group.
p254_127.txt|Does this mean.
p254_128.txt|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254_129.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p254_130.txt|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254_131.txt|I'm so angry.
p254_132.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254_133.txt|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254_134.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254_135.txt|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254_136.txt|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254_137.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p254_138.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p254_139.txt|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p254_140.txt|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p254_141.txt|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254_143.txt|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p254_144.txt|Three penalties were given.
p254_145.txt|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p254_146.txt|He is severe.
p254_147.txt|It is difficult for Ali.
p254_148.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p254_149.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p254_150.txt|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254_151.txt|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254_152.txt|It is not just about pay.
p254_153.txt|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254_154.txt|You know the type.
p254_155.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p254_156.txt|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254_157.txt|I was in daily contact.
p254_158.txt|We will turn the corner.
p254_159.txt|This latter point is hugely important.
p254_160.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p254_161.txt|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p254_162.txt|He's a nice guy.
p254_163.txt|It has to be now.
p254_164.txt|They are not advertised.
p254_165.txt|I have got a wife to feed.
p254_166.txt|Tell it like it was?
p254_167.txt|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p254_168.txt|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p254_169.txt|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254_170.txt|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p254_171.txt|He was a crazy man.
p254_172.txt|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p254_173.txt|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p254_174.txt|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p254_175.txt|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p254_176.txt|It is not either national standards or local control.
p254_177.txt|The clarity is vital.
p254_178.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p254_179.txt|Tony had arrived.
p254_180.txt|He will need that machine.
p254_181.txt|I was totally wrong.
p254_182.txt|We did everything by the book.
p254_183.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p254_184.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p254_185.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p254_186.txt|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p254_187.txt|Peace was won.
p254_188.txt|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p254_189.txt|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p254_190.txt|Off I went.
p254_191.txt|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254_192.txt|Is that it?
p254_193.txt|The conference is the first test.
p254_194.txt|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p254_195.txt|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254_196.txt|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p254_197.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p254_198.txt|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254_199.txt|Today was first class.
p254_200.txt|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254_201.txt|We have an election in eight days.
p254_202.txt|It's like a garage.
p254_203.txt|But I am a worried man.
p254_204.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254_205.txt|That is an important part of our role.
p254_206.txt|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254_207.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p254_208.txt|I began to pray.
p254_209.txt|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p254_210.txt|His third goal was superb.
p254_211.txt|It's not ideal.
p254_212.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p254_213.txt|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p254_214.txt|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254_215.txt|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254_216.txt|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p254_217.txt|You have to do your research.
p254_218.txt|Saturday is gone.
p254_219.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p254_220.txt|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p254_221.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254_222.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p254_223.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p254_224.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p254_225.txt|It's so special.
p254_226.txt|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254_227.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p254_228.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p254_229.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p254_230.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p254_231.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p254_232.txt|We were a load of rubbish.
p254_233.txt|They should come forward.
p254_234.txt|It is not the message alone.
p254_235.txt|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p254_236.txt|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254_237.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p254_238.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p254_239.txt|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p254_240.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p254_241.txt|They are all bright and different.
p254_242.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p254_243.txt|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p254_244.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254_245.txt|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p254_246.txt|He got the same story.
p254_247.txt|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254_248.txt|I was shocked.
p254_249.txt|He's a lovely young man.
p254_250.txt|There's the mix.
p254_251.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p254_252.txt|This year I understood.
p254_253.txt|That could be in place by next year.
p254_254.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p254_255.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p254_256.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254_257.txt|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254_258.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p254_259.txt|It is also very valuable.
p254_260.txt|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254_261.txt|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254_262.txt|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254_263.txt|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p254_264.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p254_265.txt|There is no link.
p254_266.txt|This is a question of Islam.
p254_267.txt|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254_268.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p254_269.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p254_270.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p254_271.txt|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p254_272.txt|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p254_273.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p254_275.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254_276.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p254_277.txt|It's a way of life.
p254_278.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p254_279.txt|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254_280.txt|People have no choice.
p254_281.txt|If not, he should go home.
p254_282.txt|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p254_283.txt|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254_284.txt|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254_285.txt|I saw it at a ruck.
p254_286.txt|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p254_287.txt|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p254_289.txt|The mood is good.
p254_290.txt|It's like a high school play.
p254_291.txt|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254_292.txt|This is a national crisis.
p254_293.txt|Well, he can do it.
p254_294.txt|These figures are truly awful.
p254_295.txt|That could change.
p254_296.txt|Who can predict?
p254_297.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p254_298.txt|One was a lawyer.
p254_299.txt|It is a road of death.
p254_300.txt|The plot is minimal.
p254_301.txt|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254_302.txt|I did not name it.
p254_303.txt|We have waited a long time for this.
p254_304.txt|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254_305.txt|They were fantastic.
p254_306.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p254_307.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p254_308.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p254_309.txt|My body is clearly capable.
p254_310.txt|It is out there.
p254_311.txt|He said she was mad.
p254_312.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p254_313.txt|We are in the end game.
p254_314.txt|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254_315.txt|It is a strong case.
p254_316.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p254_317.txt|Donald was his friend.
p254_318.txt|He was not a big name.
p254_319.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p254_320.txt|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p254_321.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p254_322.txt|It's not long enough.
p254_323.txt|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254_324.txt|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254_326.txt|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p254_327.txt|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254_329.txt|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254_330.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p254_331.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p254_332.txt|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254_333.txt|Today she has been released.
p254_334.txt|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254_335.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p254_336.txt|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p254_337.txt|It should be scrapped.
p254_338.txt|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254_339.txt|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254_340.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p254_341.txt|It is not like working for a living.
p254_342.txt|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p254_343.txt|It is long gone.
p254_344.txt|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254_345.txt|Tell us about it.
p254_346.txt|It's all going to clear the debt.
p254_347.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p254_348.txt|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p254_349.txt|It was very formal.
p254_350.txt|I kept going for her.
p254_351.txt|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p254_352.txt|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254_353.txt|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254_354.txt|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254_355.txt|We will be homeless.
p254_356.txt|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p254_357.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p254_358.txt|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254_359.txt|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254_360.txt|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254_361.txt|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254_362.txt|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254_363.txt|There was no option.
p254_364.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p254_365.txt|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p254_366.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254_367.txt|They received a reply from their own managers.
p254_368.txt|But I managed.
p254_369.txt|Five members were disciplined.
p254_370.txt|Talks are progressing.
p254_371.txt|They play together perfectly.
p254_372.txt|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254_373.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p254_374.txt|It became a national network.
p254_375.txt|It is a large number.
p254_376.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p254_377.txt|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254_378.txt|He has the edge.
p254_379.txt|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p254_380.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254_381.txt|Face to face
p254_382.txt|I am very happy with life.
p254_383.txt|I'm just enjoying every match.
p254_384.txt|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254_385.txt|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254_386.txt|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254_387.txt|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254_388.txt|They really did a great job.
p254_389.txt|At the last I found a bunker.
p254_390.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p254_391.txt|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254_392.txt|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254_393.txt|I'm pleased about one thing.
p254_394.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254_395.txt|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254_396.txt|We're looking for justice.
p254_397.txt|I can lead by example.
p254_398.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p254_399.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254_400.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p254_401.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p254_402.txt|The car was just there.
p254_403.txt|It was on fire.
p301_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p301_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p301_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p301_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p301_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p301_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p301_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p301_025.txt|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301_026.txt|They changed the world of music.
p301_027.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p301_028.txt|The law has got to be upheld.
p301_029.txt|But we're not the same person.
p301_030.txt|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301_031.txt|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p301_032.txt|The punishment was swift.
p301_033.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301_034.txt|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301_035.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301_036.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301_037.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p301_038.txt|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p301_039.txt|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301_040.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301_041.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p301_042.txt|I have played really well all year.

p301_047.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p301_048.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p301_049.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301_050.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301_051.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p301_052.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p301_053.txt|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301_054.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p301_055.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301_056.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p301_057.txt|I keep my fingers crossed.
p301_058.txt|The encounter was to change his life.
p301_059.txt|It's the best of both worlds.
p301_060.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301_061.txt|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p301_062.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p301_063.txt|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301_064.txt|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301_065.txt|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p301_066.txt|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p301_067.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p301_068.txt|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p301_069.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301_070.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p301_071.txt|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301_072.txt|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p301_073.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301_074.txt|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301_075.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301_076.txt|This is a mental challenge.
p301_077.txt|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301_078.txt|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p301_079.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301_080.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p301_081.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p301_082.txt|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p301_083.txt|Cars are great for going long distances.
p301_084.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p301_085.txt|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301_086.txt|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301_087.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p301_088.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p301_089.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301_090.txt|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301_091.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p301_092.txt|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301_093.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301_094.txt|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301_095.txt|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301_096.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p301_097.txt|He was married with a young child.
p301_098.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p301_099.txt|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301_100.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p301_101.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301_102.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p301_103.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p301_104.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301_105.txt|Is your life a little too easy?
p301_106.txt|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301_107.txt|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p301_108.txt|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301_109.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301_110.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p301_111.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p301_112.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301_113.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301_114.txt|He took away my childhood.
p301_115.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p301_116.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p301_117.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301_118.txt|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301_119.txt|It is not great art.
p301_120.txt|You do not change overnight.
p301_121.txt|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301_122.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p301_123.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p301_124.txt|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301_125.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p301_126.txt|Tony Blair should get out more.
p301_127.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p301_128.txt|He was just awesome.
p301_129.txt|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p301_130.txt|We need to move forward together.
p301_131.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p301_132.txt|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p301_133.txt|Both were later released after a check-up.
p301_134.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p301_135.txt|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p301_136.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p301_137.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301_138.txt|The son has autism and other problems.
p301_139.txt|I'm very puzzled by it.
p301_140.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301_141.txt|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p301_142.txt|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301_143.txt|All things are possible if you believe.
p301_144.txt|This was not just incongruous.
p301_145.txt|It is patently true.
p301_146.txt|You hope he prevails.
p301_147.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p301_148.txt|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301_149.txt|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p301_150.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p301_151.txt|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p301_152.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p301_153.txt|He was forced to quit.
p301_154.txt|It is good for their eyesight.
p301_155.txt|I was loving that little girl.
p301_156.txt|But you can't have it both ways.
p301_157.txt|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301_158.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p301_159.txt|The death toll included five children.
p301_160.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p301_161.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p301_162.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p301_163.txt|This is a United Kingdom.
p301_164.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p301_165.txt|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301_166.txt|However, who could have predicted this result?
p301_167.txt|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301_168.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p301_169.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p301_170.txt|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301_171.txt|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301_172.txt|The answer is mayhem.
p301_173.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p301_174.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p301_175.txt|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301_176.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p301_177.txt|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301_178.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p301_179.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p301_180.txt|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301_181.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p301_182.txt|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p301_183.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p301_184.txt|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301_185.txt|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301_186.txt|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p301_187.txt|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301_188.txt|I hope you miss the cut.
p301_189.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p301_190.txt|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p301_191.txt|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301_192.txt|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301_193.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p301_194.txt|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301_195.txt|Harold is a rarity.
p301_196.txt|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301_197.txt|I want him to take on Gomez.
p301_198.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p301_199.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p301_200.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301_201.txt|Well, what do you know?
p301_202.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301_203.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301_204.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301_205.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p301_206.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p301_207.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p301_208.txt|We have no choice but to shut down.
p301_209.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p301_210.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p301_211.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p301_212.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p301_213.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p301_214.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p301_215.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p301_216.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301_217.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p301_218.txt|These findings would be made public.
p301_219.txt|What are you not good at?
p301_220.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p301_221.txt|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p301_222.txt|This makes no sense!
p301_223.txt|I go home only once.
p301_224.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p301_225.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p301_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p301_227.txt|The team this year is going places.
p301_228.txt|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p301_229.txt|It took more than two years.
p301_230.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p301_231.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p301_232.txt|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301_233.txt|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301_234.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p301_235.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p301_236.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p301_237.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301_238.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p301_239.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p301_240.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301_241.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p301_242.txt|There are nine people here now.
p301_243.txt|His son is a local legend.
p301_244.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p301_245.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p301_246.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301_247.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p301_248.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p301_249.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301_250.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301_251.txt|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p301_252.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p301_253.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p301_254.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p301_255.txt|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p301_256.txt|Wagner was never like this.
p301_257.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301_258.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301_259.txt|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p301_260.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p301_261.txt|We're not travel agents.
p301_262.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301_263.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p301_264.txt|It's the same old story.
p301_265.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p301_266.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p301_267.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p301_268.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p301_269.txt|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301_270.txt|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301_271.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p301_272.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301_273.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p301_274.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p301_275.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p301_276.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p301_277.txt|Little Voice is on general release.
p301_278.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301_279.txt|There is no substitute.
p301_280.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p301_281.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p301_282.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p301_283.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301_284.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p301_285.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p301_286.txt|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p301_287.txt|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301_288.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p301_289.txt|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301_290.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p301_291.txt|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301_292.txt|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p301_293.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p301_294.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p301_295.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301_296.txt|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301_297.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p301_298.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p301_299.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p301_300.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p301_301.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p301_302.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p301_303.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p301_304.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p301_305.txt|That it is a brand name.
p301_306.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301_307.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p301_308.txt|They will have to make changes.
p301_309.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p301_310.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p301_311.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p301_312.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p301_313.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301_314.txt|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301_315.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p301_316.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p301_317.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p301_318.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301_319.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p301_320.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301_321.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301_322.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p301_323.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p301_324.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p301_325.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p301_326.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p301_327.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p301_328.txt|He is young but not too young.
p301_329.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p301_330.txt|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p301_331.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p301_332.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301_333.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p301_334.txt|There is no answer to it.
p301_335.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p301_336.txt|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301_337.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p301_338.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p301_339.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p301_340.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p301_341.txt|I am not putting myself down.
p301_342.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p301_343.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p301_344.txt|We were lucky to have survived.
p301_345.txt|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301_346.txt|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p301_347.txt|I just want to change my life.
p301_348.txt|He did not oppose the divorce.
p301_349.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p301_350.txt|And Michael was just great.
p301_351.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p301_352.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301_353.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p301_354.txt|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301_355.txt|That only came out during a radio interview.
p301_356.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p301_357.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p301_358.txt|We must not go down that road.
p301_359.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p301_360.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p301_361.txt|And that match was played in June.
p301_362.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p301_363.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301_364.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p301_365.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301_366.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p301_367.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p301_368.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p301_369.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p301_370.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p301_371.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p301_372.txt|His job was not advertised.
p301_373.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301_374.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p301_375.txt|He has changed my life for ever.
p301_376.txt|The home was now under new management.
p301_377.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301_378.txt|There is no openness.
p301_379.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p301_380.txt|It was a job he loved.
p301_381.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p301_382.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301_383.txt|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p301_384.txt|It looks like paradise.
p301_385.txt|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301_386.txt|We were short of athletes.
p301_387.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301_388.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p301_389.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p301_390.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p301_391.txt|I had no qualms about it.
p301_392.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p301_393.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p301_394.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p301_395.txt|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p301_396.txt|It was early morning.
p301_397.txt|Partition is not an option.
p301_398.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p301_399.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301_400.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301_401.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p301_402.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p301_403.txt|There was no cohesion.
p301_404.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p301_405.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p301_406.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p301_407.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p301_408.txt|I saw some good things.
p301_409.txt|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p301_410.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p301_411.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p302_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p302_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302_005.txt|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p302_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p302_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p302_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p302_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p302_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p302_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p302_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p302_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p302_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p302_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p302_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p302_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p302_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p302_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p302_025.txt|It does make a big difference.
p302_026.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p302_027.txt|Each one has its own system.
p302_028.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p302_029.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p302_030.txt|It is a very special city.
p302_031.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p302_032.txt|He's not very big, either.
p302_033.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p302_034.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p302_035.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p302_036.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302_037.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p302_038.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302_039.txt|All of us do.
p302_040.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p302_041.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p302_042.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p302_043.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p302_044.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302_045.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p302_046.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p302_047.txt|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302_048.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p302_049.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p302_050.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p302_051.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p302_052.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p302_053.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p302_054.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302_055.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p302_056.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p302_057.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302_058.txt|We must improve our relations with the government.
p302_059.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p302_060.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p302_061.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p302_062.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p302_063.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302_064.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p302_065.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p302_066.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p302_067.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p302_068.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p302_069.txt|I hope we can put it behind us.
p302_070.txt|But it was to no avail.
p302_071.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302_072.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p302_073.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p302_074.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p302_075.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302_076.txt|You do have a way out.
p302_077.txt|It is simple, really.
p302_078.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p302_079.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p302_080.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p302_081.txt|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p302_082.txt|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p302_083.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302_084.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p302_085.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p302_086.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p302_087.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302_088.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p302_089.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p302_090.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p302_091.txt|He was a crazy man.
p302_092.txt|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p302_093.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302_094.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p302_095.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p302_096.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p302_097.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p302_098.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302_099.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p302_100.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p302_101.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302_102.txt|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302_103.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p302_104.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p302_105.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p302_106.txt|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p302_107.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p302_108.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p302_109.txt|Or so it would appear.
p302_110.txt|I hope they understand that.
p302_111.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p302_112.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p302_114.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302_115.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p302_116.txt|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p302_117.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p302_118.txt|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302_119.txt|It ignores the future.
p302_120.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p302_121.txt|The trial is set for February.
p302_122.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p302_123.txt|Do not go into government buildings.
p302_124.txt|There is only one caveat.
p302_125.txt|We are still getting signals.
p302_126.txt|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302_127.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p302_128.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302_129.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p302_130.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p302_131.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p302_132.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p302_133.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p302_134.txt|It has been in place since last July.
p302_135.txt|The European Court is our only option.
p302_136.txt|Do you think they would be any better?
p302_137.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p302_138.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302_139.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302_140.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p302_141.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p302_142.txt|It will be the final push.
p302_143.txt|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p302_144.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p302_145.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p302_146.txt|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302_147.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p302_148.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302_149.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302_150.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p302_151.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302_152.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p302_153.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p302_154.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p302_155.txt|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p302_156.txt|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p302_157.txt|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p302_158.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302_159.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p302_160.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p302_161.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p302_162.txt|The red card was okay.
p302_163.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p302_164.txt|But they will not be compelled to join.
p302_165.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302_166.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302_167.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p302_168.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p302_169.txt|We must put a marker down.
p302_170.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302_171.txt|There is no date on this document.
p302_172.txt|And now he tells us.
p302_173.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p302_174.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302_175.txt|It is time to come into the limelight.
p302_176.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p302_177.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p302_179.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p302_180.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p302_181.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p302_182.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p302_183.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p302_184.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p302_185.txt|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p302_186.txt|They have two children.
p302_187.txt|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p302_188.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p302_189.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p302_190.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p302_191.txt|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p302_192.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p302_193.txt|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p302_194.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p302_195.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p302_196.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p302_197.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p302_198.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302_199.txt|All the names are familiar to me.
p302_200.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p302_201.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302_202.txt|I've never been limited on drugs.
p302_203.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p302_204.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302_205.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p302_206.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p302_207.txt|Why should we even be asked to share?
p302_208.txt|Which means it matters.
p302_209.txt|There is a great potential on this river.
p302_210.txt|I was surprised by his response.
p302_211.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302_212.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302_213.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p302_214.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p302_215.txt|Is this accurate?
p302_216.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p302_217.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302_218.txt|They could go no further forward.
p302_219.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p302_220.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p302_221.txt|They make it look very easy.
p302_222.txt|It was a total surprise.
p302_223.txt|I had enough on.
p302_224.txt|And we're not there yet.
p302_225.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p302_226.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302_227.txt|plays in dark blue.
p302_228.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p302_229.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p302_230.txt|Survival is our aim.
p302_231.txt|There is no reason at all.
p302_232.txt|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302_233.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p302_234.txt|I'm pleased with the horse.
p302_235.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302_236.txt|This is a club on the rise.
p302_237.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302_238.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302_239.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p302_240.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p302_241.txt|There was no safety net.
p302_242.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p302_243.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p302_244.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302_245.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p302_246.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p302_247.txt|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p302_248.txt|He should be a great asset.
p302_249.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p302_250.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p302_251.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p302_252.txt|We could have got three medals.
p302_253.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302_254.txt|We are at a crossroads.
p302_255.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p302_257.txt|It didn't take long.
p302_258.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p302_259.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302_260.txt|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p302_261.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p302_262.txt|It's not one for the purists.
p302_263.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p302_264.txt|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p302_265.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302_266.txt|It is a time bomb.
p302_267.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302_268.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p302_269.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p302_270.txt|The outstanding issues are still there.
p302_271.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p302_272.txt|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p302_274.txt|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p302_275.txt|That got me out of jail.
p302_276.txt|We have turned the corner.
p302_277.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p302_278.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p302_279.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p302_280.txt|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p302_281.txt|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p302_282.txt|I see no need for change.
p302_283.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p302_284.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p302_285.txt|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302_286.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p302_287.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p302_288.txt|They came into collision with Sergio.
p302_289.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p302_290.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p302_291.txt|He is a success story by any standard.
p302_292.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p302_293.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p302_294.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p302_295.txt|We work on the same level.
p302_296.txt|I've got a young family.
p302_297.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p302_298.txt|It all seemed so easy.
p302_299.txt|I really don't understand what is happening.
p302_300.txt|The frustration was showing.
p302_301.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p302_302.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p302_303.txt|My friends were very envious.
p302_304.txt|The snipers are also out.
p302_305.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p302_306.txt|We are determined to establish the facts.
p302_307.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p302_308.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p302_309.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p302_310.txt|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p302_311.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p302_312.txt|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p302_313.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p302_314.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p302_315.txt|It's like the Russians.
p302_316.txt|Is that Titanic?
p303_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p303_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p303_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p303_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p303_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p303_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p303_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p303_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p303_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p303_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p303_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p303_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p303_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.

p303_025.txt|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303_026.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p303_027.txt|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303_028.txt|That is just a load of baloney.
p303_029.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p303_030.txt|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p303_031.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p303_032.txt|The feeling is marvellous.
p303_033.txt|I think they should have more respect.
p303_034.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303_035.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p303_036.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303_037.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303_038.txt|It was a crucial moment.
p303_039.txt|We gave everything we had.
p303_040.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p303_041.txt|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303_042.txt|His charisma is all on the course.
p303_043.txt|This is purely financial.
p303_044.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p303_045.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p303_046.txt|I did not want any damage to us.
p303_047.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p303_048.txt|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p303_049.txt|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p303_050.txt|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303_051.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p303_052.txt|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p303_053.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p303_054.txt|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p303_055.txt|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303_056.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p303_057.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p303_058.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p303_059.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p303_060.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p303_061.txt|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p303_062.txt|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303_063.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p303_064.txt|Seven children had lost both parents.
p303_065.txt|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303_066.txt|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p303_067.txt|Most people know that.
p303_068.txt|Some people still think she should be English.
p303_069.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303_070.txt|Repayment is not part of the game.
p303_071.txt|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303_072.txt|What do they pay to join the club?
p303_073.txt|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p303_074.txt|We are now in a safe place.
p303_075.txt|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p303_076.txt|It will be very useful for us.
p303_077.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p303_078.txt|We just try to make great records.
p303_079.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p303_080.txt|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p303_081.txt|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p303_082.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p303_083.txt|His parenthood is called into question.
p303_084.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p303_085.txt|We really need research to help with that.
p303_086.txt|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p303_087.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p303_088.txt|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p303_089.txt|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p303_090.txt|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p303_091.txt|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p303_092.txt|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303_093.txt|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303_094.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p303_095.txt|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p303_096.txt|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303_097.txt|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303_098.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p303_099.txt|Their vision was not impeded.
p303_100.txt|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p303_101.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p303_102.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p303_103.txt|He went to see what he could learn.
p303_104.txt|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p303_105.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p303_106.txt|The luxury has been well used.
p303_107.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p303_108.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p303_109.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p303_110.txt|There was no time scale.
p303_111.txt|Only the scale of change differed.
p303_112.txt|Tell you the team he picked?
p303_113.txt|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303_114.txt|The cold war is over.
p303_115.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p303_116.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p303_117.txt|And it's more subversive.
p303_118.txt|We are losing this war.
p303_119.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p303_120.txt|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p303_121.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p303_122.txt|I've got no secret.
p303_123.txt|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303_124.txt|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p303_125.txt|I asked why he had come.
p303_126.txt|Will they ever reopen?
p303_127.txt|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p303_128.txt|A lot of people were in tears.
p303_129.txt|We have great team spirit.
p303_130.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p303_131.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p303_132.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p303_133.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p303_134.txt|We have big ideas.
p303_135.txt|I first met him last summer.
p303_136.txt|It was to be published next month.
p303_137.txt|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303_138.txt|It could have been a hammering by now.
p303_139.txt|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p303_140.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p303_141.txt|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303_142.txt|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303_143.txt|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p303_144.txt|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303_145.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p303_146.txt|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p303_147.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p303_148.txt|All kinds of things occur.
p303_149.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p303_150.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p303_151.txt|It is always the same, isn't it?
p303_152.txt|Who would take it now, after all this?
p303_153.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p303_154.txt|That gives us something to kick against.
p303_155.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303_156.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p303_157.txt|There is precious little middle ground.
p303_158.txt|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p303_159.txt|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303_160.txt|They were both delightful to work with.
p303_161.txt|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303_162.txt|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p303_163.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p303_164.txt|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303_165.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p303_166.txt|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p303_167.txt|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p303_168.txt|Can they be serious?
p303_169.txt|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p303_170.txt|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303_171.txt|It's just that we see different things.
p303_172.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p303_173.txt|We're all family men with children.
p303_174.txt|I think we showed that after half time.
p303_175.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p303_176.txt|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303_177.txt|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303_178.txt|You let a lot of people down.
p303_179.txt|One person was believed to have been hit.
p303_180.txt|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p303_181.txt|We aren't going to play better.
p303_182.txt|They just would not have run away.
p303_183.txt|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303_184.txt|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p303_185.txt|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303_186.txt|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p303_187.txt|Our people should be immune.
p303_188.txt|Glasgow then took control.
p303_189.txt|It is simple and easy to use.
p303_190.txt|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303_191.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303_192.txt|I think we finished fifth.
p303_193.txt|It was not a foul.
p303_194.txt|We know them as mobile telephones.
p303_195.txt|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p303_196.txt|I don't know exactly what happened.
p303_197.txt|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p303_198.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p303_199.txt|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303_200.txt|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p303_201.txt|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p303_202.txt|I am not a happy man.
p303_203.txt|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303_204.txt|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p303_205.txt|I'm going with all three.
p303_206.txt|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303_207.txt|The line-up is a tasty one.
p303_208.txt|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303_209.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p303_210.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p303_211.txt|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p303_212.txt|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303_213.txt|They should also have the right to vote.
p303_214.txt|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303_215.txt|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p303_216.txt|People are so negative about the whole business.
p303_217.txt|They had given up on him.
p303_218.txt|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303_219.txt|It has made me feel good.
p303_220.txt|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p303_221.txt|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p303_222.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p303_223.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303_224.txt|I was living with my mum.
p303_225.txt|It did my image a lot of good!
p303_226.txt|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303_227.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p303_228.txt|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303_229.txt|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303_230.txt|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303_231.txt|I fell in love with ballet.
p303_232.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p303_233.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p303_234.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p303_235.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p303_236.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p303_237.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p303_238.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303_239.txt|I think in three dimensions.
p303_240.txt|They had four children together.
p303_241.txt|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303_242.txt|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p303_243.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p303_244.txt|All were later allowed home.
p303_245.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p303_246.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303_247.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p303_248.txt|It is the end of an era.
p303_249.txt|We can just get on with our game.
p303_250.txt|But first it goes out on TV.
p303_251.txt|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303_252.txt|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303_253.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p303_254.txt|I learned a lot from her.
p303_255.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p303_256.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p303_257.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p303_258.txt|They have a very good method of working.
p303_259.txt|Do you think you have a shot?
p303_260.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p303_261.txt|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303_262.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p303_263.txt|We've had great things in the past.
p303_264.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p303_265.txt|I've seen some of the submissions.
p303_266.txt|There is no such thing.
p303_267.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p303_268.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p303_269.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p303_270.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303_271.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303_272.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303_273.txt|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303_274.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p303_275.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p303_276.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303_277.txt|Last year, however, was a different story.
p303_278.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p303_279.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p303_280.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p303_281.txt|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p303_282.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303_283.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303_284.txt|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p303_285.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303_286.txt|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p303_287.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p303_288.txt|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p303_289.txt|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p303_290.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303_291.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303_292.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p303_293.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p303_294.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p303_295.txt|And that was the adults.
p303_296.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303_297.txt|That is a job for the Government.
p303_298.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p303_299.txt|And he had much need.
p303_300.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303_301.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p303_302.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303_304.txt|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p303_305.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p303_306.txt|Some have other commitments.
p303_307.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p303_308.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303_309.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p303_310.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p303_311.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p303_312.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p303_313.txt|Rapid revision was required.
p303_314.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303_315.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p303_316.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p303_317.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303_318.txt|We have grown up in Britain.
p303_319.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p303_320.txt|I am proud of those guys.
p303_321.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p303_322.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p303_323.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p303_324.txt|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303_325.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p303_326.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p303_327.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p303_328.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p303_329.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p303_330.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303_331.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p303_332.txt|I have a theory.
p303_333.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p303_334.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303_335.txt|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p303_336.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p303_337.txt|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303_338.txt|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303_339.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p303_340.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303_341.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303_342.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p303_343.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p303_344.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p303_345.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p303_346.txt|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303_347.txt|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p303_348.txt|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303_349.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p303_350.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303_351.txt|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303_352.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p303_353.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p305_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p305_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p305_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p305_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p305_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p305_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p305_025.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305_026.txt|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p305_027.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_028.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_029.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305_030.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_031.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_032.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p305_033.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p305_034.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p305_035.txt|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_036.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p305_037.txt|Who has he fought?
p305_038.txt|I want a free vote.
p305_039.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305_040.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_041.txt|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_042.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_043.txt|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_044.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305_045.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p305_046.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047.txt|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p305_048.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p305_049.txt|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050.txt|But don't expect an easy ride.
p305_051.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p305_052.txt|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053.txt|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054.txt|We see little sign of improvement.
p305_055.txt|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305_056.txt|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305_057.txt|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p305_059.txt|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305_060.txt|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061.txt|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062.txt|That tells you something about them.
p305_063.txt|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305_064.txt|This rule is archaic.
p305_065.txt|I am a drug addict.
p305_066.txt|I've had to take time off work today.
p305_067.txt|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068.txt|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069.txt|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305_070.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p305_071.txt|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305_072.txt|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305_073.txt|I've put my own money into this project.
p305_074.txt|I've come here for the jersey.
p305_075.txt|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_076.txt|I'm so proud of my team.
p305_077.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p305_078.txt|This has not, and has been neglected.
p305_079.txt|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080.txt|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305_081.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305_082.txt|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_083.txt|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305_084.txt|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p305_085.txt|The jury is still out.
p305_086.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_087.txt|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p305_088.txt|I drove the ball well.
p305_089.txt|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305_090.txt|His handling raises a wider issue.
p305_091.txt|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_092.txt|He had done his homework properly.
p305_093.txt|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_094.txt|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p305_095.txt|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p305_096.txt|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_097.txt|My grandparents were terrified.
p305_098.txt|Are they control freaks?
p305_099.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_100.txt|They never looked like winning it either.
p305_101.txt|The party lasted all night.
p305_102.txt|No details of the talks were given.
p305_103.txt|It is understood they saw one body.
p305_104.txt|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_105.txt|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305_106.txt|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p305_107.txt|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p305_108.txt|She is a double victim.
p305_109.txt|They make a selective perception process.
p305_110.txt|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_111.txt|It's the way we go about it.
p305_112.txt|There was an e-mail.
p305_113.txt|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_114.txt|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p305_115.txt|Each day is a new beginning.
p305_116.txt|My daughter is an adult.
p305_117.txt|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305_118.txt|We've come from a long way back.
p305_119.txt|A lot of things can go wrong.
p305_120.txt|He seemed to lose his focus.
p305_121.txt|It is a vicious circle.
p305_122.txt|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123.txt|There has been no delay on government orders.
p305_124.txt|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305_125.txt|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p305_126.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p305_127.txt|How do you respond to losing your child?
p305_128.txt|Who is the employer?
p305_129.txt|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p305_130.txt|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131.txt|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305_132.txt|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_133.txt|You can never have enough money.
p305_134.txt|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_135.txt|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305_136.txt|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_137.txt|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_138.txt|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_139.txt|They do the work, you know.
p305_140.txt|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_141.txt|I haven't made the donation yet.
p305_142.txt|Other people also tried.
p305_143.txt|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_144.txt|It would have very little impact on them.
p305_145.txt|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p305_146.txt|My future is in the marathon.
p305_147.txt|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_148.txt|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149.txt|They chose to side with terror.
p305_150.txt|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305_151.txt|They just made me feel dizzy.
p305_152.txt|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p305_153.txt|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305_154.txt|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_155.txt|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_156.txt|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157.txt|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_158.txt|We are asking the council to think again.
p305_159.txt|He had worked there for only two days.
p305_160.txt|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p305_161.txt|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_162.txt|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305_163.txt|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305_164.txt|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_165.txt|We have already begun to do that here.
p305_166.txt|The home team also had their moments.
p305_167.txt|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_168.txt|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305_169.txt|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_170.txt|I got off to a great start.
p305_171.txt|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_172.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p305_173.txt|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p305_174.txt|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p305_175.txt|I got on very well with Allan.
p305_176.txt|That has given me great confidence.
p305_177.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p305_178.txt|He was lying face down in the water.
p305_179.txt|He urged people to forgive.
p305_180.txt|So he is open to ideas.
p305_181.txt|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_182.txt|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p305_183.txt|We are expected to do better than before.
p305_184.txt|The attacker died in the crash.
p305_185.txt|I am not even thinking about that.
p305_186.txt|Angola was a really hard place.
p305_187.txt|It is giving out the wrong message.
p305_188.txt|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305_189.txt|The sleeper was six hours late.
p305_190.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_191.txt|We want to keep the pound.
p305_192.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p305_193.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_194.txt|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p305_195.txt|It just came into my head that day.
p305_196.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_197.txt|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305_198.txt|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_199.txt|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p305_200.txt|He would help me with the form.
p305_201.txt|The actors just have to say so.
p305_202.txt|The minister is the engineer.
p305_203.txt|I think it was briefly considered.
p305_204.txt|It's a hidden problem.
p305_205.txt|I lost a part of me.
p305_206.txt|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p305_207.txt|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305_208.txt|I believe in the Church.
p305_209.txt|Others were even less confident.
p305_210.txt|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_211.txt|So people will come out with these things.
p305_212.txt|You may have a short memory.
p305_213.txt|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_214.txt|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_215.txt|Every game against New Zealand is.
p305_216.txt|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_217.txt|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p305_218.txt|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_219.txt|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_220.txt|It may be his last for a while, too.
p305_221.txt|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_222.txt|Then one night only three people turn up.
p305_223.txt|The parents will have a great time, too.
p305_224.txt|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_225.txt|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_226.txt|Appointments should be made on merit.
p305_227.txt|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_228.txt|I think we will join the single currency.
p305_229.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p305_230.txt|Everything was up for grabs.
p305_231.txt|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p305_232.txt|There will not be any charges.
p305_233.txt|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_234.txt|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_235.txt|I think we have a very strong case.
p305_236.txt|It should be a great game, though.
p305_237.txt|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305_238.txt|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305_239.txt|So the process was refined.
p305_240.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p305_241.txt|I have been here for only three months.
p305_242.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p305_243.txt|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305_244.txt|We hope this scheme will change that.
p305_245.txt|How could anyone take issue with that?
p305_246.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_247.txt|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_248.txt|They had had time for little else.
p305_249.txt|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305_250.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p305_251.txt|She did not attend the courtroom.
p305_252.txt|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p305_253.txt|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_254.txt|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_255.txt|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305_256.txt|But there was a shift.
p305_257.txt|Israel has done very little until now.
p305_258.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_259.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p305_260.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p305_261.txt|We certainly will need to watch him.
p305_262.txt|I don't think it could be clearer.
p305_263.txt|We can only go up.
p305_264.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305_265.txt|Our offer will remain on the table.
p305_266.txt|He is a man who lives to work.
p305_267.txt|The website is now being amended.
p305_268.txt|It's an internal matter.
p305_269.txt|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p305_270.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_271.txt|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_272.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p305_273.txt|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_274.txt|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_275.txt|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_276.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p305_277.txt|They married in August last year.
p305_278.txt|Yet he chose to do something different.
p305_279.txt|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305_280.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p305_281.txt|They really did a great job.
p305_282.txt|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_283.txt|It was worth a photograph.
p305_284.txt|I love you so very much.
p305_285.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p305_286.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p305_287.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_288.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p305_289.txt|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_290.txt|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_291.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_292.txt|Most of the public are behind me.
p305_293.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p305_294.txt|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_295.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p305_296.txt|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_297.txt|This is a very positive step forward.
p305_298.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_299.txt|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305_300.txt|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_301.txt|She is a very lucky lady.
p305_302.txt|We've been there for seven years.
p305_303.txt|They made a huge impression on me.
p305_304.txt|His signature is his handwriting.
p305_305.txt|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_306.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_307.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305_308.txt|It worked, up to a point.
p305_309.txt|One season, they might do well.
p305_310.txt|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305_311.txt|We've got a great defensive club.
p305_312.txt|It's up to their parents to choose.
p305_313.txt|I feel privileged to be here.
p305_314.txt|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_315.txt|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_316.txt|It is still holding good today.
p305_317.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p305_318.txt|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p305_319.txt|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_320.txt|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_321.txt|I know the worry over Iraq.
p305_322.txt|I just could not cope.
p305_323.txt|We didn't know he was even out.
p305_324.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_325.txt|Here are some possible solutions.
p305_326.txt|He made so many bad decisions.
p305_327.txt|We are now up against it.
p305_328.txt|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p305_329.txt|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_330.txt|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p305_331.txt|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_332.txt|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_333.txt|One must hope not!
p305_334.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_335.txt|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p305_336.txt|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p305_337.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p305_338.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305_339.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p305_340.txt|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305_341.txt|I'm just doing artwork.
p305_342.txt|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_343.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_344.txt|So there's a double whammy.
p305_345.txt|I didn't have a trio.
p305_346.txt|Their three other children had died as infants.
p305_347.txt|We knew nothing about it.
p305_348.txt|I am astonished by this decision.
p305_349.txt|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_350.txt|We have got a full house tonight.
p305_351.txt|Our children are our future.
p305_352.txt|We will see how he is.
p305_353.txt|The fans will support us.
p305_354.txt|It was a long process, but we got there.
p305_355.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305_356.txt|The whole team was rubbish.
p305_357.txt|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_358.txt|I put the drawing down.
p305_359.txt|They feel it belongs to them.
p305_360.txt|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_361.txt|They too refused to come out and talk.
p305_362.txt|It gave me something to focus on.
p305_363.txt|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p305_364.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p305_365.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305_366.txt|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p305_367.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p305_368.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305_369.txt|Now there is an even bigger target.
p305_370.txt|There has been a big change in defence.
p305_371.txt|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305_372.txt|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p305_373.txt|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305_374.txt|This must have been severe.
p305_375.txt|We're all in a state of shock.
p305_376.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305_377.txt|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p305_378.txt|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p305_379.txt|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p305_380.txt|He was released in March this year.
p305_381.txt|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p305_382.txt|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p305_383.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p305_384.txt|People might not actually want the job.
p305_385.txt|The court had a number of empty seats.
p305_386.txt|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305_387.txt|It broke up my marriage.
p305_388.txt|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p305_389.txt|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305_390.txt|The package has been properly costed.
p305_391.txt|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305_392.txt|The love affair was over.
p305_393.txt|For some, it was more painful than others.
p305_394.txt|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305_395.txt|I can't stop people thinking.
p305_396.txt|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305_397.txt|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305_398.txt|Several people were out in the street.
p305_399.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p305_400.txt|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305_401.txt|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305_402.txt|The place became a war zone.
p305_403.txt|It is not an abortion.
p305_404.txt|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p305_405.txt|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305_406.txt|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305_407.txt|See it while you can.
p305_408.txt|I didn't do too badly myself.
p305_409.txt|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305_410.txt|He has never even been to Ireland.
p305_411.txt|We believe the squad will stay together.
p305_412.txt|Such people do not exist.
p305_413.txt|We suspect he was pleased.
p305_414.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305_415.txt|She always wanted her own way.
p305_416.txt|But it is all by design.
p305_417.txt|We've still got a say in this.
p305_418.txt|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305_419.txt|I'll take what comes along.
p305_420.txt|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p305_421.txt|Women reported more depression than men.
p305_422.txt|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p306_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p306_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p306_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p306_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p306_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p306_025.txt|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p306_026.txt|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306_027.txt|This is not an amnesty.
p306_028.txt|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p306_029.txt|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p306_030.txt|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306_031.txt|I don't believe you own anything.
p306_032.txt|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306_033.txt|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306_034.txt|Blood samples have been taken.
p306_035.txt|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p306_036.txt|He said he now intends to fly today.
p306_037.txt|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306_038.txt|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p306_039.txt|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306_040.txt|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p306_041.txt|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306_042.txt|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p306_043.txt|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p306_044.txt|We like being the underdogs.
p306_045.txt|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306_046.txt|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p306_047.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p306_048.txt|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306_049.txt|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306_050.txt|Except for this, it was offside.
p306_051.txt|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p306_052.txt|It's a grey area.
p306_053.txt|Retirement, who knows?
p306_054.txt|He was shocked by what he saw.
p306_055.txt|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p306_056.txt|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306_057.txt|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p306_058.txt|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306_059.txt|He was taken ill in December last year.
p306_060.txt|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306_061.txt|It's all too short term.
p306_062.txt|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p306_063.txt|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306_064.txt|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p306_065.txt|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p306_066.txt|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306_067.txt|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306_068.txt|How things have changed since then.
p306_069.txt|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306_070.txt|This is the way things should be handled.
p306_071.txt|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306_072.txt|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p306_073.txt|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p306_074.txt|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p306_075.txt|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306_076.txt|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306_077.txt|You'd think there was a match on today.
p306_078.txt|We must move on.
p306_079.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p306_080.txt|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p306_081.txt|His options are severely limited.
p306_082.txt|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306_083.txt|They are not an item.
p306_084.txt|Why did they let him go?
p306_085.txt|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p306_086.txt|I have made good progress.
p306_087.txt|We do need a new one.
p306_088.txt|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306_089.txt|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p306_090.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306_091.txt|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p306_092.txt|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p306_093.txt|But the relief was short-lived.
p306_094.txt|You had better believe it.
p306_095.txt|The mood is upbeat.
p306_096.txt|They told us about it the next day.
p306_097.txt|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p306_098.txt|There are a huge number of arts.
p306_099.txt|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p306_100.txt|My office is bare.
p306_101.txt|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p306_102.txt|Where is the anthrax?
p306_103.txt|Housing is in very short supply.
p306_104.txt|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p306_105.txt|People just came on their own.
p306_106.txt|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306_107.txt|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306_108.txt|You either have him or you don't.
p306_109.txt|There are some new buildings in there.
p306_110.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p306_111.txt|I'm not a diva.
p306_112.txt|There is great relief at this point.
p306_113.txt|Look at them after three days of rain.
p306_115.txt|There is no point in pushing it.
p306_116.txt|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306_117.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p306_118.txt|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p306_119.txt|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p306_120.txt|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306_121.txt|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306_122.txt|I will speak to Michael about this.
p306_123.txt|This is not understood by people outside.
p306_124.txt|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p306_125.txt|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p306_126.txt|There is a lack of chemistry.
p306_127.txt|I went straight to the toilet.
p306_128.txt|She says the royal family get on well.
p306_129.txt|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p306_130.txt|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p306_131.txt|That group reported just before Christmas.
p306_132.txt|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p306_133.txt|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p306_134.txt|There is still much work to be done.
p306_135.txt|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p306_136.txt|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p306_137.txt|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p306_138.txt|We were with him the whole time.
p306_139.txt|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p306_141.txt|That's because we work hard at it.
p306_142.txt|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p306_143.txt|He's been the key to everything.
p306_144.txt|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p306_145.txt|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p306_146.txt|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p306_147.txt|We need a new kind of theatre.
p306_148.txt|I was in the train station overnight.
p306_149.txt|I feel my life to be at risk.
p306_150.txt|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p306_151.txt|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p306_152.txt|We came across the first set of bodies.
p306_153.txt|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306_154.txt|Does that put pressure on us?
p306_155.txt|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306_156.txt|This is a foolish idea.
p306_157.txt|You might even have seen him.
p306_158.txt|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306_159.txt|They thought they had found a home.
p306_160.txt|She collapsed and died a day later.
p306_161.txt|You should be there with six different characters.
p306_162.txt|Laura is an investment banker.
p306_163.txt|I took a minibus into town.
p306_164.txt|I do my job.
p306_165.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p306_166.txt|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p306_167.txt|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306_168.txt|Four policemen were wounded.
p306_169.txt|Who do these people think they are?
p306_171.txt|We want to help them through it.
p306_172.txt|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p306_173.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p306_174.txt|It was a bit like having children.
p306_175.txt|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p306_176.txt|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p306_177.txt|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306_178.txt|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306_179.txt|I came home by ambulance.
p306_180.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p306_181.txt|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306_182.txt|She is living proof of their expertise.
p306_183.txt|This one was my best chance.
p306_184.txt|We believe a third party was involved.
p306_185.txt|I am writing a novel.
p306_186.txt|A bit of match fitness is required.
p306_187.txt|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p306_188.txt|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306_189.txt|It was located on the remote control.
p306_190.txt|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p306_191.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p306_192.txt|These elements are in the book.
p306_193.txt|You look at them and you understand.
p306_194.txt|I am considered a teenager.
p306_195.txt|I would like Glasgow.
p306_196.txt|The FBI could become involved.
p306_197.txt|We have only nine months to go.
p306_198.txt|Both of them have looked good.
p306_199.txt|I like footballers who play well.
p306_201.txt|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306_202.txt|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p306_203.txt|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p306_204.txt|Donald was a man with many friends.
p306_205.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p306_206.txt|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p306_207.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p306_208.txt|We were on top and could have won.
p306_209.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p306_210.txt|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306_211.txt|He ended up a headmaster.
p306_212.txt|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p306_213.txt|It is like being a qualifier again.
p306_214.txt|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p306_215.txt|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306_216.txt|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p306_217.txt|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p306_218.txt|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p306_219.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p306_220.txt|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p306_221.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p306_222.txt|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306_223.txt|She didn't tell us anything new.
p306_224.txt|There is nothing like this back home.
p306_225.txt|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p306_226.txt|I found a fault and worked at it.
p306_227.txt|It was a poor performance.
p306_228.txt|They may yet have the last laugh.
p306_229.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p306_230.txt|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306_231.txt|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306_232.txt|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p306_233.txt|He will become the sovereign.
p306_234.txt|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p306_236.txt|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p306_237.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p306_238.txt|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p306_239.txt|It's just gotten too big.
p306_240.txt|Was all this really just five months ago?
p306_241.txt|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p306_242.txt|They were two different types.
p306_243.txt|It need not be like that.
p306_244.txt|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p306_245.txt|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p306_246.txt|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306_247.txt|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p306_248.txt|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p306_249.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p306_250.txt|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p306_251.txt|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p306_252.txt|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p306_253.txt|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p306_254.txt|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306_255.txt|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p306_256.txt|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p306_257.txt|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p306_258.txt|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p306_259.txt|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306_260.txt|He must have something up his sleeve.
p306_261.txt|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p306_262.txt|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p306_263.txt|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p306_264.txt|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p306_265.txt|Holland won by five wickets.
p306_266.txt|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p306_267.txt|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p306_268.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p306_269.txt|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p306_270.txt|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p306_272.txt|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p306_273.txt|The board has rejected her proposals.
p306_274.txt|It does not move, which is amazing.
p306_275.txt|She is a very lucky young lady.
p306_276.txt|The threat to rural areas is real.
p306_277.txt|Tourism continues to struggle.
p306_278.txt|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306_279.txt|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306_281.txt|This is a great shame.
p306_282.txt|That was merely their initial problem.
p306_283.txt|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p306_284.txt|We said, What do you mean?
p306_285.txt|I need them to set my career.
p306_286.txt|The law will take its course.
p306_287.txt|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p306_288.txt|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p306_289.txt|The fund has three elements.
p306_290.txt|This is a young team, you know.
p306_291.txt|It's not even finished.
p306_292.txt|Everyone knew where they were.
p306_293.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306_294.txt|In the old days, it was easy.
p306_295.txt|People will make up their own minds.
p306_296.txt|After that he became more romantic.
p306_297.txt|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306_298.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p306_299.txt|They finished second and third.
p306_300.txt|We agreed to disagree.
p306_301.txt|He was then replaced by Ross.
p306_302.txt|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p306_303.txt|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306_304.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306_305.txt|People can get them if they want.
p306_306.txt|Their message was simple.
p306_307.txt|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306_308.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p306_309.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p306_310.txt|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306_311.txt|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306_312.txt|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p306_313.txt|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p306_314.txt|It was just completely erased.
p306_315.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p306_316.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p306_317.txt|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p306_318.txt|Too often it is not.
p306_319.txt|I tend to not look back.
p306_320.txt|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306_321.txt|I got a yellow card.
p306_322.txt|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p306_323.txt|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p306_324.txt|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306_325.txt|It's good to start with Judith.
p306_326.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p306_327.txt|It may also be her last.
p306_328.txt|Maybe it helps us.
p306_329.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p306_330.txt|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306_331.txt|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306_332.txt|He made no big mistakes.
p306_333.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p306_334.txt|We will be homeless.
p306_335.txt|I believe he can do a better job.
p306_336.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p306_337.txt|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306_338.txt|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p306_339.txt|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306_340.txt|Well, was it?
p306_341.txt|We won't let you down.
p306_342.txt|What kind of person is he?
p306_343.txt|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p306_344.txt|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p306_345.txt|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p306_346.txt|English is the language of pop music.
p306_347.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306_348.txt|It is a simple equation.
p306_349.txt|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p306_351.txt|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_352.txt|Who has the second highest?
p306_354.txt|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p306_355.txt|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306_356.txt|No person was charged.
p306_357.txt|I've only met him three times.
p306_358.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p306_359.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p306_360.txt|She looked very, very poor.
p307_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p307_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p307_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p307_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p307_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p307_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p307_025.txt|But it was a great decision he joked.
p307_026.txt|They changed the world of music.
p307_027.txt|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p307_028.txt|The law has got to be upheld.
p307_029.txt|But we're not the same person.
p307_030.txt|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p307_031.txt|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307_032.txt|The punishment was swift.
p307_033.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307_034.txt|I kept my side of the bargain.
p307_035.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p307_036.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p307_037.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p307_038.txt|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307_039.txt|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307_040.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307_041.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p307_042.txt|I have played really well all year.
p307_043.txt|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307_044.txt|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307_045.txt|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p307_046.txt|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p307_047.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p307_048.txt|I try not to expect anything.
p307_049.txt|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307_050.txt|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307_051.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307_052.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p307_053.txt|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307_054.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307_055.txt|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p307_056.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p307_057.txt|I keep my fingers crossed.
p307_058.txt|The encounter was to change his life.
p307_059.txt|It's the best of both worlds.
p307_060.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307_061.txt|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307_062.txt|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p307_063.txt|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307_064.txt|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p307_065.txt|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307_066.txt|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p307_067.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p307_068.txt|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p307_069.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p307_070.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p307_071.txt|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p307_072.txt|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p307_073.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307_074.txt|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307_075.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307_076.txt|This is a mental challenge.
p307_077.txt|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307_078.txt|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p307_079.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307_080.txt|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p307_081.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p307_082.txt|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307_083.txt|Cars are great for going long distances.
p307_084.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307_085.txt|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307_086.txt|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p307_087.txt|It has never been worthwhile.
p307_088.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p307_089.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307_090.txt|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307_091.txt|People love to see this stuff.
p307_092.txt|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p307_093.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307_094.txt|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p307_095.txt|I have no plans to change the oath.
p307_096.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p307_097.txt|He was married with a young child.
p307_098.txt|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p307_099.txt|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307_100.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p307_101.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307_102.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p307_103.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p307_104.txt|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p307_105.txt|Is your life a little too easy?
p307_106.txt|I think my game is suited to grass.
p307_107.txt|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307_108.txt|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307_109.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307_110.txt|People want to see me on the screen.
p307_111.txt|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p307_112.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p307_113.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p307_114.txt|He took away my childhood.
p307_115.txt|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307_116.txt|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p307_117.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307_118.txt|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307_119.txt|It is not great art.
p307_120.txt|You do not change overnight.
p307_121.txt|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p307_122.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p307_123.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p307_124.txt|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307_125.txt|We aim to put them out of business.
p307_126.txt|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307_127.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p307_128.txt|He was just awesome.
p307_129.txt|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307_130.txt|We need to move forward together.
p307_131.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p307_132.txt|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307_133.txt|Both were later released after a check-up.
p307_134.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p307_135.txt|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p307_136.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p307_137.txt|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307_138.txt|The son has autism and other problems.
p307_139.txt|I'm very puzzled by it.
p307_140.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307_141.txt|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307_142.txt|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307_143.txt|All things are possible if you believe.
p307_144.txt|This was not just incongruous.
p307_145.txt|It is patently true.
p307_146.txt|You hope he prevails.
p307_147.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_148.txt|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p307_149.txt|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p307_150.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p307_151.txt|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p307_152.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307_153.txt|He was forced to quit.
p307_154.txt|It is good for their eyesight.
p307_155.txt|I was loving that little girl.
p307_156.txt|But you can't have it both ways.
p307_157.txt|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p307_158.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p307_159.txt|The death toll included five children.
p307_160.txt|Before the game we went for a pint.
p307_161.txt|There is no credible official announcement.
p307_162.txt|I understand the medical concerns.
p307_163.txt|This is a United Kingdom.
p307_164.txt|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p307_165.txt|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307_166.txt|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307_167.txt|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307_168.txt|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p307_169.txt|They were behind the wheel.
p307_170.txt|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307_171.txt|The problem arises because he does so much.
p307_172.txt|The answer is mayhem.
p307_173.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p307_174.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p307_175.txt|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307_176.txt|That will be the sweetness.
p307_177.txt|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307_178.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p307_179.txt|There was a fossil on screen.
p307_180.txt|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p307_181.txt|This does not create any precedent.
p307_182.txt|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p307_183.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p307_184.txt|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p307_185.txt|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p307_186.txt|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307_187.txt|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p307_188.txt|I hope you miss the cut.
p307_189.txt|The role was perfect for Russell.
p307_190.txt|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p307_191.txt|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p307_192.txt|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307_193.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p307_194.txt|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p307_195.txt|Harold is a rarity.
p307_196.txt|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307_197.txt|I want him to take on Gomez.
p307_198.txt|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307_199.txt|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p307_200.txt|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p307_201.txt|Well, what do you know?
p307_202.txt|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p307_203.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p307_204.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p307_205.txt|He will emerge as a world leader.
p307_206.txt|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p307_207.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p307_208.txt|We have no choice but to shut down.
p307_209.txt|The prognosis is excellent.
p307_210.txt|They always want to give a performance.
p307_211.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p307_212.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p307_213.txt|I would not want to be young again.
p307_214.txt|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p307_215.txt|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p307_216.txt|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p307_217.txt|They were later discharged from hospital.
p307_218.txt|These findings would be made public.
p307_219.txt|What are you not good at?
p307_220.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p307_221.txt|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307_222.txt|This makes no sense!
p307_223.txt|I go home only once.
p307_224.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p307_225.txt|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p307_226.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p307_227.txt|The team this year is going places.
p307_228.txt|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307_229.txt|It took more than two years.
p307_230.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p307_231.txt|He said because people had invited him.
p307_232.txt|That's the key issue isn't it?
p307_233.txt|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307_234.txt|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p307_235.txt|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p307_236.txt|I came up through the ranks.
p307_237.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p307_238.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p307_239.txt|These guys will not lie down.
p307_240.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p307_241.txt|That is nearly four people every day.
p307_242.txt|There are nine people here now.
p307_243.txt|His son is a local legend.
p307_244.txt|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p307_245.txt|Which perhaps is just as well.
p307_246.txt|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p307_247.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p307_248.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p307_249.txt|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p307_250.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p307_251.txt|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p307_252.txt|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p307_253.txt|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p307_254.txt|The final stage is paranoia.
p307_255.txt|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p307_256.txt|Wanger was never like this.
p307_257.txt|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p307_258.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p307_259.txt|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p307_260.txt|That's the sort of game you want.
p307_261.txt|We're not travel agents.
p307_262.txt|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p307_263.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p307_264.txt|It's the same old story.
p307_265.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p307_266.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p307_267.txt|I do not own the vessel in question.
p307_268.txt|Racism has no place in any sport.
p307_269.txt|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p307_270.txt|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p307_271.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p307_272.txt|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p307_273.txt|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p307_274.txt|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p307_275.txt|I'd say we should give it a week.
p307_276.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p307_277.txt|Little Voice is on general release.
p307_278.txt|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p307_279.txt|There is no substitute.
p307_280.txt|That nation is South Africa.
p307_281.txt|This will secure the future of our industry.
p307_282.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p307_283.txt|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p307_284.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p307_285.txt|It was an empowering journey.
p307_286.txt|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p307_287.txt|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p307_288.txt|They had been together for about three years.
p307_289.txt|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p307_290.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p307_291.txt|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307_292.txt|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p307_293.txt|We just want to get stuck in now.
p307_294.txt|Do you come from Moscow?
p307_295.txt|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p307_296.txt|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p307_297.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p307_298.txt|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p307_299.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p307_300.txt|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p307_301.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p307_302.txt|Broke the birdie record.
p307_303.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p307_304.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p307_305.txt|That it is a brand name.
p307_306.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p307_307.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p307_308.txt|They will have to make changes.
p307_309.txt|This fact is supported by audience research.
p307_310.txt|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p307_311.txt|Both sides have to step back.
p307_312.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p307_313.txt|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p307_314.txt|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p307_315.txt|We are ready for the long haul.
p307_316.txt|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p307_317.txt|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p307_318.txt|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p307_319.txt|EMI is a prime example.
p307_320.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p307_321.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p307_322.txt|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p307_323.txt|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307_324.txt|A friendship that will endure.
p307_325.txt|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307_326.txt|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p307_327.txt|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p307_328.txt|He is young but not too young.
p307_329.txt|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p307_330.txt|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p307_331.txt|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p307_332.txt|I am not obsessed with sex.
p307_333.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p307_334.txt|There is no answer to it.
p307_335.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p307_336.txt|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p307_337.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p307_338.txt|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p307_339.txt|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p307_340.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p307_341.txt|I am not putting myself down.
p307_342.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p307_343.txt|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p307_344.txt|We were lucky to have survived.
p307_345.txt|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307_346.txt|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p307_347.txt|I just want to change my life.
p307_348.txt|He did not oppose the divorce.
p307_349.txt|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p307_350.txt|And Michael was just great.
p307_351.txt|He knew it would cost him millions.
p307_352.txt|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307_353.txt|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p307_354.txt|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p307_355.txt|That only came out during a radio interview.
p307_356.txt|We are now setting about finding them.
p307_357.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p307_358.txt|We must not go down that road.
p307_359.txt|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p307_360.txt|I am not among its admirers.
p307_361.txt|And that match was played in June.
p307_362.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p307_363.txt|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p307_364.txt|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p307_365.txt|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p307_366.txt|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307_367.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p307_368.txt|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p307_369.txt|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p307_370.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p307_371.txt|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p307_372.txt|His job was not advertised.
p307_373.txt|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307_374.txt|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p307_375.txt|He has changed my life for ever.
p307_376.txt|The home was now under new management.
p307_377.txt|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307_378.txt|There is no openness.
p307_379.txt|It's being very carefully looked at.
p307_380.txt|It was a job he loved.
p307_381.txt|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p307_382.txt|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307_383.txt|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p307_384.txt|It looks like paradise.
p307_386.txt|We were short of athletes.
p307_387.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307_388.txt|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p307_389.txt|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p307_390.txt|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p307_391.txt|I had no qualms about it.
p307_392.txt|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p307_393.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p307_394.txt|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p307_395.txt|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p307_396.txt|It was early morning.
p307_397.txt|Partition is not an option.
p307_398.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p307_399.txt|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p307_400.txt|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307_401.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p307_402.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p307_403.txt|There was no cohesion.
p307_404.txt|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p307_405.txt|Whether this return was too soon.
p307_406.txt|Jackson may well be right.
p307_407.txt|My thoughts are with their families.
p307_408.txt|I saw some good things.
p307_410.txt|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p307_411.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p307_412.txt|But who gets on the tube?
p307_413.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p307_414.txt|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307_416.txt|So now this series has had its day.
p307_417.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307_418.txt|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p307_419.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p307_420.txt|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p307_421.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p307_422.txt|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p307_423.txt|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p307_424.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p308_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p308_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p308_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p308_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308_008.txt|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p308_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p308_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p308_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p308_025.txt|It does make a big difference.
p308_026.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308_027.txt|Each one has its own system.
p308_028.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p308_029.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p308_030.txt|It is a very special city.
p308_031.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308_032.txt|He is not very big, either.
p308_033.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p308_034.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p308_035.txt|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308_036.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308_037.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p308_038.txt|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p308_039.txt|All of us do.
p308_040.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p308_041.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p308_042.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p308_043.txt|Theatre is not a museum.
p308_044.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p308_045.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308_046.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p308_047.txt|They don't take you to mass graves.
p308_048.txt|What's it got to do with art?
p308_049.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p308_050.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p308_051.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p308_052.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p308_053.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p308_054.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308_055.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p308_056.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p308_057.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308_058.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p308_059.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p308_060.txt|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p308_061.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p308_062.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308_063.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p308_064.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p308_065.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p308_066.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p308_067.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308_068.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p308_069.txt|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308_070.txt|But it was to no avail.
p308_071.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308_072.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p308_073.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p308_074.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308_075.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p308_076.txt|You do have a way out.
p308_077.txt|It is simple, really.
p308_078.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308_079.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p308_080.txt|You, the British people, are the boss.
p308_081.txt|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p308_082.txt|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p308_083.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p308_084.txt|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p308_085.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p308_086.txt|She could easily have been killed.
p308_087.txt|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p308_088.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308_089.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308_090.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p308_091.txt|He was a crazy man.
p308_092.txt|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p308_093.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p308_094.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308_095.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p308_096.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308_097.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p308_098.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308_099.txt|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p308_100.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308_101.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308_102.txt|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308_103.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p308_104.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308_105.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p308_106.txt|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308_107.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p308_108.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p308_109.txt|Or so it would appear.
p308_110.txt|I hope they understand that.
p308_111.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308_112.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p308_113.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p308_114.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p308_115.txt|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p308_116.txt|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p308_117.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p308_118.txt|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p308_119.txt|It ignores the future.
p308_120.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p308_121.txt|The trial is set for February.
p308_122.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p308_123.txt|Do not go into government buildings.
p308_124.txt|There is only one caveat.
p308_125.txt|We are still getting signals.
p308_126.txt|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p308_127.txt|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p308_128.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p308_129.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p308_130.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p308_131.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p308_132.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p308_133.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p308_134.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p308_135.txt|The European Court is our only option.
p308_136.txt|Do you think they would do any better?
p308_137.txt|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p308_138.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p308_139.txt|The singer's condition was not specified.
p308_140.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p308_141.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p308_142.txt|It will be the final push.
p308_143.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308_144.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p308_145.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p308_146.txt|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p308_147.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p308_148.txt|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p308_149.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p308_150.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p308_151.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p308_152.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p308_153.txt|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308_154.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p308_155.txt|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p308_156.txt|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p308_157.txt|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308_158.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p308_159.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308_160.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308_161.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308_162.txt|The red card was okay.
p308_163.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308_164.txt|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308_165.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308_166.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p308_167.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308_168.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p308_169.txt|We must put a marker down.
p308_170.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308_171.txt|There is no date on this document.
p308_172.txt|And now he tells us.
p308_173.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308_174.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p308_175.txt|It is time to come into the limelight.
p308_176.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p308_177.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p308_178.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308_179.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p308_180.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308_181.txt|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308_182.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308_183.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p308_184.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p308_185.txt|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308_186.txt|They've two children.
p308_187.txt|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308_188.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p308_189.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p308_190.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p308_191.txt|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308_192.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p308_193.txt|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308_194.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p308_195.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308_196.txt|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p308_197.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p308_198.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p308_199.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p308_200.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p308_201.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p308_202.txt|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308_203.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p308_204.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p308_205.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p308_206.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308_207.txt|Why should we even be asked to share?
p308_208.txt|Which means it matters.
p308_209.txt|There is great potential on this river.
p308_210.txt|I was surprised by his response.
p308_211.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p308_212.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p308_213.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p308_214.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308_215.txt|Is this accurate?
p308_216.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308_217.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p308_218.txt|They could go no further forward.
p308_219.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p308_220.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p308_221.txt|They make it look very easy.
p308_222.txt|It was a total surprise.
p308_223.txt|I had enough on.
p308_224.txt|And we're not there yet.
p308_225.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p308_226.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p308_227.txt|plays in dark blue.
p308_228.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308_229.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p308_230.txt|Survival is our aim.
p308_231.txt|There is no reason at all.
p308_232.txt|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p308_233.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308_234.txt|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308_235.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p308_236.txt|There is a club on the rise.
p308_237.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p308_238.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p308_239.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p308_240.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p308_241.txt|There was no safety net.
p308_242.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308_243.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p308_244.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p308_245.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p308_246.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308_247.txt|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p308_248.txt|He should be a great asset.
p308_249.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p308_250.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308_251.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308_252.txt|We could have got three medals.
p308_253.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p308_254.txt|We are at a crossroads.
p308_255.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p308_256.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p308_257.txt|It didn't take long.
p308_258.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308_259.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p308_260.txt|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308_261.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p308_262.txt|It's not one for the purists.
p308_263.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p308_264.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p308_265.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p308_266.txt|It is a time bomb.
p308_267.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p308_268.txt|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p308_269.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308_270.txt|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308_271.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308_272.txt|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p308_273.txt|And that's good news for the magpies.
p308_274.txt|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p308_275.txt|That got me out of jail.
p308_276.txt|We've turned the corner.
p308_277.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p308_278.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308_279.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p308_280.txt|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308_281.txt|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308_282.txt|I see no need for change.
p308_283.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p308_284.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308_285.txt|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p308_286.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p308_287.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p308_288.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p308_289.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308_290.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308_291.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p308_292.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p308_293.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p308_294.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p308_295.txt|We work on the same level.
p308_296.txt|I've got a young family.
p308_297.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p308_298.txt|It all seemed so easy.
p308_299.txt|I really don't understand what is happening.
p308_300.txt|The frustration was showing.
p308_301.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308_302.txt|I am a wealthy person.
p308_303.txt|My friends were very envious.
p308_304.txt|The snipers are also out.
p308_305.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p308_306.txt|We're determined to establish the facts.
p308_307.txt|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308_308.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p308_309.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p308_310.txt|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308_311.txt|It plans to return to this field.
p308_312.txt|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p308_313.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p308_314.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308_315.txt|It's like the Russians.
p308_316.txt|Is that Titanic?
p308_317.txt|Let us hope so.
p308_318.txt|So, the question is, is it any good?
p308_319.txt|I'm getting back up there now.
p308_320.txt|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308_321.txt|My players have no idea about football.
p308_322.txt|They are there to get people into work.
p308_323.txt|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p308_324.txt|They would be wise to do just that.
p308_325.txt|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308_326.txt|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308_327.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p308_328.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p308_329.txt|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p308_330.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p308_331.txt|I'd go to bookshops.
p308_332.txt|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308_333.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p308_334.txt|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308_335.txt|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308_336.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p308_337.txt|There was no hint of bravado.
p308_338.txt|You've been a great audience.
p308_339.txt|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308_340.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p308_341.txt|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308_342.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p308_343.txt|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308_344.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p308_345.txt|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p308_346.txt|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p308_347.txt|The princess has had other health problems.
p308_348.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p308_349.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p308_350.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p308_351.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p308_352.txt|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p308_353.txt|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308_354.txt|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308_355.txt|It was a UK-wide report.
p308_356.txt|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p308_357.txt|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p308_358.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308_359.txt|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308_360.txt|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308_361.txt|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p308_362.txt|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p308_363.txt|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p308_364.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p308_365.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p308_366.txt|I grew up listening to these people.
p308_367.txt|It is normal for me.
p308_368.txt|But it may not be all bad news.
p308_369.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p308_370.txt|I am content with the silver.
p308_371.txt|We have fun in our lives.
p308_372.txt|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308_373.txt|You have to audition for jobs.
p308_374.txt|We're not comparing like with like.
p308_375.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p308_376.txt|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308_377.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p308_378.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p308_379.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p308_380.txt|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p308_381.txt|That is not just my personal view.
p308_382.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p308_383.txt|It's like a garage.
p308_384.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308_385.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p308_386.txt|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308_387.txt|You just have to accept.
p308_388.txt|We've got to get it right.
p308_389.txt|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308_390.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p308_391.txt|Would you take them?
p308_392.txt|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308_393.txt|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p308_394.txt|His condition was stable last night.
p308_395.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p308_396.txt|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p308_397.txt|The report is due out next month.
p308_398.txt|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p308_399.txt|It remains in public ownership.
p308_400.txt|The Master was by then just too old.
p308_401.txt|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p308_402.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p308_403.txt|It's a very high number.
p308_404.txt|I leave tonight for England.
p308_405.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308_406.txt|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p308_407.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p308_408.txt|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308_409.txt|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308_410.txt|There are simply no orders.
p308_411.txt|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308_412.txt|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p308_413.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p308_414.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p308_415.txt|She took them for a term.
p308_416.txt|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p308_417.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308_418.txt|Or so she thought.
p308_419.txt|It was another good idea.
p308_420.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p308_421.txt|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308_422.txt|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308_423.txt|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p310_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p310_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p310_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p310_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p310_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p310_025.txt|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_026.txt|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_027.txt|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p310_028.txt|It feels like a winner already.
p310_029.txt|Did you see that?
p310_030.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310_031.txt|And the winners are.
p310_032.txt|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p310_034.txt|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p310_035.txt|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_036.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p310_037.txt|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_038.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p310_039.txt|But one shouldn't go by that.
p310_040.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p310_041.txt|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_042.txt|There are big names.
p310_043.txt|That argument has been won.
p310_044.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p310_045.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p310_046.txt|And who would argue with that?
p310_047.txt|I hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049.txt|They had four children together.
p310_050.txt|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310_051.txt|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052.txt|I fell to the ground.
p310_053.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p310_054.txt|They were not defeated.
p310_055.txt|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p310_056.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p310_057.txt|All of us know it exists.
p310_058.txt|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059.txt|This is the band.
p310_060.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p310_061.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p310_063.txt|It is the end of an era.
p310_064.txt|We shall not do that.
p310_065.txt|I have had no social life at all.
p310_066.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067.txt|Once again, he refused.
p310_068.txt|This is about the Orange Order.
p310_069.txt|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p310_070.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p310_071.txt|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p310_072.txt|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p310_073.txt|The Commons is too outdated.
p310_074.txt|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p310_075.txt|That was then and this is now.
p310_076.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310_077.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078.txt|Are you watching Liverpool?
p310_079.txt|He would be with his peers.
p310_080.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081.txt|But it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082.txt|They don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083.txt|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p310_084.txt|I am so sorry.
p310_085.txt|This avalanche is just beginning.
p310_086.txt|Journalists should make him.
p310_087.txt|I believe we have a good chance.
p310_088.txt|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310_089.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p310_090.txt|This is the best moment of my career.
p310_091.txt|He also called in at another farm.
p310_092.txt|I don't know why she is not here.
p310_093.txt|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p310_094.txt|I agree with them.
p310_095.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p310_096.txt|Now he will have to start again.
p310_097.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_098.txt|I don't know how it happened.
p310_099.txt|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_100.txt|After that nothing could save him.
p310_101.txt|Construction is due to begin in February.
p310_102.txt|We shall rely on human beings.
p310_103.txt|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310_104.txt|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_105.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_106.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_107.txt|Or, rather, it isn't.
p310_108.txt|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310_109.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_110.txt|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310_111.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310_112.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_113.txt|But there is another side.
p310_114.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_115.txt|There is no guarantee.
p310_116.txt|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_117.txt|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p310_118.txt|It may be argued.
p310_119.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310_120.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p310_121.txt|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p310_122.txt|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310_123.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_124.txt|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_125.txt|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310_126.txt|This is just one example.
p310_127.txt|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_128.txt|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p310_129.txt|We stopped at half-time.
p310_130.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p310_131.txt|David was not either.
p310_132.txt|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_133.txt|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_134.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_135.txt|No date has been set for the appeal.
p310_136.txt|He is dying from cancer.
p310_137.txt|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_138.txt|What's the rush?
p310_139.txt|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_140.txt|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p310_141.txt|They receive a high profile in the media.
p310_142.txt|It was an ambush.
p310_143.txt|I think this proposal is excellent.
p310_144.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p310_145.txt|Is that too much to ask?
p310_146.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_147.txt|I've so much respect for him.
p310_148.txt|Each one has its own system.
p310_149.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p310_150.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_151.txt|And that was the adults.
p310_152.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310_153.txt|This is a job for the Government.
p310_154.txt|I felt the head was very like me.
p310_155.txt|We started with that.
p310_156.txt|And he had much need.
p310_157.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_158.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p310_159.txt|It's never the same problem.
p310_160.txt|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p310_161.txt|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310_162.txt|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_163.txt|I was over the moon.
p310_164.txt|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p310_165.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p310_166.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310_167.txt|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_168.txt|And then came the seventies.
p310_169.txt|I guess it is down to focus.
p310_170.txt|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310_171.txt|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p310_172.txt|His track record is not promising.
p310_173.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p310_174.txt|He put a lot of effort into it.
p310_175.txt|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310_176.txt|That was moving the goalposts.
p310_177.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_178.txt|We have the location, which is assured.
p310_179.txt|The club are feeling no different today.
p310_180.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p310_181.txt|I see the extended family once a year.
p310_182.txt|I'm not a magician.
p310_183.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p310_185.txt|There was even a joke.
p310_186.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p310_187.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p310_188.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310_189.txt|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p310_190.txt|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_191.txt|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_192.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p310_193.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p310_194.txt|I just had so much fun.
p310_195.txt|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p310_196.txt|I will wait until later.
p310_197.txt|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_198.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p310_199.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p310_200.txt|They responded with victories.
p310_201.txt|That was the personal impulse.
p310_202.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p310_203.txt|But first it goes out on TV.
p310_204.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p310_205.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p310_206.txt|I think it's awful.
p310_207.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p310_208.txt|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_209.txt|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310_210.txt|One must hope not!
p310_211.txt|He is a Satan.
p310_212.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_213.txt|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310_214.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p310_215.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310_216.txt|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p310_217.txt|There was no cohesion.
p310_218.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p310_219.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p310_220.txt|We will not break even.
p310_221.txt|We will look into it.
p310_222.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p310_223.txt|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_224.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p310_225.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310_226.txt|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310_227.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_228.txt|Things are moving together.
p310_229.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p310_230.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_231.txt|He must not be removed from office.
p310_232.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p310_233.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p310_234.txt|Look at the table.
p310_235.txt|This film will be totally awesome.
p310_236.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310_237.txt|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_238.txt|Last year was not a good year.
p310_239.txt|It's a difficult job.
p310_240.txt|We can't get over it.
p310_241.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_242.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_243.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p310_244.txt|He saw it all as a big game.
p310_245.txt|They are not an item.
p310_246.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p310_247.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_248.txt|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_249.txt|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_250.txt|I would urge the Government to think again.
p310_251.txt|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_252.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310_253.txt|I was happiest with my short game.
p310_254.txt|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p310_255.txt|We went on to become very successful.
p310_256.txt|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310_257.txt|No, is the answer to your first question.
p310_258.txt|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p310_259.txt|That could be at least five years away.
p310_260.txt|That is my role.
p310_261.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p310_262.txt|That's the day job.
p310_263.txt|It really is taken seriously.
p310_264.txt|We have not given up hope.
p310_265.txt|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_266.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_267.txt|It's such a trial!
p310_268.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_269.txt|I think it is totally wrong.
p310_270.txt|And a film maker was born.
p310_271.txt|It was also put on the Internet.
p310_272.txt|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310_273.txt|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_274.txt|It seems to have worked.
p310_275.txt|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_276.txt|There was a battle there.
p310_277.txt|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p310_278.txt|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p310_279.txt|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_280.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p310_281.txt|THE atmosphere was electric.
p310_282.txt|I'd never heard him in person before.
p310_283.txt|We're going to change our party.
p310_284.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_285.txt|I have learned a lot from him.
p310_286.txt|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_287.txt|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_288.txt|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_289.txt|He must have something up his sleeve.
p310_290.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p310_291.txt|We make good weapons.
p310_292.txt|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p310_293.txt|This is not a Scottish problem.
p310_294.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p310_295.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310_296.txt|That was the most annoying thing.
p310_297.txt|We are being hijacked.
p310_298.txt|We had no part in it.
p310_299.txt|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310_300.txt|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310_301.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_302.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p310_303.txt|And there is no cause for it.
p310_304.txt|That would have been too easy.
p310_305.txt|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_306.txt|This is not a faceless system.
p310_307.txt|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310_308.txt|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_309.txt|It is just like the stock market.
p310_310.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p310_311.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p310_312.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_313.txt|What, then, is the real thing?
p310_314.txt|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_315.txt|Most people know that.
p310_316.txt|It will be the final push.
p310_317.txt|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310_318.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p310_319.txt|The campaign was raucous.
p310_320.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p310_321.txt|But both were involved with other matters.
p310_322.txt|But we were wrong.
p310_323.txt|The result today is an impasse.
p310_324.txt|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p310_325.txt|There is no threat to them.
p310_326.txt|Nelson does not disappoint.
p310_327.txt|The goal will stay with me forever.
p310_328.txt|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310_329.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_330.txt|It is a high time to act.
p310_331.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310_332.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p310_333.txt|The South African defended his work ethic.
p310_334.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p310_335.txt|There was barely a handful of chances.
p310_336.txt|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_337.txt|I have found my vision.
p310_338.txt|We don't know the scale of need.
p310_339.txt|You need a reason for staying.
p310_340.txt|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p310_341.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p310_342.txt|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_343.txt|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p310_344.txt|The big issue for us is the review.
p310_345.txt|That is not the way we should operate.
p310_346.txt|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310_347.txt|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_348.txt|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_349.txt|He showed he has some things to learn.
p310_350.txt|Or do they?
p310_351.txt|They are the innocent victims.
p310_352.txt|It is now time for justice.
p310_353.txt|That is of no use.
p310_354.txt|I could have been offended.
p310_355.txt|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_356.txt|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_357.txt|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310_358.txt|This is the lowest of the low.
p310_359.txt|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p310_360.txt|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p310_361.txt|He's a nice guy.
p310_362.txt|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_363.txt|I love the moment of being first.
p310_364.txt|It is a decision which has paid off.
p310_365.txt|Their mind was already made up.
p310_366.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310_367.txt|But it's got to be worth it.
p310_368.txt|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_369.txt|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_370.txt|Alex is a big part of that future.
p310_371.txt|Pray that is so.
p310_372.txt|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_373.txt|There was support from across the board.
p310_374.txt|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_375.txt|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310_376.txt|So what does one do?
p310_377.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p310_378.txt|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_379.txt|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_380.txt|I joined a group.
p310_381.txt|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_382.txt|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310_383.txt|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_384.txt|And they all had these other commitments.
p310_385.txt|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p310_386.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p310_387.txt|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_388.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310_389.txt|I never agreed with that.
p310_390.txt|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_391.txt|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310_392.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_393.txt|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p310_394.txt|There was only one hole in it.
p310_395.txt|I don't think it's vital.
p310_396.txt|It might not survive the process.
p310_397.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_398.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p310_399.txt|The issue has still to be resolved.
p310_400.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310_401.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_402.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_403.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p310_404.txt|We were close, but not close enough.
p310_405.txt|And that started me thinking.
p310_406.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p310_407.txt|It brings together two essential elements.
p310_408.txt|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p310_409.txt|We had a reunion last week.
p310_410.txt|This will help our confidence.
p310_411.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p310_412.txt|They also have good neighbours.
p310_413.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p310_414.txt|Who has he fought?
p310_415.txt|The film is about the cost of genius.
p310_416.txt|They've been here before.
p310_417.txt|I want a free vote.
p310_418.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p310_419.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p310_420.txt|I think it's a disgrace.
p310_421.txt|So he should be.
p310_422.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310_423.txt|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p310_424.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p311_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p311_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p311_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p311_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p311_025.txt|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p311_026.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p311_027.txt|It is the whole package.
p311_028.txt|I was totally wrong.
p311_029.txt|It was a matter of chance.
p311_030.txt|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p311_031.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p311_032.txt|We keep a distance.
p311_033.txt|She went home from school and never returned.
p311_034.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p311_035.txt|With actors it is slightly different.
p311_036.txt|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_037.txt|They did a very good job.
p311_038.txt|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_039.txt|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p311_040.txt|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_041.txt|We must learn to finish.
p311_042.txt|There can be no two ways about it.
p311_043.txt|I knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044.txt|I am content with the silver.
p311_045.txt|People acted too quickly.
p311_046.txt|My heart is with the artist.
p311_047.txt|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048.txt|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049.txt|What would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050.txt|They are already on the way there.
p311_051.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052.txt|This is a holy place.
p311_053.txt|We will miss him very much.
p311_054.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p311_055.txt|They should go ahead as normal.
p311_056.txt|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311_057.txt|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311_058.txt|I just went a bit too far.
p311_059.txt|I am delighted for Simon.
p311_060.txt|His third goal was superb.
p311_061.txt|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062.txt|It has been declared.
p311_063.txt|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p311_064.txt|The scientific debate is dead.
p311_065.txt|Only one got through.
p311_066.txt|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311_067.txt|He is a visionary.
p311_068.txt|I was the trial judge in both.
p311_069.txt|I have a choice.
p311_070.txt|It happens in many countries.
p311_071.txt|It's not just about the shows.
p311_072.txt|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074.txt|Already the children are dying.
p311_075.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076.txt|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311_077.txt|I can't wait to meet him.
p311_078.txt|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_080.txt|We've got a job to do.
p311_081.txt|You just have to adjust.
p311_082.txt|Well, that's just a third district.
p311_083.txt|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p311_084.txt|They are there to help us.
p311_085.txt|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p311_086.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p311_087.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p311_088.txt|I have hardly any commitments.
p311_089.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p311_090.txt|It is a very special place.
p311_091.txt|Some things in life you have to accept.
p311_092.txt|I am relishing the challenge.
p311_093.txt|It is set in Paris.
p311_094.txt|The party has never fully recovered.
p311_095.txt|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_096.txt|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_097.txt|The initial report has been completed.
p311_098.txt|He's got me very well.
p311_099.txt|It's like an extension of your body.
p311_100.txt|It is quite a new prescription.
p311_101.txt|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_102.txt|Which he is, too.
p311_103.txt|These matters are now behind us.
p311_104.txt|But things are never the same again.
p311_105.txt|It is easy to agree with him.
p311_106.txt|He, too, will return.
p311_107.txt|Is there anything in the wound?
p311_108.txt|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_109.txt|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_110.txt|It is not really used by many people.
p311_111.txt|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_112.txt|He has one son and one daughter.
p311_113.txt|Don't get me wrong.
p311_114.txt|It is nearly there.
p311_115.txt|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_116.txt|I find it rather oppressive.
p311_117.txt|They are all Arabs.
p311_118.txt|It is already making a difference.
p311_119.txt|He decides to do something about it.
p311_120.txt|There were no new cases yesterday.
p311_121.txt|Someone else has now got them.
p311_122.txt|But once again it was not converted.
p311_123.txt|These figures are truly terrible.
p311_124.txt|This is a most serious matter.
p311_125.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p311_126.txt|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311_127.txt|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p311_128.txt|It was a bit of a shock.
p311_129.txt|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_130.txt|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311_131.txt|Planning is a key issue.
p311_132.txt|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_133.txt|The way ahead is not easy.
p311_134.txt|I could do a better job.
p311_135.txt|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_136.txt|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_137.txt|I get the bus.
p311_138.txt|We are still the best team in Britain.
p311_139.txt|They got the job done.
p311_140.txt|It's a horrific incident.
p311_141.txt|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311_142.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311_143.txt|We've not won anything yet.
p311_144.txt|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_145.txt|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p311_146.txt|They did not let him down.
p311_147.txt|I believe in trade unions.
p311_148.txt|This is in a league of its own.
p311_149.txt|It's been such a waste of money.
p311_150.txt|The money is not really our concern.
p311_151.txt|You just know it.
p311_152.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p311_153.txt|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_154.txt|We have the easy part.
p311_155.txt|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p311_156.txt|It's like a high school play.
p311_157.txt|He was part of South Africa.
p311_158.txt|It's there for people to look at.
p311_159.txt|The party will make up its own mind.
p311_160.txt|At least two women were among those arrested.
p311_161.txt|They never got into the show this time.
p311_162.txt|But no, it's not funny.
p311_163.txt|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311_164.txt|He changed my life.
p311_165.txt|There was nothing else to match it.
p311_166.txt|Two options are being proposed.
p311_167.txt|They haven't been thought through.
p311_168.txt|The criteria have changed.
p311_169.txt|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p311_170.txt|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311_171.txt|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_172.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p311_173.txt|This is a very interesting move.
p311_174.txt|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_175.txt|His only reply was a laugh.
p311_176.txt|those who are preparing to give up.
p311_177.txt|What kind of festival is proposed?
p311_178.txt|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_179.txt|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311_180.txt|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p311_181.txt|That will help my case a bit.
p311_182.txt|It was entirely justified.
p311_183.txt|He looked at me before replying.
p311_184.txt|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_185.txt|It feels that the game is off.
p311_186.txt|There will be no change in government.
p311_187.txt|Another man said, It was horrible.
p311_188.txt|But we still don't know.
p311_189.txt|Who do you think you are?
p311_190.txt|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_191.txt|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_192.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p311_193.txt|I have done ever since it was published.
p311_194.txt|Nobody could survive on that.
p311_195.txt|They seem to turn up for them.
p311_196.txt|They were kept there for a summer.
p311_197.txt|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_198.txt|It is that sort of film.
p311_199.txt|She was not hard done by.
p311_200.txt|Can you believe it?
p311_201.txt|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311_202.txt|They are now out in the cold.
p311_203.txt|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p311_204.txt|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_205.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p311_206.txt|This has been a shock.
p311_207.txt|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_208.txt|Everything in the symphony is there.
p311_209.txt|There has also been some Scots input.
p311_210.txt|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p311_211.txt|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_212.txt|But who will buy it?
p311_213.txt|It had to be more flexible.
p311_214.txt|Openness is always the best way.
p311_215.txt|It wouldn't go off.
p311_216.txt|It can be halted.
p311_217.txt|This was a lot of numbers.
p311_218.txt|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311_219.txt|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311_220.txt|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_221.txt|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_222.txt|The professor said the results were positive.
p311_223.txt|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p311_224.txt|But it's just great to have won.
p311_225.txt|And it paid off.
p311_226.txt|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_227.txt|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311_228.txt|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_229.txt|It should be scrapped.
p311_230.txt|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_231.txt|They are just trying to cover up.
p311_232.txt|We have to defend ourselves.
p311_233.txt|I came here this week to work.
p311_234.txt|Where do we go from here?
p311_235.txt|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_236.txt|He gets his moment.
p311_237.txt|This was an option from the beginning.
p311_238.txt|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_239.txt|It's not a party, no, no.
p311_240.txt|It's not that clear-cut.
p311_241.txt|It may not be life long.
p311_242.txt|It was just above the roof.
p311_243.txt|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311_244.txt|However, that is a sizeable if.
p311_245.txt|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_246.txt|The English are coming.
p311_247.txt|I believe in theatre.
p311_248.txt|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249.txt|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311_250.txt|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p311_252.txt|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_253.txt|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_254.txt|That's my daughter acting.
p311_255.txt|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_256.txt|The performance was really, really immense.
p311_257.txt|Faces from the Eighties.
p311_258.txt|The family baton is handed on.
p311_259.txt|How can this be?
p311_260.txt|We are still alive and kicking.
p311_261.txt|I want to go now.
p311_262.txt|There are many questions to be answered.
p311_263.txt|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_264.txt|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_265.txt|They said we were out of touch.
p311_266.txt|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311_267.txt|There is no signature.
p311_268.txt|There is no point in denying that.
p311_269.txt|The kids are paying the price.
p311_270.txt|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_271.txt|They didn't find any substance.
p311_272.txt|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_273.txt|I've never seen a game like it.
p311_274.txt|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_275.txt|He will do very well.
p311_276.txt|They also intend to travel today.
p311_277.txt|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_278.txt|The casualties were not named.
p311_279.txt|I was shaking on the blocks.
p311_280.txt|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_281.txt|I am very happy with life.
p311_282.txt|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_283.txt|My office is down there.
p311_284.txt|Even then this game was not over.
p311_285.txt|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_286.txt|We also hope to meet the men.
p311_287.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p311_288.txt|It has become very confused.
p311_289.txt|Fame and money followed.
p311_290.txt|I am not in denial.
p311_291.txt|Shelter also supports the reform.
p311_292.txt|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_293.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p311_294.txt|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_295.txt|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_296.txt|Then there's the Old Firm.
p311_297.txt|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_298.txt|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311_299.txt|They're not always the same person.
p311_300.txt|It would have to be backdated.
p311_301.txt|He said he was sorry.
p311_302.txt|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_303.txt|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p311_304.txt|We have worked well with them for years.
p311_305.txt|That was me today.
p311_306.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_307.txt|That is when we are really effective.
p311_308.txt|The director's a genius.
p311_309.txt|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_310.txt|It was the climax of the thing.
p311_311.txt|This is new money.
p311_312.txt|We have not given up on the game.
p311_313.txt|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_314.txt|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311_315.txt|Nobody should believe this story.
p311_316.txt|This is not out of choice.
p311_317.txt|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311_318.txt|But this one has a lot of potential.
p311_319.txt|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_320.txt|We'll see what happens.
p311_321.txt|This was another video cassette.
p311_322.txt|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311_323.txt|It will make a huge difference.
p311_324.txt|He pretended not to care.
p311_325.txt|Not because they want to sing about something.
p311_326.txt|I was in tears in the street.
p311_327.txt|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311_328.txt|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_329.txt|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_330.txt|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311_331.txt|That is why we are here.
p311_332.txt|The German had a point to make.
p311_333.txt|This time, however, may have been different.
p311_334.txt|You have to feel for the guy.
p311_335.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311_336.txt|Bomber was not amused.
p311_337.txt|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_338.txt|Was it just negligent.
p311_339.txt|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_340.txt|This Government is cutting taxes.
p311_341.txt|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_342.txt|This is a big club.
p311_343.txt|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311_344.txt|They will now get that support.
p311_345.txt|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_346.txt|It seemed so personal.
p311_347.txt|I've no problem with what they said.
p311_348.txt|He added that he felt undermined.
p311_349.txt|I think we have got the balance right.
p311_350.txt|Eriksson would have approved.
p311_351.txt|It is physical but it is also good.
p311_352.txt|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_353.txt|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_354.txt|So it goes on.
p311_355.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311_356.txt|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_357.txt|They should have listened to me.
p311_358.txt|I am greatly encouraged.
p311_359.txt|It was like someone had died.
p311_360.txt|What does he want him to look like?
p311_361.txt|The actors are confident and polished.
p311_362.txt|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_363.txt|We would have concerns about that.
p311_364.txt|Taxes may need to rise.
p311_365.txt|It's unusual to say the least.
p311_366.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_367.txt|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_368.txt|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_369.txt|We have some concerns.
p311_370.txt|So he was anxious to try something new.
p311_371.txt|This was a chilling echo.
p311_372.txt|They really want to do it.
p311_373.txt|And then he laughs.
p311_374.txt|I recommend a tour.
p311_375.txt|We don't ask for much.
p311_376.txt|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311_377.txt|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_378.txt|We have to start again on Saturday.
p311_379.txt|It feels like a winner already.
p311_380.txt|And it covers the spectrum.
p311_381.txt|The replacements made a big difference.
p311_382.txt|And the winners are.
p311_383.txt|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311_384.txt|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p311_385.txt|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_386.txt|There are big names.
p311_387.txt|My players are precious to me.
p311_388.txt|That argument has been won.
p311_389.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311_390.txt|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311_391.txt|I had to calm down.
p311_392.txt|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_393.txt|She returned home a few days later.
p311_394.txt|They haven't run away.
p311_395.txt|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_396.txt|She is fulfilled by it.
p311_397.txt|He said no survivors had been found.
p311_398.txt|Who can say?
p311_399.txt|It is the end of an era.
p311_400.txt|In short, the club was broke.
p311_401.txt|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311_402.txt|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_403.txt|The men are safe and unharmed.
p311_404.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p311_405.txt|It was the same old story.
p311_406.txt|I was frustrated here.
p311_407.txt|We have reacted well to each other.
p311_408.txt|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_409.txt|I was furious about it.
p311_410.txt|This will be no easy option.
p311_411.txt|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_412.txt|Of course we aren't.
p311_413.txt|We haven't been told.
p311_414.txt|It worked well in Monaco.
p311_415.txt|They were outside the circle.
p311_416.txt|The whole process was so different.
p311_417.txt|He also called in at another farm.
p311_418.txt|I agree with them.
p311_419.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p311_420.txt|We will listen to colleagues.
p311_421.txt|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311_422.txt|It's something we want to make work.
p311_423.txt|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p312_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p312_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p312_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p312_025.txt|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_026.txt|This was a rationing decision.
p312_027.txt|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_028.txt|He is doing the right things.
p312_029.txt|Blood samples were taken.
p312_030.txt|I've got the poster.
p312_031.txt|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_032.txt|We have a high quality product.
p312_033.txt|Haven't been so lucky since.
p312_034.txt|Well, you might have a point.
p312_035.txt|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_036.txt|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_037.txt|That decision is now being appealed.
p312_038.txt|This is really good news for us.
p312_039.txt|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312_040.txt|Not so, it transpires.
p312_041.txt|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_042.txt|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_043.txt|I think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044.txt|This is not a monument to the past.
p312_045.txt|I certainly hope not.
p312_046.txt|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312_047.txt|I feel pretty good.
p312_048.txt|The group will report back in the summer.
p312_049.txt|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p312_051.txt|I was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052.txt|We have to break that cycle.
p312_053.txt|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312_054.txt|The children are being very brave.
p312_055.txt|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056.txt|My only concern is for my children.
p312_057.txt|This is welcome news.
p312_058.txt|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059.txt|The trust has no magic wand.
p312_060.txt|We just wish they had done so before.
p312_061.txt|It was a virus.
p312_062.txt|The rest, of course, is history.
p312_063.txt|They chose the latter.
p312_064.txt|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312_065.txt|All were later allowed home.
p312_066.txt|Will you just put it away?
p312_067.txt|I think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068.txt|Who did the recruiting?
p312_069.txt|It is still with Ministers.
p312_070.txt|The effect was almost magical.
p312_071.txt|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312_072.txt|It showed him the way to drive.
p312_073.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074.txt|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p312_075.txt|Were they under-age?
p312_076.txt|He was charged with perjury.
p312_077.txt|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312_078.txt|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312_079.txt|The goal will come.
p312_080.txt|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081.txt|We didn't take our chances.
p312_082.txt|It was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083.txt|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_084.txt|There are many children.
p312_085.txt|That never seemed likely.
p312_086.txt|Action must be taken urgently.
p312_087.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p312_088.txt|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_089.txt|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312_090.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_091.txt|But these things are happening now.
p312_092.txt|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_093.txt|They should be swept away.
p312_094.txt|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_095.txt|It will be a challenging film.
p312_096.txt|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_097.txt|What happens next?
p312_098.txt|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312_099.txt|We could easily be cut again.
p312_100.txt|The plot is minimal.
p312_101.txt|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_102.txt|They're just a nonsense.
p312_103.txt|There may be some resistance.
p312_104.txt|I could not believe it.
p312_105.txt|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312_106.txt|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_107.txt|He will go a long way.
p312_108.txt|Then there was her childhood.
p312_109.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p312_110.txt|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_111.txt|It's so much more fun.
p312_112.txt|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_113.txt|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312_114.txt|Where do you think she is going?
p312_115.txt|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_116.txt|I am not against a further inquiry.
p312_117.txt|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_118.txt|It's a double whammy.
p312_119.txt|What's the theme?
p312_120.txt|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_121.txt|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312_122.txt|This latter suggestion is very important.
p312_123.txt|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_124.txt|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p312_125.txt|There was some merit in that.
p312_126.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_127.txt|What's wrong with that?
p312_128.txt|The pain is still acute.
p312_129.txt|His remit is specific.
p312_130.txt|It is a very big problem.
p312_131.txt|Frustration is not the word.
p312_132.txt|The police have to act to help them.
p312_133.txt|She was extremely rigid.
p312_134.txt|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p312_135.txt|But what lies ahead?
p312_136.txt|I am so upset.
p312_137.txt|I was blown out of proportion.
p312_138.txt|There was a definite prejudice.
p312_139.txt|It's the same with us.
p312_140.txt|It's an awful lot of money.
p312_141.txt|He was the architect.
p312_142.txt|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_143.txt|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_144.txt|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_145.txt|He, too, was not satisfied.
p312_146.txt|It's easy to see why.
p312_147.txt|I've never regretted coming here.
p312_148.txt|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p312_149.txt|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312_150.txt|We still have a long, long way to go.
p312_151.txt|I fell into it by accident.
p312_152.txt|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_153.txt|Where does it come from?
p312_154.txt|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312_155.txt|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p312_156.txt|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_157.txt|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_158.txt|That says something for his strength of character.
p312_159.txt|The world is being invited to visit.
p312_160.txt|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312_161.txt|I think it's a sensible change.
p312_162.txt|Sex is fun?
p312_163.txt|I'm not sure.
p312_164.txt|His first album was a hit.
p312_165.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p312_166.txt|And who would argue with that?
p312_167.txt|It was visibly on fire.
p312_168.txt|What's it for, after all?
p312_169.txt|Who would be out there, singing?
p312_170.txt|A number of people could not speak English.
p312_171.txt|They have got off with murder.
p312_172.txt|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_173.txt|This remains the party's policy.
p312_174.txt|I cannot say anymore.
p312_175.txt|They want this research to continue.
p312_176.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p312_177.txt|They are going to carry it through.
p312_178.txt|It was very, very dejected.
p312_179.txt|You can't keep them separate.
p312_180.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p312_181.txt|He was a legend.
p312_182.txt|That's when the story first appeared.
p312_183.txt|You're going to die.
p312_184.txt|There was a substantial explosion.
p312_185.txt|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_186.txt|I'm going to see my friend.
p312_187.txt|We played too deeply.
p312_188.txt|I probably would have been a dancer.
p312_189.txt|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_190.txt|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_191.txt|He never asked me for money.
p312_192.txt|I was a bit nervous.
p312_193.txt|There was no question of him not impressing.
p312_194.txt|However, we came through.
p312_195.txt|I love this tournament.
p312_196.txt|He had a heart problem.
p312_197.txt|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312_198.txt|It is a large number.
p312_199.txt|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p312_200.txt|Hear what they have to say.
p312_201.txt|Now there's a thought.
p312_202.txt|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_203.txt|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312_204.txt|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_205.txt|They told him to go to drama school.
p312_206.txt|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_207.txt|Let us hope so.
p312_208.txt|She looked very settled.
p312_209.txt|Of course he was right!
p312_210.txt|The next few months will tell.
p312_211.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_212.txt|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_213.txt|You can see their point.
p312_214.txt|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312_215.txt|The dangers are very obvious.
p312_216.txt|There were no casualties.
p312_217.txt|Is it in the right place?
p312_218.txt|I played well in my time there.
p312_219.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312_220.txt|They are still going to be impulsive.
p312_221.txt|I love you so very much.
p312_222.txt|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_223.txt|He is a very nice man.
p312_224.txt|We want to sort it out.
p312_225.txt|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_226.txt|Such a city does not exist.
p312_227.txt|It made me determined to get back.
p312_228.txt|It was no avail.
p312_229.txt|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_230.txt|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_231.txt|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312_232.txt|That is in the very nature of farming.
p312_233.txt|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312_234.txt|It was worth the wait.
p312_235.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_236.txt|It will take place in July.
p312_237.txt|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_238.txt|This is a major step forward for carers.
p312_239.txt|I think it was his parents.
p312_240.txt|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_241.txt|Partly, it is his own fault.
p312_242.txt|It's a personal matter.
p312_243.txt|That's where it all started.
p312_244.txt|I won't go back.
p312_245.txt|Why has it taken so long?
p312_246.txt|You make the choice.
p312_247.txt|And does it?
p312_248.txt|I was proud of our lads.
p312_249.txt|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_250.txt|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_251.txt|All would be under threat.
p312_252.txt|Was it a foul?
p312_253.txt|He leaves a beat.
p312_254.txt|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_255.txt|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_256.txt|Promises were not kept.
p312_257.txt|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312_258.txt|The claim was denied by first minister.
p312_259.txt|Who is he?
p312_260.txt|It has to be long-term commitment.
p312_261.txt|It was that bad, that low.
p312_262.txt|That would be a big mistake.
p312_263.txt|His arrival could be the making of them.
p312_264.txt|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312_265.txt|I said How much?
p312_266.txt|You are a liar.
p312_267.txt|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_268.txt|We're still talking about it.
p312_269.txt|She would say he was still the best.
p312_270.txt|He finished the night in a cell.
p312_271.txt|I'm not afraid of that.
p312_272.txt|I don't know what he was shouting.
p312_273.txt|It is the icing on the cake.
p312_274.txt|It was a new ball game.
p312_275.txt|The people here are quite reserved.
p312_276.txt|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_277.txt|Our legal advice is clear.
p312_278.txt|The past is history, not destiny.
p312_279.txt|These were the edited highlights.
p312_280.txt|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_281.txt|They were totally behind it.
p312_282.txt|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312_283.txt|We could do a lot worse.
p312_284.txt|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_285.txt|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_286.txt|It is all one-sided.
p312_287.txt|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312_288.txt|That was the initial attraction.
p312_289.txt|Who will take them after that?
p312_290.txt|He's also thinking long-term.
p312_291.txt|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_292.txt|Trevor has been great.
p312_293.txt|It would also take time.
p312_294.txt|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p312_295.txt|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p312_296.txt|I was first in the door.
p312_297.txt|It is highly unlikely.
p312_298.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p312_299.txt|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_300.txt|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312_301.txt|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_302.txt|What makes a house a home?
p312_303.txt|Destruction came from within.
p312_304.txt|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312_305.txt|It is good to look back.
p312_306.txt|You can't do one without the other.
p312_307.txt|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_308.txt|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312_309.txt|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_310.txt|I would say so.
p312_311.txt|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312_312.txt|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p312_313.txt|And they did just that.
p312_314.txt|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_315.txt|She has left the island.
p312_316.txt|They had three children.
p312_317.txt|Our system is archaic.
p312_318.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p312_319.txt|We want to know about the policy.
p312_320.txt|It is not illegal.
p312_321.txt|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_322.txt|We don't have the credible evidence.
p312_323.txt|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312_324.txt|It's one up to the Scots.
p312_325.txt|This is complete nonsense.
p312_326.txt|I don't want to use the term.
p312_327.txt|There is still hope.
p312_328.txt|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_329.txt|It's all happening at a local level.
p312_330.txt|She is a great talent.
p312_331.txt|It's the big omission.
p312_332.txt|We do things in an appropriate way.
p312_334.txt|However, she is female, and so.
p312_335.txt|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_336.txt|He will be advised by me.
p312_337.txt|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_338.txt|It's part of your life.
p312_339.txt|He had a horror.
p312_340.txt|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_341.txt|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_342.txt|That was the biggest game of my life.
p312_343.txt|This is perfectly legal.
p312_344.txt|That's the most important thing for me.
p312_345.txt|Then came the second round.
p312_346.txt|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312_347.txt|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_348.txt|We told them in June.
p312_349.txt|Parents should avoid it.
p312_350.txt|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p312_351.txt|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_352.txt|And she's not even in the book!
p312_353.txt|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_354.txt|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_355.txt|He, too, is killing.
p312_356.txt|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_357.txt|It's better to be happy.
p312_358.txt|It's just so sad.
p312_359.txt|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312_360.txt|And Scotland is no different.
p312_361.txt|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_362.txt|We are in a learning curve.
p312_363.txt|He can do everything.
p312_364.txt|She was just that sort of person.
p312_365.txt|Is it a warning to parents?
p312_366.txt|You've gotten all the facts.
p312_367.txt|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_368.txt|Soon the whole country will be level.
p312_369.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312_370.txt|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_371.txt|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_372.txt|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p312_373.txt|He said he needed no more evidence.
p312_374.txt|It's such a tragedy.
p312_375.txt|It was a long time coming.
p312_376.txt|Gordon Brown was superb.
p312_377.txt|The referee didn't do his job.
p312_378.txt|We are very nearly there.
p312_379.txt|Stand by for action.
p312_380.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_381.txt|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312_382.txt|The urgency is real.
p312_383.txt|They have been for some time now.
p312_384.txt|It was only logical to end it.
p312_385.txt|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p312_386.txt|I've no passion for any country.
p312_387.txt|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312_388.txt|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389.txt|That's an old idea.
p312_390.txt|It is part and parcel of it.
p312_391.txt|The only safe investment is cash.
p312_392.txt|It's the whole season.
p312_393.txt|We had no choice but to go down.
p312_394.txt|We are keen to have him back.
p312_395.txt|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_396.txt|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p312_397.txt|And we all understand that.
p312_398.txt|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_399.txt|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p312_400.txt|Do what you have to do.
p312_401.txt|We must do well in that.
p312_402.txt|She died later on Monday.
p312_403.txt|No-one has yet been charged.
p312_404.txt|If so, they were wrong.
p312_405.txt|This is my big break.
p312_406.txt|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_407.txt|There is no easy answer.
p312_408.txt|There was someone on the floor.
p312_409.txt|I put pressure on him.
p312_410.txt|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_411.txt|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_412.txt|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_413.txt|He will never walk the streets again.
p312_414.txt|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_415.txt|Golf has lost a great character.
p312_416.txt|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312_417.txt|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312_418.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p312_419.txt|There was no pressure at all.
p316_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p316_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p316_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p316_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316_009.txt|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p316_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316_025.txt|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p316_026.txt|Meetings will also remain private.
p316_027.txt|Have we tried everything?
p316_028.txt|It's not going to work out that way.
p316_029.txt|We have worked hard.
p316_030.txt|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p316_031.txt|Naturally, she said yes.
p316_032.txt|This is not a war on terror.
p316_033.txt|It is not for any other purpose.
p316_034.txt|There will always be problems on the way.
p316_035.txt|Why you did it will never be known.
p316_036.txt|He was in his element.
p316_037.txt|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316_038.txt|What a week he has had.
p316_039.txt|We just want this season to end.
p316_040.txt|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_041.txt|There is a new confidence about the club.
p316_042.txt|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316_043.txt|We accept the challenge.
p316_044.txt|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316_045.txt|After that it is up to the boss.
p316_046.txt|They were taken to prove a point.
p316_047.txt|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316_048.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p316_049.txt|So, why does he do it?
p316_050.txt|I would love to have him home.
p316_051.txt|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316_052.txt|He had no enemies.
p316_053.txt|That is not the case this time.
p316_054.txt|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316_055.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p316_056.txt|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057.txt|There was only silence.
p316_058.txt|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316_059.txt|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060.txt|However, our players will fight for that.
p316_061.txt|Everyone was very saddened.
p316_062.txt|He declined to give further details.
p316_063.txt|He said it was for sale.
p316_064.txt|This is a dream come true.
p316_065.txt|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316_066.txt|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067.txt|What on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068.txt|This is far too high.
p316_069.txt|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070.txt|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316_071.txt|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072.txt|It has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073.txt|He was also a great man.
p316_074.txt|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075.txt|It is clear that change is required.
p316_076.txt|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316_077.txt|This is a big step up.
p316_078.txt|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_079.txt|The judge was very nice.
p316_080.txt|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081.txt|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082.txt|Most of them have already gone home.
p316_083.txt|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p316_084.txt|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316_085.txt|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p316_086.txt|Can you imagine a world without design?
p316_087.txt|He was caught and fired.
p316_088.txt|I feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089.txt|The driver escaped injury.
p316_090.txt|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_091.txt|There was no bad behaviour.
p316_092.txt|Today she has been released.
p316_093.txt|It's a much bigger problem.
p316_094.txt|There are no problems between us at all.
p316_095.txt|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316_096.txt|I've had it for the exams.
p316_097.txt|I hope it comes out all right.
p316_098.txt|I will just have to be patient.
p316_099.txt|It's a sensible management decision.
p316_100.txt|I kept it very simple.
p316_101.txt|The rest was badminton.
p316_102.txt|It will take several days.
p316_103.txt|We had to push to get a goal.
p316_104.txt|That got me out.
p316_105.txt|I would just like someone to confess.
p316_106.txt|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_107.txt|It will have to ratify the deal.
p316_108.txt|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_109.txt|I was not a joiner.
p316_110.txt|It has to find out what went wrong.
p316_111.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p316_112.txt|It has until Saturday.
p316_113.txt|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_114.txt|She has the biggest part.
p316_115.txt|We will win this tie.
p316_116.txt|This is totally untrue.
p316_117.txt|Or someone wants to say something different.
p316_118.txt|I think they have to change that.
p316_119.txt|This series is for real.
p316_120.txt|It's great news, isn't it.
p316_121.txt|It's very ingenious.
p316_122.txt|That would depend on the parole board.
p316_123.txt|It is all up to the Members.
p316_124.txt|The two sets are different.
p316_125.txt|And now the pressure is off.
p316_126.txt|You can see the appeal of running away.
p316_127.txt|Their opening was disastrous.
p316_128.txt|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316_129.txt|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_130.txt|The following are the principal provisions.
p316_131.txt|Too much has already been said.
p316_132.txt|Now, however, things are different.
p316_133.txt|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p316_134.txt|She is not the world champion.
p316_135.txt|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_136.txt|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p316_137.txt|He is a bully.
p316_138.txt|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_139.txt|I've won the British.
p316_140.txt|And so the cycle continues.
p316_141.txt|I don't have many friends.
p316_142.txt|However, it was a different story in the final.
p316_143.txt|They exist in name alone.
p316_144.txt|I am not retiring.
p316_145.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p316_146.txt|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p316_147.txt|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316_148.txt|Feel for five seconds.
p316_149.txt|I hope it is a good omen.
p316_150.txt|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316_151.txt|They will appear again next week.
p316_152.txt|Failure is not an option.
p316_153.txt|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_154.txt|You look at that.
p316_155.txt|Things begin to spring to life.
p316_156.txt|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316_157.txt|I understood that concern.
p316_158.txt|The things writers and directors say!
p316_159.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p316_160.txt|It was like a dream to be here.
p316_161.txt|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_162.txt|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316_163.txt|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_164.txt|We did not deserve to go through.
p316_165.txt|It's got to be in the head.
p316_166.txt|It certainly sounded it at times.
p316_167.txt|It will be too hot.
p316_168.txt|That happens in boxing.
p316_169.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p316_170.txt|None of the opinions is good.
p316_171.txt|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_172.txt|They must not succeed.
p316_173.txt|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_174.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p316_175.txt|I have never seen him like that.
p316_176.txt|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_177.txt|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316_178.txt|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316_179.txt|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316_180.txt|We played better after the break.
p316_181.txt|But this relative success has not been easy.
p316_182.txt|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_183.txt|Of course it is still possible.
p316_184.txt|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p316_185.txt|That, in a way, is the point.
p316_186.txt|What is so unusual about this case?
p316_187.txt|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p316_188.txt|That would end it for us.
p316_189.txt|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_190.txt|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p316_191.txt|I just love lessons.
p316_192.txt|Retirement is on his mind.
p316_193.txt|It's to do with this place.
p316_194.txt|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_195.txt|We shall not be moved.
p316_196.txt|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316_197.txt|It is not just the agencies.
p316_198.txt|There must be boundaries.
p316_199.txt|However, he was later released without charge.
p316_200.txt|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_201.txt|I watch the other visitors.
p316_202.txt|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_204.txt|He confirmed his fitness.
p316_205.txt|The gap is narrowing.
p316_206.txt|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_207.txt|Both men were uninjured.
p316_208.txt|My husband was fighting for his life.
p316_209.txt|It is not a financial issue.
p316_210.txt|We are in this for the long haul.
p316_211.txt|We have a budget in March.
p316_212.txt|There was no respite.
p316_213.txt|I got very, very tired.
p316_214.txt|I am really sorry that he is going.
p316_215.txt|They will do their own thing.
p316_216.txt|It is too much for me.
p316_217.txt|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_218.txt|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_219.txt|We've made a couple of albums.
p316_220.txt|We need a much wider debate.
p316_221.txt|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_222.txt|Look at a computer.
p316_223.txt|They went back to the seventeenth.
p316_224.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p316_225.txt|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_226.txt|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316_227.txt|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p316_228.txt|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316_229.txt|I waited and waited.
p316_230.txt|We all knew it could not be true.
p316_231.txt|Its future is uncertain.
p316_232.txt|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_233.txt|It doesn't look good for her.
p316_234.txt|She said he did not look too happy.
p316_235.txt|We are aware of the problem.
p316_236.txt|Where will the elderly go then?
p316_237.txt|Then it was changed without notice.
p316_238.txt|He had a great game.
p316_239.txt|The following year, they asked him again.
p316_240.txt|It is the men who create the demand.
p316_241.txt|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_242.txt|Every case is completely different.
p316_243.txt|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316_244.txt|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_245.txt|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p316_246.txt|It will be fine.
p316_247.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p316_248.txt|They are you, the fans.
p316_249.txt|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_250.txt|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p316_251.txt|What a difference a game can make.
p316_252.txt|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316_253.txt|Why do it?
p316_254.txt|It opened last month.
p316_255.txt|This will be our new beginning.
p316_256.txt|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p316_257.txt|I have totally had enough.
p316_258.txt|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_259.txt|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_260.txt|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p316_261.txt|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_262.txt|What are you waiting for?
p316_263.txt|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316_264.txt|This is still happening in the US.
p316_265.txt|Another issue will be policing.
p316_266.txt|Today was first class.
p316_267.txt|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_268.txt|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p316_269.txt|This is a good move for me.
p316_270.txt|Feel the heat?
p316_271.txt|She was so full of life.
p316_272.txt|I should have given him one in return.
p316_273.txt|I began to pray.
p316_274.txt|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_275.txt|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_276.txt|I just wanted to fly.
p316_277.txt|And he has a tale to tell.
p316_278.txt|Footballers have also been targeted.
p316_279.txt|The deadline is real and absolute.
p316_280.txt|So, how did this happen?
p316_281.txt|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_282.txt|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_283.txt|There are no quick fixes.
p316_284.txt|The change was not instant.
p316_285.txt|We've got the bronze.
p316_286.txt|They use them for everything.
p316_287.txt|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_288.txt|We are not defeated.
p316_289.txt|He knows what he's got to do.
p316_290.txt|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p316_291.txt|We have been going for three years.
p316_292.txt|We deserved the three points.
p316_293.txt|It is planned for London in the spring.
p316_294.txt|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_295.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p316_296.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_297.txt|Which brings us to the point.
p316_298.txt|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_299.txt|I am quite excited about it.
p316_300.txt|Everyone agrees with that.
p316_301.txt|She had denied the charge.
p316_302.txt|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p316_303.txt|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_304.txt|I didn't feel good.
p316_305.txt|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_306.txt|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_307.txt|Let's get to know him.
p316_308.txt|We have got to attack.
p316_309.txt|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p316_310.txt|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_311.txt|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_312.txt|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p316_313.txt|How would it work?
p316_314.txt|We told them in July.
p316_315.txt|The film was great.
p316_316.txt|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_317.txt|It's a real challenge.
p316_318.txt|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_319.txt|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316_320.txt|There was too much at stake.
p316_321.txt|I read about it in the newspapers.
p316_322.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p316_323.txt|Is that not uncanny?
p316_324.txt|It has to reinvent itself.
p316_325.txt|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316_326.txt|He was happy with his form.
p316_327.txt|His art was not just about emotions.
p316_328.txt|Nato was not a love affair.
p316_329.txt|It's a production company.
p316_330.txt|But we will not be scared.
p316_331.txt|But that is not an issue for now.
p316_332.txt|It will not work in our favour.
p316_333.txt|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316_334.txt|He is on the wrong side.
p316_335.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p316_336.txt|There will be no receivers.
p316_337.txt|My son was too young to die.
p316_338.txt|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_339.txt|It's a national sport.
p316_340.txt|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316_341.txt|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316_342.txt|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_343.txt|I was shocked and outraged.
p316_344.txt|Not many people like to do that.
p316_345.txt|It was extremely cold.
p316_346.txt|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_347.txt|People are using it in their daily lives.
p316_348.txt|Chelsea was a great club.
p316_349.txt|We have to open up.
p316_350.txt|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_351.txt|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_352.txt|The pensioners did not want to know.
p316_353.txt|It was just awful.
p316_354.txt|We are doing okay in the league.
p316_355.txt|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_356.txt|It is time for concerted national action.
p316_357.txt|Do you know who we are?
p316_358.txt|Souter will be back.
p316_359.txt|I'd like to report a murder.
p316_360.txt|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_361.txt|It certainly gives you hope.
p316_362.txt|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p316_363.txt|Two people have died.
p316_364.txt|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_365.txt|I am delighted to have her back home.
p316_366.txt|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_367.txt|It is based on his movement records.
p316_368.txt|It wasn't an easy decision.
p316_369.txt|It left me with sadness.
p316_370.txt|There is a changing of the guard.
p316_371.txt|The boys are very confident.
p316_372.txt|It was our time maybe.
p316_373.txt|I know we can play a lot better.
p316_374.txt|We said it will happen one night.
p316_375.txt|It is a flexible concept.
p316_376.txt|This election is far from over.
p316_377.txt|So the Government will be damaged.
p316_378.txt|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316_379.txt|However, we let them back into the game.
p316_380.txt|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316_381.txt|Is that such a bad thing?
p316_382.txt|You do need a check and a balance.
p316_383.txt|Thousands of people were missing.
p316_384.txt|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_385.txt|It's time to move on.
p316_386.txt|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_387.txt|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316_388.txt|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p316_389.txt|I can't describe it.
p316_390.txt|It changed my life.
p316_391.txt|But what will we put on it?
p316_392.txt|It will benefit a lot of people.
p316_393.txt|A new school will be built.
p316_394.txt|There may be hope this year, however.
p316_395.txt|That is not too bad.
p316_396.txt|They are taking a stand against this.
p316_397.txt|They are not left wing.
p316_398.txt|I was the sheep.
p316_399.txt|I think we believed the tie was won.
p316_400.txt|Well, there you go.
p316_401.txt|How do you find the youngsters?
p316_402.txt|It was a great team effort.
p316_403.txt|In my experience, he does not do that.
p316_404.txt|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316_405.txt|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_406.txt|Its first awards will just do that.
p316_407.txt|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_408.txt|That is my preference.
p316_409.txt|Taxation should be simplified.
p316_410.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_411.txt|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_412.txt|I have signed a contract.
p316_413.txt|I have never been overly ambitious.
p316_414.txt|We were beaten by the better team.
p316_415.txt|I hope you don't regret it.
p316_416.txt|He was all blackened.
p316_417.txt|This is your country.
p316_418.txt|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_419.txt|Audiences there were shocked.
p316_420.txt|They responded in the most positive way.
p316_421.txt|The British government said she was coming home.
p316_422.txt|We won very easily.
p316_423.txt|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p329_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p329_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p329_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p329_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p329_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p329_025.txt|But there has never been the time, she said.
p329_026.txt|This could be one such case, he declared.
p329_027.txt|It's not a solo.
p329_028.txt|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_029.txt|I fell in love with ballet.
p329_030.txt|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329_031.txt|I had found my vision.
p329_032.txt|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329_033.txt|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p329_034.txt|We don't know the scale of need.
p329_035.txt|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329_036.txt|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_037.txt|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329_038.txt|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p329_039.txt|We're still talking with a few people.
p329_040.txt|We know you will not let us down.
p329_041.txt|He will never walk the streets again.
p329_042.txt|There are big names.
p329_043.txt|That argument has been won.
p329_044.txt|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p329_045.txt|I hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046.txt|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047.txt|The bill would be massive.
p329_048.txt|He was just a journalist.
p329_049.txt|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p329_050.txt|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051.txt|I didn't have a clue.
p329_052.txt|How can they engage with the work?
p329_053.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054.txt|She has a wonderful mind.
p329_055.txt|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056.txt|We're into that build-up now.
p329_057.txt|It is the end of an era.
p329_058.txt|I have had no social life at all.
p329_059.txt|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060.txt|In short, the club was broke.
p329_061.txt|His charisma is all on the course.
p329_062.txt|I am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063.txt|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p329_064.txt|We're not the tourist board.
p329_065.txt|It was the same old story.
p329_066.txt|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329_067.txt|The Commons is too outdated.
p329_068.txt|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329_069.txt|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070.txt|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329_071.txt|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p329_073.txt|He would be with his peers.
p329_074.txt|They seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075.txt|This will be no easy option.
p329_076.txt|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329_077.txt|I am so sorry.
p329_078.txt|This avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079.txt|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329_080.txt|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081.txt|I was there for five hours.
p329_082.txt|But then he changed his mind.
p329_083.txt|I don't know why she is not here.
p329_084.txt|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329_085.txt|There are no excuses.
p329_086.txt|I feel very strongly about that.
p329_087.txt|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_088.txt|He just wants to play.
p329_089.txt|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_090.txt|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_091.txt|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_092.txt|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_093.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p329_094.txt|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_095.txt|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_096.txt|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_097.txt|Drugs are always an issue.
p329_098.txt|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_099.txt|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_100.txt|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329_101.txt|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_102.txt|There is no guarantee.
p329_103.txt|We make good weapons.
p329_104.txt|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_105.txt|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329_106.txt|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_107.txt|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_108.txt|It may be argued.
p329_109.txt|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329_110.txt|I bought a car at auction.
p329_111.txt|They agree to meet.
p329_112.txt|They could not hear.
p329_113.txt|It has been hijacked.
p329_114.txt|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_115.txt|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p329_116.txt|She had been sexually assaulted.
p329_117.txt|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_118.txt|That is different from being impartial.
p329_119.txt|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_120.txt|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329_121.txt|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p329_122.txt|David was not either.
p329_123.txt|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_124.txt|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_125.txt|More patience and composure was required.
p329_126.txt|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_127.txt|There is no smoking gun.
p329_128.txt|The trial is set for February.
p329_129.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p329_130.txt|It was an ambush.
p329_131.txt|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329_132.txt|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329_133.txt|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p329_134.txt|Is that too much to ask?
p329_135.txt|I have so much respect for him.
p329_136.txt|Each one has its own system.
p329_137.txt|I felt under no pressure today.
p329_138.txt|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_139.txt|And that was the adults.
p329_140.txt|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329_141.txt|That is a job for the Government.
p329_142.txt|And he had much need.
p329_143.txt|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_144.txt|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_145.txt|This can only help us go forward.
p329_146.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_147.txt|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329_148.txt|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329_149.txt|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_150.txt|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329_151.txt|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329_152.txt|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_153.txt|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_154.txt|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_155.txt|I guess it is down to focus.
p329_156.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329_157.txt|I have great respect for all my players.
p329_158.txt|His track record is not promising.
p329_159.txt|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p329_160.txt|For a moment it was all about her.
p329_161.txt|It will be a great night.
p329_162.txt|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329_163.txt|Trading Places was too obvious.
p329_164.txt|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p329_165.txt|That's the way it is.
p329_166.txt|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_167.txt|I see the extended family once a year.
p329_168.txt|I am not a magician.
p329_169.txt|We couldn't go very fast.
p329_170.txt|There was even a joke.
p329_171.txt|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p329_172.txt|You probably have never seen them before.
p329_173.txt|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329_174.txt|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_175.txt|It is highly unlikely.
p329_176.txt|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_177.txt|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_178.txt|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p329_179.txt|It is too early to speculate.
p329_180.txt|I love the moment of being first.
p329_181.txt|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329_182.txt|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_183.txt|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p329_184.txt|Or so we have long assumed.
p329_185.txt|They responded with victories.
p329_186.txt|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329_187.txt|What is the truth about the cow?
p329_188.txt|They will want to watch a winning team.
p329_189.txt|I think it's awful.
p329_190.txt|Who is going to be penalised?
p329_191.txt|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_192.txt|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329_193.txt|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329_194.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p329_195.txt|It is a scandal.
p329_196.txt|Nor should there have been.
p329_197.txt|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_198.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p329_199.txt|I have a theory.
p329_200.txt|But these were the nights.
p329_201.txt|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p329_202.txt|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329_203.txt|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_204.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p329_205.txt|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p329_206.txt|We will not break even.
p329_207.txt|We will look into it.
p329_208.txt|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_209.txt|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p329_210.txt|What did they think of her voice?
p329_211.txt|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_212.txt|Three years probation is just a joke.
p329_213.txt|We did not talk about it.
p329_214.txt|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329_215.txt|The court has not decided.
p329_216.txt|We are opening an inquiry.
p329_217.txt|I get to work with very good people.
p329_218.txt|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_219.txt|We find this very sad.
p329_220.txt|Four people died instantly.
p329_221.txt|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p329_222.txt|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p329_223.txt|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_224.txt|It is a step on the way.
p329_225.txt|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_226.txt|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329_227.txt|People tended to stay there for some time.
p329_228.txt|All businesses continue to trade.
p329_229.txt|It's a difficult job.
p329_230.txt|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_231.txt|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_232.txt|This represents a tough game for us.
p329_233.txt|The boy is no longer with us.
p329_234.txt|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_235.txt|This is my new career.
p329_236.txt|It really was a masterful innings.
p329_237.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329_238.txt|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_239.txt|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_240.txt|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329_241.txt|I was happiest with my short game.
p329_242.txt|I leave tonight for England.
p329_243.txt|There is no change in our position.
p329_244.txt|Everything else is a bonus.
p329_245.txt|We went on to become very successful.
p329_246.txt|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_247.txt|We must learn from the past.
p329_248.txt|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p329_249.txt|We told them in August.
p329_250.txt|That could be at least five years away.
p329_251.txt|That is my role.
p329_252.txt|I have no comment to make.
p329_253.txt|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_254.txt|He also presented You Bet!
p329_255.txt|I just went a bit too far.
p329_256.txt|And how he kept his word.
p329_257.txt|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_258.txt|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329_259.txt|He was a crazy man.
p329_260.txt|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_261.txt|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_262.txt|I have no argument with Scotland.
p329_263.txt|And a film maker was born.
p329_264.txt|It was also put on the Internet.
p329_265.txt|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329_266.txt|I hope he stays.
p329_267.txt|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_268.txt|Now that was a boxing movie.
p329_269.txt|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_270.txt|There was a battle there.
p329_271.txt|I might also completely change the routine.
p329_272.txt|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_273.txt|It's good news and long overdue.
p329_274.txt|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_275.txt|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329_276.txt|I saw them not long after it happened.
p329_277.txt|He doesn't do dinner.
p329_278.txt|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_279.txt|That's a very strong element.
p329_280.txt|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_281.txt|I have beaten her a few times.
p329_282.txt|He was at home with his pals.
p329_283.txt|We are taking it seriously.
p329_284.txt|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329_285.txt|Maybe this battle has been.
p329_286.txt|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_287.txt|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p329_288.txt|Then followed a bout of flu.
p329_289.txt|I have worked with him on projects.
p329_290.txt|We had no part in it.
p329_291.txt|His father and mother are in film production.
p329_292.txt|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_293.txt|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_294.txt|The referee had been right.
p329_295.txt|Our young people are leaving.
p329_296.txt|That would have been too easy.
p329_297.txt|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_298.txt|This is not a faceless system.
p329_299.txt|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_300.txt|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301.txt|That is just a load of baloney.
p329_302.txt|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_303.txt|The damage from the fire was huge.
p329_304.txt|She had kept the news from him.
p329_305.txt|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_306.txt|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_307.txt|A play is a set of actions.
p329_308.txt|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329_309.txt|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p329_310.txt|The campaign was raucous.
p329_311.txt|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_312.txt|But both were involved with other matters.
p329_313.txt|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p329_314.txt|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329_315.txt|There is no threat to them.
p329_316.txt|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_317.txt|Nelson does not disappoint.
p329_318.txt|The woman is basically off her head.
p329_319.txt|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_320.txt|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_321.txt|It is high time to act.
p329_322.txt|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329_323.txt|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329_324.txt|The South African defended his work ethic.
p329_325.txt|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_326.txt|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_327.txt|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_328.txt|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329_329.txt|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_330.txt|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329_331.txt|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p329_332.txt|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p329_333.txt|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329_334.txt|That is not the way we should operate.
p329_335.txt|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_336.txt|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p329_337.txt|We have nothing to hide.
p329_338.txt|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_339.txt|I'll take the blame for that.
p329_340.txt|It is now time for justice.
p329_341.txt|That is no use.
p329_342.txt|There is great interest on our island.
p329_343.txt|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_344.txt|Our house was very small.
p329_345.txt|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329_346.txt|Later they changed their minds.
p329_347.txt|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329_348.txt|First is open defiance.
p329_349.txt|That is absolute nonsense.
p329_350.txt|I just had so much fun.
p329_351.txt|It was quite rigorous.
p329_352.txt|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_353.txt|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_354.txt|Their mind was already made up.
p329_355.txt|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_356.txt|We do not expect any surplus.
p329_357.txt|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_358.txt|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_359.txt|Pray that it is so.
p329_360.txt|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329_361.txt|There was support from across the board.
p329_362.txt|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_363.txt|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329_364.txt|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p329_365.txt|We have been preparing all year.
p329_366.txt|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_367.txt|So what does one do?
p329_368.txt|Such actions are rarely popular.
p329_369.txt|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_370.txt|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_371.txt|I joined a group.
p329_372.txt|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_373.txt|They probably expected something special from me.
p329_374.txt|But we could not change his mind.
p329_375.txt|We have a team to reach the final.
p329_376.txt|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329_377.txt|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_378.txt|I see no reason for them to be.
p329_379.txt|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329_380.txt|I never agreed with that.
p329_381.txt|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_382.txt|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_383.txt|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329_384.txt|It is a dilemma.
p329_385.txt|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_386.txt|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_387.txt|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_388.txt|They did not interfere.
p329_389.txt|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_390.txt|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_391.txt|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_392.txt|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p329_393.txt|My father died in childbirth.
p329_394.txt|As if he were a High Court judge.
p329_395.txt|And that started me thinking.
p329_396.txt|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p329_397.txt|It brings together two essential elements.
p329_398.txt|The issue has still to be resolved.
p329_399.txt|He is a joy to watch.
p329_400.txt|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_401.txt|We are now open.
p329_402.txt|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_403.txt|Who has he fought?
p329_404.txt|The film is about the cost of genius.
p329_405.txt|They've been here before.
p329_406.txt|I want a free vote.
p329_407.txt|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p329_408.txt|It would show them a positive way forward.
p329_409.txt|Players were held in equally low regard.
p329_410.txt|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329_411.txt|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p329_412.txt|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329_413.txt|They have the cash to do that.
p329_414.txt|He was not seeking special advantage.
p329_415.txt|There was a fine line to tread.
p329_416.txt|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329_417.txt|It is so elusive and light.
p329_418.txt|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p329_419.txt|We've come from a long way back.
p329_420.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p329_421.txt|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p329_422.txt|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329_423.txt|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329_424.txt|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p330_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p330_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p330_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p330_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p330_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p330_025.txt|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p330_026.txt|I was backing him up.
p330_027.txt|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p330_028.txt|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330_029.txt|That was their attitude.
p330_030.txt|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330_031.txt|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p330_032.txt|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p330_033.txt|And it had two seats.
p330_034.txt|They could move in at any moment.
p330_035.txt|There were no reported injuries.
p330_036.txt|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330_037.txt|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p330_038.txt|It is my nature.
p330_039.txt|Or so she thought.
p330_040.txt|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330_041.txt|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p330_042.txt|We did not even get a free kick.
p330_043.txt|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330_044.txt|Our decision making was poor.
p330_045.txt|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330_046.txt|They said we were out of touch.
p330_047.txt|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330_048.txt|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330_049.txt|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p330_050.txt|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p330_051.txt|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p330_052.txt|He has one son and one daughter.
p330_053.txt|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p330_054.txt|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330_055.txt|Scotland had great assets.
p330_056.txt|We shall not forget him.
p330_057.txt|And thought we would get away with it.
p330_058.txt|I think they should have more respect.
p330_059.txt|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p330_060.txt|This is a big club.
p330_061.txt|I find it rather oppressive.
p330_062.txt|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330_063.txt|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330_064.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p330_065.txt|We have to expand.
p330_066.txt|Others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067.txt|We gave everything we had.
p330_068.txt|I think it is a release of tension.
p330_069.txt|This is a most serious matter.
p330_070.txt|I let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071.txt|It is also very valuable.
p330_072.txt|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330_073.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p330_074.txt|This makes up for it.
p330_075.txt|This is purely financial.
p330_076.txt|I want to help other women.
p330_077.txt|The problem is Labour.
p330_078.txt|The way ahead is not easy.
p330_079.txt|I could do a better job.
p330_080.txt|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p330_081.txt|An announcement will follow in due course.
p330_082.txt|I am here to play football.
p330_083.txt|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p330_084.txt|That is the crunch.
p330_085.txt|I did not want any damage to us.
p330_086.txt|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p330_087.txt|It was an easy decision to come here.
p330_088.txt|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p330_089.txt|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p330_090.txt|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091.txt|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092.txt|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p330_093.txt|This will be great for the young lads.
p330_094.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p330_095.txt|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p330_096.txt|What do we do for an encore?
p330_097.txt|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330_098.txt|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p330_099.txt|There's nothing for the kids.
p330_100.txt|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330_101.txt|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p330_102.txt|The feeling is marvellous.
p330_103.txt|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330_104.txt|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p330_105.txt|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p330_106.txt|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p330_107.txt|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330_108.txt|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p330_109.txt|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p330_110.txt|The money is not really our concern.
p330_111.txt|You just know it.
p330_112.txt|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330_113.txt|Don't say you have not been warned.
p330_114.txt|Some were close to tears.
p330_115.txt|Seven children had lost both parents.
p330_116.txt|So, how will it be received in the US?
p330_117.txt|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330_118.txt|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330_119.txt|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p330_120.txt|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p330_121.txt|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p330_122.txt|Some people still think she should be English.
p330_123.txt|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p330_124.txt|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330_125.txt|Who will perform?
p330_126.txt|It's like a high school play.
p330_127.txt|He was part of South Africa.
p330_128.txt|It's much more dynamic.
p330_129.txt|The party will make up its own mind.
p330_130.txt|What do they pay to join the club?
p330_131.txt|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330_132.txt|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330_133.txt|We are now in a safe place.
p330_134.txt|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330_135.txt|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330_136.txt|It will be very useful for us.
p330_137.txt|He was obviously very genuine.
p330_138.txt|We told them in July.
p330_139.txt|It's like a garage.
p330_140.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p330_141.txt|No Briton has ever won.
p330_142.txt|The answer is with ourselves.
p330_143.txt|That is the last thing they need.
p330_144.txt|Was society doing enough?
p330_145.txt|The results are sometimes contentious.
p330_146.txt|I never thought it would take this long.
p330_147.txt|He changed my life.
p330_148.txt|There was nothing else to match it.
p330_149.txt|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330_150.txt|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p330_151.txt|They have worked with each other.
p330_152.txt|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p330_153.txt|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330_154.txt|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330_155.txt|His parenthood is called into question.
p330_156.txt|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330_157.txt|But it could have been written for her.
p330_158.txt|His only reply was a laugh.
p330_159.txt|I'm really looking forward to it.
p330_160.txt|A report will be issued by March.
p330_161.txt|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p330_162.txt|The party lasted all night.
p330_163.txt|I was delighted with every one of them.
p330_164.txt|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330_165.txt|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p330_166.txt|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330_167.txt|I was proud of our lads.
p330_168.txt|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p330_169.txt|This is not a Scottish problem.
p330_170.txt|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p330_171.txt|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330_172.txt|After that, we made some changes.
p330_173.txt|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330_174.txt|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330_175.txt|Scotland were beaten again.
p330_176.txt|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p330_177.txt|I have no battle with the Scots.
p330_178.txt|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p330_179.txt|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p330_180.txt|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330_181.txt|She is on a life support machine.
p330_182.txt|The actor has met with Mandela.
p330_183.txt|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330_184.txt|This is a dream come true for me.
p330_185.txt|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p330_186.txt|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p330_187.txt|He went to see what he could learn.
p330_188.txt|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p330_189.txt|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330_190.txt|We're not an employment agency.
p330_191.txt|It has all been positive.
p330_192.txt|Referees are easy targets.
p330_193.txt|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330_194.txt|No government has that right.
p330_195.txt|The luxury has been well used.
p330_196.txt|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330_197.txt|Billie was yet to be born.
p330_198.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p330_199.txt|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p330_200.txt|This is a good result for them.
p330_201.txt|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330_202.txt|There was no time scale.
p330_203.txt|Our message was inclusive.
p330_204.txt|She was right about the struggle.
p330_205.txt|Only the scale of change differed.
p330_206.txt|That was one very hard game.
p330_207.txt|I think the euro has slipped.
p330_208.txt|We began to walk down.
p330_209.txt|I will not take you out of context.
p330_210.txt|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p330_211.txt|The cold war is over.
p330_212.txt|I'd like to take the plunge.
p330_213.txt|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330_214.txt|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p330_215.txt|It had to be more flexible.
p330_216.txt|We are not far from a deal.
p330_217.txt|Are there muscular problems?
p330_218.txt|You remember how long he lasted?
p330_219.txt|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p330_220.txt|Ordering online was very easy.
p330_221.txt|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330_222.txt|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p330_223.txt|I think it is a great idea.
p330_224.txt|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330_225.txt|But it's just great to have won.
p330_226.txt|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p330_227.txt|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p330_228.txt|All these women were actors.
p330_229.txt|I've got no secret.
p330_230.txt|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p330_231.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p330_232.txt|What happened to me last week was wrong.
p330_233.txt|I never made any offer to Mark.
p330_234.txt|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330_235.txt|That is the first thing we need.
p330_236.txt|Will they ever reopen?
p330_237.txt|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330_238.txt|We have great team spirit.
p330_239.txt|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330_240.txt|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330_241.txt|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330_242.txt|You would fall over, he said.
p330_243.txt|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330_244.txt|They should take their mobile phones.
p330_245.txt|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330_246.txt|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330_247.txt|They are also exploited by the markets.
p330_248.txt|The principle is quite clear.
p330_249.txt|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330_250.txt|The board of governors must act.
p330_251.txt|We must all play our part.
p330_252.txt|I first met him last summer.
p330_253.txt|It was to be published next month.
p330_254.txt|That is a break with tradition.
p330_255.txt|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330_256.txt|It could have been a hammering by now.
p330_257.txt|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330_258.txt|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330_259.txt|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p330_260.txt|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330_261.txt|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p330_262.txt|I played really well on the back nine.
p330_263.txt|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p330_264.txt|He will decide tomorrow.
p330_265.txt|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p330_266.txt|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p330_267.txt|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p330_268.txt|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p330_269.txt|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p330_270.txt|That is our main aim.
p330_271.txt|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330_272.txt|I always knew she was funny.
p330_273.txt|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330_274.txt|All kinds of things occur.
p330_275.txt|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p330_276.txt|I expected these kind of questions.
p330_277.txt|The film has also been superbly designed.
p330_278.txt|It was fit for royalty.
p330_279.txt|It is always the same, isn't it?
p330_280.txt|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330_281.txt|I felt really good until Friday.
p330_282.txt|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p330_283.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p330_284.txt|Equity declined to comment.
p330_285.txt|There is precious little middle ground.
p330_286.txt|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p330_287.txt|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p330_288.txt|They were both delightful to work with.
p330_289.txt|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p330_290.txt|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p330_291.txt|It's now down in black and white.
p330_292.txt|Twaddle is a case in point.
p330_293.txt|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330_294.txt|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330_295.txt|There were no formal announcements.
p330_296.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p330_297.txt|That was quite an interesting part.
p330_298.txt|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330_299.txt|Motion described it as a unique event.
p330_300.txt|We have to offer value for money.
p330_301.txt|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p330_302.txt|Chris is big and jolly.
p330_303.txt|It is quite an eye opener.
p330_304.txt|It became a national network.
p330_305.txt|They still have the dirty work to do.
p330_306.txt|I do not want to wait until May.
p330_307.txt|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330_308.txt|We really need research to help with that.
p330_309.txt|We all work for nothing.
p330_310.txt|It is extremely popular with families.
p330_311.txt|He will do very well.
p330_312.txt|It was a cry for help.
p330_313.txt|They also intend to travel today.
p330_314.txt|There's a lot of hysteria.
p330_315.txt|The casualties were not named.
p330_316.txt|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p330_317.txt|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330_318.txt|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330_319.txt|It's just that we see different things.
p330_320.txt|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p330_321.txt|I am very happy with life.
p330_322.txt|We are all family men with children.
p330_323.txt|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330_324.txt|We've had our problems at the club.
p330_325.txt|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p330_326.txt|They were at her bedside when she died.
p330_327.txt|I think we showed that after half time.
p330_328.txt|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p330_329.txt|I am not in denial.
p330_330.txt|There is a solution, she believes.
p330_331.txt|Yet the data is compelling.
p330_332.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p330_333.txt|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330_334.txt|What are you waiting for?
p330_335.txt|It could have been just a quick fix.
p330_336.txt|Will he be given time?
p330_337.txt|You let a lot of people down.
p330_338.txt|It's annoying in a way.
p330_339.txt|The result today is an impasse.
p330_340.txt|It would have to be backdated.
p330_341.txt|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330_342.txt|It is like being a qualifier again.
p330_343.txt|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p330_344.txt|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p330_345.txt|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330_346.txt|She is very upset.
p330_347.txt|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330_348.txt|It was a poor performance.
p330_349.txt|We are very very proud of Alain.
p330_350.txt|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p330_351.txt|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330_352.txt|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p330_353.txt|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330_354.txt|It is patently true.
p330_355.txt|I've got my own ideas.
p330_356.txt|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p330_357.txt|They might want to play.
p330_358.txt|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330_359.txt|Our people should be immune.
p330_360.txt|It is simple and easy to use.
p330_361.txt|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330_362.txt|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p330_363.txt|It is the way they work.
p330_364.txt|This was another video cassette.
p330_365.txt|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p330_366.txt|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p330_367.txt|I think we finished fifth.
p330_368.txt|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330_369.txt|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330_370.txt|I have chosen to do this research.
p330_371.txt|That's the law of the land.
p330_372.txt|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330_373.txt|He scored a touchdown.
p330_374.txt|He wouldn't do it.
p330_375.txt|I don't know exactly what happened.
p330_376.txt|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330_377.txt|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p330_378.txt|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p330_379.txt|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p330_380.txt|Debate is not just talk.
p330_381.txt|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330_382.txt|Neither was involved in violence.
p330_383.txt|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p330_384.txt|So people will come out with these things.
p330_385.txt|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p330_386.txt|I am not a happy man.
p330_387.txt|Was it just negligent.
p330_388.txt|That would open the gates of hell.
p330_389.txt|If only we had known.
p330_390.txt|The line-up is a tasty one.
p330_391.txt|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330_392.txt|She was my big sister.
p330_393.txt|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330_394.txt|They will now get that support.
p330_395.txt|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330_396.txt|Then  all was revealed.
p330_397.txt|They are interior designers and architects.
p330_398.txt|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330_399.txt|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330_400.txt|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p330_401.txt|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330_402.txt|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p330_403.txt|They had given up on him.
p330_404.txt|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p330_405.txt|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p330_406.txt|We will deal with the refugees.
p330_407.txt|I am greatly encouraged.
p330_408.txt|They offer a kind of narrative.
p330_409.txt|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330_410.txt|What does he want him to look like?
p330_411.txt|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p330_412.txt|What is next?
p330_413.txt|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330_414.txt|It's nothing to do with me.
p330_415.txt|She has now been registered as disabled.
p330_416.txt|You have to work with what you've got.
p330_417.txt|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330_418.txt|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330_419.txt|This is about the Orange Order.
p330_420.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p330_421.txt|We will do so again.
p330_422.txt|It's been a long, long journey.
p330_423.txt|I have no problem with that.
p333_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p333_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p333_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p333_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p333_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333_025.txt|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_026.txt|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333_027.txt|But who shot the president?
p333_028.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333_030.txt|All would be under threat.
p333_031.txt|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_032.txt|There are moments of silence.
p333_033.txt|So now this series has had its day.
p333_034.txt|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_035.txt|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p333_036.txt|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p333_037.txt|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p333_038.txt|Too many factors are now working against him.
p333_039.txt|His views are hardly surprising.
p333_040.txt|It is time for a new approach.
p333_041.txt|We have nothing to say about that.
p333_042.txt|We've tried every other way.
p333_043.txt|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p333_044.txt|Nobody else was with me.
p333_045.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p333_046.txt|It does make a big difference.
p333_047.txt|Do not forget about Monaco.
p333_048.txt|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333_049.txt|You can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050.txt|Everything was an effort.
p333_051.txt|And does it even matter?
p333_052.txt|This is the same old story.
p333_053.txt|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054.txt|My parents are exhausted.
p333_055.txt|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p333_056.txt|The performance was excellent.
p333_057.txt|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p333_058.txt|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p333_059.txt|It will come up here.
p333_060.txt|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p333_061.txt|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062.txt|The chief constable is right.
p333_063.txt|I didn't expect to get one.
p333_064.txt|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065.txt|This is only the start of my season.
p333_066.txt|It sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067.txt|I've taken to the hills.
p333_068.txt|John was a very nice man.
p333_069.txt|This is a big, big win.
p333_070.txt|The crowd was awesome.
p333_071.txt|Every game against New Zealand is.
p333_072.txt|The jury is still out on this one.
p333_073.txt|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074.txt|That would have killed the match.
p333_075.txt|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p333_076.txt|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077.txt|They had not been handcuffed.
p333_078.txt|I think we will join the single currency.
p333_079.txt|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080.txt|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081.txt|They wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082.txt|It runs until the beginning of June.
p333_083.txt|All of us do.
p333_084.txt|But will they fall in love?
p333_085.txt|It was different from our other work.
p333_086.txt|That is in the public domain.
p333_087.txt|The Hague is too good for him.
p333_088.txt|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p333_089.txt|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p333_090.txt|It's a true story.
p333_091.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p333_092.txt|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p333_093.txt|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333_094.txt|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p333_095.txt|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p333_096.txt|He could face a jail sentence.
p333_097.txt|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_098.txt|There was no option.
p333_099.txt|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333_100.txt|Could they perhaps be related?
p333_101.txt|Happily we found it in the library.
p333_102.txt|We all thought we were going to die.
p333_103.txt|Maybe he will act again.
p333_104.txt|Safety was also an issue.
p333_105.txt|That's why he visited.
p333_106.txt|I know a lot of people who don't.
p333_107.txt|There was nobody on the roof.
p333_108.txt|Clark is back on top form.
p333_109.txt|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p333_110.txt|It needs somebody to give way.
p333_111.txt|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333_112.txt|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_113.txt|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_114.txt|The days of empty promises are over.
p333_115.txt|I thought he was terrific.
p333_116.txt|Henry was strong and talented.
p333_117.txt|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_118.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_119.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p333_120.txt|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p333_121.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_122.txt|A venue was found.
p333_123.txt|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p333_124.txt|He said it was the worst possible result.
p333_125.txt|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333_126.txt|This is our way to make our point.
p333_127.txt|It was a disaster.
p333_128.txt|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p333_129.txt|He was back to square one.
p333_130.txt|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333_131.txt|I have been coming here for nine years.
p333_132.txt|It is just part of modern day life.
p333_133.txt|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333_134.txt|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333_135.txt|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_136.txt|YOU thought it was a headache.
p333_137.txt|All the people thought that he would die.
p333_138.txt|It is never an easy game.
p333_139.txt|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_140.txt|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_141.txt|The post will run for four years.
p333_142.txt|However, it's good to turn the page.
p333_143.txt|He had reason to be pleased.
p333_144.txt|It was important to win the singles.
p333_145.txt|That is impressive by any standards.
p333_146.txt|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_147.txt|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333_148.txt|That alibi is now gone.
p333_149.txt|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_150.txt|The Scots are great.
p333_151.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p333_152.txt|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p333_153.txt|I will certainly be having words with him.
p333_154.txt|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_155.txt|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p333_156.txt|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_157.txt|But he is not using them.
p333_158.txt|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333_159.txt|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_160.txt|We are not moving in.
p333_161.txt|It was a breathtaking moment.
p333_162.txt|That's been our position all along.
p333_163.txt|I was in jail for five years.
p333_164.txt|There are no charges.
p333_165.txt|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_166.txt|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_167.txt|I am very, very happy.
p333_168.txt|They got the job done.
p333_169.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p333_170.txt|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333_171.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p333_172.txt|It's going to be epic.
p333_173.txt|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333_174.txt|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_175.txt|He just carried on filming.
p333_176.txt|He will be judged by his actions.
p333_177.txt|I never found my rhythm.
p333_178.txt|I didn't mean to kill her.
p333_179.txt|It is a job creation scheme.
p333_180.txt|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p333_181.txt|We might be back next year.
p333_182.txt|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_183.txt|The same goes for personnel.
p333_184.txt|In a way he was.
p333_185.txt|This area is perfect for children.
p333_186.txt|No, they have not.
p333_187.txt|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_188.txt|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p333_189.txt|I was chosen to do this.
p333_190.txt|The weekly average was three hours.
p333_191.txt|When he took over it really took off.
p333_192.txt|I have been very nervous.
p333_193.txt|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_194.txt|There was an element of jealousy.
p333_195.txt|There was no happy ending.
p333_196.txt|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_197.txt|I didn't play well last year.
p333_198.txt|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p333_199.txt|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_200.txt|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_201.txt|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_202.txt|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_203.txt|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333_204.txt|It is legally binding.
p333_205.txt|It has come as a bombshell.
p333_206.txt|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_207.txt|We didn't know he was even out.
p333_208.txt|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_209.txt|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_210.txt|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p333_211.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p333_212.txt|We still don't know.
p333_213.txt|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_215.txt|This is a foolish idea.
p333_216.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p333_217.txt|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_218.txt|Or some thought that they have.
p333_219.txt|If only we had known.
p333_220.txt|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_221.txt|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333_222.txt|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_223.txt|Two and a half million people have died.
p333_224.txt|It could not be too high.
p333_225.txt|How many cases have there been?
p333_226.txt|I hope they understand that.
p333_227.txt|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p333_228.txt|But Annika is just amazing.
p333_229.txt|Our job is to change that.
p333_230.txt|She will also get a pay rise.
p333_231.txt|It's because they can't understand the language.
p333_232.txt|It is time for a more honest approach.
p333_233.txt|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p333_234.txt|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p333_235.txt|What's it all about?
p333_236.txt|It is a big time for me.
p333_237.txt|There were two things going on at once.
p333_238.txt|It's something we want to make work.
p333_239.txt|I want to play at the highest level.
p333_240.txt|We are all equal.
p333_241.txt|That is the key message.
p333_242.txt|It ignores the future.
p333_243.txt|This is the subway.
p333_244.txt|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_245.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_246.txt|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_247.txt|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_248.txt|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p333_249.txt|He's in with the furniture.
p333_250.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p333_251.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333_252.txt|Who will provide the wine?
p333_253.txt|We are still getting signals.
p333_254.txt|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p333_255.txt|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333_256.txt|We started from scratch.
p333_257.txt|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_258.txt|There are a few changes.
p333_259.txt|You're not going to get hurt.
p333_260.txt|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_261.txt|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333_262.txt|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_263.txt|I heard some of his remarks.
p333_264.txt|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_265.txt|It has to be funded.
p333_266.txt|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333_267.txt|I was just overwhelmed.
p333_268.txt|It had been in place since last July.
p333_269.txt|It was very frightened and dirty.
p333_270.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333_271.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p333_272.txt|That's a very strong element.
p333_273.txt|How much of a cop out is that?
p333_274.txt|The whole region is in shock.
p333_275.txt|It was a journey into a new life.
p333_276.txt|It's a way of making a mark.
p333_277.txt|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_278.txt|You were the kidnappers.
p333_279.txt|It is a very interesting subject.
p333_280.txt|We know we can't rely on you.
p333_281.txt|Arguably, they have already done it.
p333_282.txt|It was indeed a night to remember.
p333_283.txt|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_284.txt|There is something in this.
p333_285.txt|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_286.txt|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333_287.txt|There are no plans to change this.
p333_288.txt|It's too big a risk to take.
p333_289.txt|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_290.txt|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333_291.txt|It is just too long since the war.
p333_292.txt|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_293.txt|Debbie Harry was cool.
p333_294.txt|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_295.txt|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333_296.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p333_297.txt|And sooner than we may think.
p333_298.txt|Raised the way you want it.
p333_299.txt|However, consumers may take a different view.
p333_300.txt|I know you went back this morning.
p333_301.txt|I will carry on.
p333_302.txt|A review of the decision is being sought.
p333_303.txt|I made a mistake.
p333_304.txt|It is a very special city.
p333_305.txt|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_306.txt|They certainly do not socialise.
p333_307.txt|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_308.txt|I think that could work to our advantage.
p333_309.txt|Was that not awful?
p333_310.txt|That was him under pressure.
p333_311.txt|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_312.txt|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_313.txt|I'm not blaming audiences.
p333_315.txt|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_316.txt|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p333_317.txt|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p333_318.txt|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333_319.txt|I was doing well at the hustings.
p333_320.txt|We will just get on with it.
p333_321.txt|We are worried about casualties.
p333_322.txt|This is my music.
p333_323.txt|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_324.txt|I haven't won the world title.
p333_325.txt|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p333_326.txt|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_327.txt|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_328.txt|And now he tells us.
p333_329.txt|I am not changing my event.
p333_330.txt|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_331.txt|This Patton will also return.
p333_332.txt|That is as it may be.
p333_333.txt|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p333_334.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p333_335.txt|Eleven events are required.
p333_336.txt|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333_337.txt|You encourage them - you can do it.
p333_338.txt|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_339.txt|I always said No.
p333_340.txt|The stadium was full.
p333_341.txt|Cinema is a communal experience.
p333_342.txt|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333_343.txt|He was different from the rest of us.
p333_344.txt|His name is Michael Owen.
p333_345.txt|He's got a great chance of making it.
p333_346.txt|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_347.txt|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p333_348.txt|So now you know.
p333_349.txt|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p333_350.txt|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_351.txt|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_352.txt|The feeling is awesome.
p333_353.txt|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p333_354.txt|Smith has not let him down.
p333_355.txt|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_356.txt|Which he can do.
p333_357.txt|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p333_358.txt|It has been recorded twice.
p333_359.txt|They were that poor.
p333_360.txt|And we're talking Big Money.
p333_361.txt|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_362.txt|They have two children.
p333_363.txt|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p333_364.txt|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_365.txt|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_366.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p333_367.txt|There was a great support all round the route.
p333_368.txt|They should feel ashamed.
p333_369.txt|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_370.txt|Both managements are very supportive.
p333_371.txt|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p333_372.txt|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_373.txt|This is important for two reasons.
p333_374.txt|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_375.txt|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_376.txt|You will not feel a thing.
p333_377.txt|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333_378.txt|It's not just for classical music.
p333_379.txt|This must be kept in total perspective.
p333_380.txt|All of the names are familiar to me.
p333_381.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p333_382.txt|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p333_383.txt|Is that where we are?
p333_384.txt|We used to keep our business rates.
p333_385.txt|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p333_386.txt|But there's no eye contact.
p333_387.txt|There was no energy behind it.
p333_388.txt|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p333_389.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_390.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p333_391.txt|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_392.txt|It is not a wish list.
p333_393.txt|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333_394.txt|If not, he should go home.
p333_395.txt|There is no margin for error.
p333_396.txt|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p333_397.txt|I get very excited by that.
p333_398.txt|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333_399.txt|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p333_400.txt|Which means it matters.
p333_401.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p333_402.txt|There is a great potential on this river.
p333_403.txt|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p333_404.txt|She said he showed no remorse.
p333_405.txt|They hold on for many years.
p333_406.txt|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p333_407.txt|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333_408.txt|There's nothing for you here.
p333_409.txt|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333_410.txt|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_411.txt|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p333_412.txt|I have not come in to take over.
p333_413.txt|Is this accurate?
p333_414.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p333_415.txt|I want to win this thing.
p333_416.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p333_417.txt|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p333_418.txt|I'd just like to play.
p333_419.txt|They were in good humour, too.
p333_420.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p333_421.txt|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333_422.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333_423.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p333_424.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p334_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p334_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p334_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p334_025.txt|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_026.txt|I want to win this thing.
p334_027.txt|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p334_028.txt|I'd just like to play.
p334_029.txt|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p334_030.txt|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p334_031.txt|It was no surprise.
p334_032.txt|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_033.txt|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_034.txt|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_035.txt|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_036.txt|We could feel the heat.
p334_037.txt|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334_038.txt|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_039.txt|I think it can count against you now.
p334_040.txt|I wanted to win so badly.
p334_041.txt|It was an accounting error.
p334_042.txt|I had enough on.
p334_043.txt|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044.txt|There were no passengers on board.
p334_045.txt|And we're not there yet.
p334_046.txt|No meaningful response was issued.
p334_047.txt|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p334_048.txt|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p334_049.txt|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334_050.txt|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051.txt|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052.txt|It is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053.txt|plays in dark blue.
p334_054.txt|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p334_055.txt|It is something that we will put right.
p334_056.txt|Why do it?
p334_057.txt|It could take three days.
p334_058.txt|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p334_059.txt|It was totally my fault.
p334_060.txt|Or so everyone believed.
p334_061.txt|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p334_062.txt|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063.txt|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064.txt|He's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066.txt|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067.txt|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_068.txt|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069.txt|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070.txt|He will need that machine.
p334_071.txt|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p334_072.txt|We are looking for volunteers.
p334_073.txt|I had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074.txt|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075.txt|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076.txt|I was inspired by two things.
p334_077.txt|They follow him everywhere.
p334_078.txt|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079.txt|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080.txt|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081.txt|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082.txt|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p334_083.txt|This must be really short of ideas.
p334_084.txt|It was extremely cold.
p334_085.txt|They use them for everything.
p334_086.txt|We have the easy part.
p334_087.txt|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p334_088.txt|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334_089.txt|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_090.txt|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334_091.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p334_092.txt|We already have them, all over Europe.
p334_093.txt|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_094.txt|Libya is an easy target.
p334_095.txt|I thought they played very well.
p334_096.txt|It was a foolhardy decision.
p334_097.txt|It means they actually control the programme.
p334_098.txt|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p334_099.txt|They chose to side with terror.
p334_100.txt|Justice was not seen today.
p334_101.txt|I would never even consider it.
p334_102.txt|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334_103.txt|We should just say no.
p334_104.txt|We are not out of touch with politics.
p334_105.txt|That was a gold medal for certain.
p334_106.txt|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p334_107.txt|I didn't make those adjustments.
p334_108.txt|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_109.txt|We have it on video.
p334_110.txt|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334_111.txt|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334_112.txt|It didn't take long.
p334_113.txt|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_114.txt|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p334_115.txt|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334_116.txt|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p334_117.txt|He told the conference.
p334_118.txt|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_119.txt|We tend to come good at the end.
p334_120.txt|He also received a medal of honour.
p334_121.txt|It's not one for the purist.
p334_122.txt|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_123.txt|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p334_124.txt|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334_125.txt|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_126.txt|It is a time bomb.
p334_127.txt|It's a matter of huge concern.
p334_128.txt|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_129.txt|We are taking advice on this.
p334_130.txt|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_131.txt|It was just an accident of birth.
p334_132.txt|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334_133.txt|It was a simple question.
p334_134.txt|Some of his family still live there.
p334_135.txt|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p334_136.txt|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p334_137.txt|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p334_138.txt|Could you put it in writing?
p334_139.txt|This is the New Edinburgh.
p334_140.txt|We all thought we were going to die.
p334_141.txt|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_142.txt|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334_143.txt|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_144.txt|The world is split into two.
p334_145.txt|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_146.txt|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_147.txt|It was so physical.
p334_148.txt|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_149.txt|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p334_150.txt|Why is that?
p334_151.txt|It is extremely sad.
p334_153.txt|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_154.txt|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334_155.txt|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_156.txt|He was not deterred.
p334_157.txt|This commitment should be built upon.
p334_158.txt|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p334_159.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334_160.txt|That is not just my personal view.
p334_161.txt|The investment will be in the food.
p334_162.txt|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p334_163.txt|The problem is the pitch.
p334_164.txt|That's as it should be.
p334_165.txt|It does seem a mystery.
p334_166.txt|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p334_167.txt|He looked very sharp.
p334_168.txt|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_169.txt|Two of the team became ill.
p334_170.txt|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_171.txt|I see no need for change.
p334_172.txt|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_173.txt|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334_174.txt|Do yourselves a favour.
p334_175.txt|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334_176.txt|But we have come under attack.
p334_177.txt|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_178.txt|What do they do, anyway?
p334_179.txt|He was just like a godfather to it.
p334_180.txt|I'd love to be like Peter.
p334_181.txt|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_182.txt|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_183.txt|That is his attitude to things.
p334_184.txt|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_185.txt|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334_186.txt|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_187.txt|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_188.txt|No finals are to be contested today.
p334_189.txt|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334_190.txt|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_191.txt|His English counterpart agreed.
p334_192.txt|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_193.txt|It is in our own hands.
p334_194.txt|This is a step backwards.
p334_195.txt|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_196.txt|He will address the nation this evening.
p334_197.txt|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334_198.txt|I'm not changing my mind.
p334_199.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334_200.txt|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_201.txt|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_202.txt|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_203.txt|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334_204.txt|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_205.txt|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_206.txt|We'll have to work hard today.
p334_207.txt|The frustration was showing.
p334_208.txt|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334_209.txt|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334_210.txt|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_211.txt|My friends were very envious.
p334_212.txt|But who cares?
p334_213.txt|The house was full of smoke.
p334_214.txt|The approval system will be changed.
p334_215.txt|So the European elections are extremely important.
p334_216.txt|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334_217.txt|That period was a struggle.
p334_218.txt|We are determined to establish the facts.
p334_219.txt|You just have to accept.
p334_220.txt|We must improve our relations with government.
p334_221.txt|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p334_222.txt|The list is too long for this piece.
p334_223.txt|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334_224.txt|I can't blame the fans.
p334_225.txt|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_226.txt|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p334_227.txt|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_228.txt|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_229.txt|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334_230.txt|So far they have refused.
p334_231.txt|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_232.txt|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p334_233.txt|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334_234.txt|He took my breath away.
p334_235.txt|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334_236.txt|I will have to order its destruction.
p334_237.txt|After that it is up to the boss.
p334_238.txt|I never wanted a legal battle.
p334_239.txt|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334_240.txt|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_241.txt|It had won an investors in people award.
p334_242.txt|A venue was found.
p334_243.txt|They are not an item.
p334_244.txt|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334_245.txt|Is that Titanic?
p334_246.txt|He was to get his chance.
p334_247.txt|So, the question is, is it any good?
p334_248.txt|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_249.txt|That's why they go to the opera.
p334_250.txt|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p334_251.txt|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_252.txt|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334_253.txt|I'm getting back up there now.
p334_254.txt|Check that he is dead.
p334_255.txt|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_256.txt|My players have no idea about football.
p334_257.txt|They are there to get people into work.
p334_258.txt|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334_259.txt|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_260.txt|They would be wise to do just that.
p334_261.txt|He was sentenced to seven years.
p334_262.txt|That, he claimed, was essential.
p334_263.txt|I would like Glasgow.
p334_264.txt|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334_265.txt|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_266.txt|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_267.txt|The weaknesses are few.
p334_268.txt|I may think about performing it.
p334_269.txt|I would recommend it.
p334_270.txt|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p334_271.txt|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334_272.txt|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334_273.txt|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334_274.txt|You can't go back and change things.
p334_275.txt|We are on a four-year mission.
p334_276.txt|This is a lie.
p334_277.txt|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334_278.txt|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p334_279.txt|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_280.txt|They should stop the bombing.
p334_281.txt|They'll have to pay more.
p334_282.txt|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_283.txt|Does it, Noel?
p334_284.txt|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_285.txt|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334_286.txt|The Open champion is back.
p334_287.txt|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_288.txt|It's the taking part that counts.
p334_289.txt|They married in August last year.
p334_290.txt|I want to keep him.
p334_291.txt|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_292.txt|You've been a great audience.
p334_293.txt|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_294.txt|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p334_295.txt|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_296.txt|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334_297.txt|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_298.txt|People are fed up.
p334_299.txt|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_300.txt|It's a sign of the times.
p334_301.txt|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_302.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p334_303.txt|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334_304.txt|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_305.txt|He is a Satan.
p334_306.txt|I always felt they played for me.
p334_307.txt|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334_308.txt|They must be kept on the ground.
p334_309.txt|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334_310.txt|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334_311.txt|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_312.txt|The public have been very supportive.
p334_313.txt|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p334_314.txt|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p334_315.txt|The hotel was now for sale.
p334_316.txt|There are two games to go after that.
p334_317.txt|It seems a little short to me.
p334_318.txt|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p334_319.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p334_320.txt|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p334_321.txt|I welcome this new service.
p334_322.txt|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_323.txt|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_324.txt|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334_325.txt|It was a UK-wide report.
p334_326.txt|The law should be changed.
p334_327.txt|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_328.txt|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334_329.txt|I will be standing.
p334_330.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334_331.txt|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_332.txt|Are you from the rugby?
p334_333.txt|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_334.txt|The plot is simple.
p334_335.txt|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_336.txt|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_337.txt|With actors it is slightly different.
p334_338.txt|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334_339.txt|Last night was a key episode.
p334_340.txt|What did we learn?
p334_341.txt|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_342.txt|I knew he was dying.
p334_343.txt|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_344.txt|He loved his children.
p334_345.txt|She wondered why we were interested.
p334_346.txt|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_347.txt|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_348.txt|I am content with the silver.
p334_349.txt|People acted too quickly.
p334_350.txt|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334_351.txt|We took the chances when they came.
p334_352.txt|You have to audition for jobs.
p334_353.txt|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_354.txt|Ferguson should take note.
p334_355.txt|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334_356.txt|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_357.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_358.txt|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334_359.txt|It gave no further details.
p334_360.txt|This man is serious about his work.
p334_361.txt|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p334_362.txt|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_363.txt|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334_364.txt|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_365.txt|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334_366.txt|We will miss him very much.
p334_367.txt|This was a chilling echo.
p334_368.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334_369.txt|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_370.txt|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p334_371.txt|January is a bad time of year.
p334_372.txt|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334_373.txt|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_374.txt|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_375.txt|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_376.txt|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_377.txt|His third goal was superb.
p334_378.txt|Here we have not had one hour.
p334_379.txt|He said to me, Which one, son?
p334_380.txt|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_381.txt|His son is a local legend.
p334_382.txt|I was so nervous.
p334_383.txt|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_384.txt|His death was a tragic accident.
p334_385.txt|It's to do with context.
p334_386.txt|This fight is not going to go away.
p334_387.txt|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334_388.txt|I just don't know where he is.
p334_389.txt|Would you take them?
p334_390.txt|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_391.txt|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_392.txt|He would take up the bike.
p334_393.txt|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p334_394.txt|He sat down at the piano.
p334_395.txt|His condition was stable last night.
p334_396.txt|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_397.txt|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_398.txt|I'm sure they love it.
p334_399.txt|I'd never seen a play about me.
p334_400.txt|The track is currently covered in snow.
p334_401.txt|And they all had these other commitments.
p334_402.txt|The report is due out next month.
p334_403.txt|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334_404.txt|We are going to change our party.
p334_405.txt|It's the same as Glasgow.
p334_406.txt|This seems like a very good idea.
p334_407.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p334_408.txt|It remains in public ownership.
p334_409.txt|The Master was by then just too old.
p334_410.txt|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334_411.txt|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334_412.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p334_413.txt|The hangover was Olympian.
p334_414.txt|We are here for the long term.
p334_415.txt|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p334_416.txt|A great deal has been achieved.
p334_417.txt|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334_418.txt|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p334_419.txt|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334_420.txt|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334_421.txt|I think it is totally wrong.
p334_422.txt|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334_423.txt|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p334_424.txt|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p339_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p339_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_018.txt|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p339_025.txt|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_026.txt|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_027.txt|Glasgow is far from overload.
p339_028.txt|It's a big mystery.
p339_029.txt|What is a house without it?
p339_030.txt|It was really good in the first week.
p339_031.txt|It's about the balance.
p339_032.txt|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339_033.txt|It really has not been their season.
p339_034.txt|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_035.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_036.txt|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_037.txt|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_038.txt|You go in there and do it.
p339_039.txt|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339_040.txt|What will happen to them today?
p339_041.txt|I didn't expect to get one.
p339_042.txt|It was electric, amazing.
p339_043.txt|I said to him.
p339_044.txt|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045.txt|he told a producer.
p339_046.txt|That is not the place for her.
p339_047.txt|The jury is still out on this one.
p339_048.txt|We have to work together.
p339_049.txt|I don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050.txt|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p339_051.txt|It means it is difficult.
p339_052.txt|But they were true stories.
p339_053.txt|I needed to get away.
p339_054.txt|I will make that point tonight.
p339_055.txt|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056.txt|There are two things we have to do.
p339_057.txt|Are they going to work together again?
p339_058.txt|We need to do that every week.
p339_059.txt|It gives us something to work on.
p339_060.txt|But what did it matter?
p339_061.txt|A government is a government is a government.
p339_062.txt|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063.txt|I am not retaining him.
p339_064.txt|The police are not the target.
p339_065.txt|It has affected it, obviously.
p339_066.txt|But that title is a mistake.
p339_067.txt|And he's not a bigot.
p339_068.txt|But summer is spent.
p339_069.txt|Services are being expanded, too.
p339_070.txt|It has only been rumours.
p339_071.txt|It is extremely fortunate.
p339_072.txt|Today is the first step in that process.
p339_073.txt|Several others were absent.
p339_074.txt|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075.txt|But there was no time for that.
p339_076.txt|A review is under way.
p339_077.txt|That should be fun.
p339_078.txt|Maybe he will act again.
p339_079.txt|What we were doing.
p339_080.txt|What is the Barnett formula?
p339_081.txt|It all happened so suddenly.
p339_082.txt|I won't let that happen.
p339_083.txt|Or have they?
p339_084.txt|There is no change in the strategy.
p339_085.txt|I had a fortunate war.
p339_086.txt|It will probably be my last, too.
p339_087.txt|I am not completely insane.
p339_088.txt|We spoke about a few people.
p339_089.txt|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_090.txt|In fact, he took it very well.
p339_091.txt|I decided to take my time.
p339_092.txt|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339_093.txt|We did it in one take.
p339_094.txt|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_095.txt|It is hard to understand.
p339_096.txt|What will it be?
p339_097.txt|The search is due to be completed today.
p339_098.txt|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_099.txt|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339_100.txt|He is a one-off.
p339_101.txt|Six men will take the decision.
p339_102.txt|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_103.txt|We should not be surprised at that.
p339_104.txt|It was a disaster.
p339_105.txt|We have been so lucky.
p339_107.txt|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_108.txt|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_109.txt|It was all over now.
p339_110.txt|But it was only a matter of time.
p339_111.txt|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_112.txt|I still hope to go.
p339_113.txt|Sometimes they come off.
p339_114.txt|We're not that bad.
p339_115.txt|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_116.txt|I feel strongly about it.
p339_117.txt|There are exciting days ahead.
p339_118.txt|We have to put this behind us.
p339_119.txt|I thought it was quite good.
p339_120.txt|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_121.txt|We're very, very happy.
p339_122.txt|There could be a possible connection.
p339_123.txt|But there was everything!
p339_124.txt|We are doing very well as we are.
p339_125.txt|The Scots are great.
p339_126.txt|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_127.txt|However, the drama was not over.
p339_128.txt|But it was not just the land.
p339_129.txt|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_130.txt|It is too much for me.
p339_131.txt|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_132.txt|We are still waiting.
p339_133.txt|It happened again yesterday.
p339_134.txt|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_135.txt|That question was never asked.
p339_136.txt|I am not inclined to believe it.
p339_137.txt|It was on fire.
p339_138.txt|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_139.txt|How can they tell?
p339_140.txt|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_141.txt|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_142.txt|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_143.txt|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339_144.txt|He was part of the family.
p339_145.txt|I certainly think it should be there.
p339_146.txt|But it does not matter.
p339_147.txt|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_148.txt|Sadly, he has a point.
p339_149.txt|It was so sad.
p339_150.txt|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339_151.txt|We were extremely lucky.
p339_152.txt|It was an amazing time.
p339_153.txt|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339_154.txt|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_155.txt|It is just a matter of time.
p339_156.txt|This news is really depressing.
p339_157.txt|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_158.txt|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339_159.txt|The enemy was time.
p339_160.txt|He would have done the same to me.
p339_161.txt|What were they told?
p339_162.txt|More cases are expected.
p339_163.txt|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_164.txt|It would be very dangerous.
p339_165.txt|How can they say that?
p339_166.txt|My condition is not bad.
p339_167.txt|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_168.txt|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339_169.txt|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_170.txt|The goal is clear.
p339_171.txt|Just think about the lines.
p339_172.txt|It all depends on the wind.
p339_173.txt|I was very influenced by him.
p339_174.txt|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_175.txt|This was much worse.
p339_176.txt|This was certainly not about money.
p339_177.txt|It is simple, but profound.
p339_178.txt|The funding is now there.
p339_179.txt|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_180.txt|A film is different from a book.
p339_181.txt|Within three days he was dead.
p339_182.txt|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_183.txt|Did they give any good advice?
p339_184.txt|We know that from recent experience.
p339_185.txt|From day one, we were a family.
p339_186.txt|It separates the men from the boys.
p339_187.txt|This could be wonderful.
p339_188.txt|He loved it, and so did they.
p339_189.txt|The other was a football match.
p339_190.txt|They have the players to do it.
p339_191.txt|Which is worse?
p339_192.txt|He has made a step forward.
p339_193.txt|That was very important.
p339_194.txt|This will have to change.
p339_195.txt|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p339_196.txt|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_197.txt|We are going to have a party.
p339_198.txt|I have no problem with that.
p339_199.txt|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_200.txt|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_201.txt|We're all paying for it.
p339_202.txt|Lester was like that.
p339_203.txt|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339_204.txt|That's a matter for them.
p339_205.txt|We were never told it was already decided.
p339_206.txt|It is part of our heritage.
p339_207.txt|It is not a road of life.
p339_208.txt|It is not as simple as that.
p339_209.txt|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_210.txt|Find them somebody they deserve.
p339_211.txt|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_212.txt|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339_213.txt|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_214.txt|We're not getting involved.
p339_215.txt|The lottery has helped.
p339_216.txt|They know the language.
p339_217.txt|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_218.txt|We shall be victorious.
p339_219.txt|The quality of work is very impressive.
p339_220.txt|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339_221.txt|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_222.txt|We will all suffer as a result.
p339_223.txt|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339_224.txt|What's it about?
p339_225.txt|We are looking to the future.
p339_226.txt|The signs are positive.
p339_227.txt|I called it right.
p339_228.txt|I see it as my job.
p339_229.txt|I have always believed in myself.
p339_230.txt|It has to be put in context.
p339_231.txt|I think we can get there.
p339_232.txt|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_233.txt|No, they have played well.
p339_234.txt|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_235.txt|The answer is obviously no.
p339_236.txt|I'll take it as it comes.
p339_237.txt|I think we're the better side.
p339_238.txt|We act because we must.
p339_239.txt|There are two mysteries.
p339_240.txt|The teacher would have approved.
p339_241.txt|Are you going to win?
p339_242.txt|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_243.txt|I could have been killed on that day.
p339_244.txt|They have to come up with a solution.
p339_245.txt|It is very enjoyable.
p339_246.txt|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339_247.txt|Did it work?
p339_248.txt|But that is for another day.
p339_249.txt|There is a great carry over value.
p339_250.txt|It was not like that at all.
p339_251.txt|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_252.txt|I was very surprised.
p339_253.txt|We all knew they could do it.
p339_254.txt|It's about taking risks.
p339_255.txt|Why is this?
p339_256.txt|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_257.txt|It was indeed a night to remember.
p339_258.txt|There are not too many like him.
p339_259.txt|The memory is there.
p339_260.txt|It was an amazing experience.
p339_261.txt|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_262.txt|He will go on the bench.
p339_263.txt|The police are hopeless.
p339_264.txt|There are no plans to change this.
p339_265.txt|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_266.txt|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_267.txt|That's the important thing.
p339_268.txt|Should he resign?
p339_269.txt|They have to live with the risk.
p339_270.txt|It is, but that's not the point.
p339_271.txt|It was my whole life.
p339_272.txt|It was a classic.
p339_273.txt|This week is a perfect example.
p339_274.txt|However, it is going to happen.
p339_275.txt|This time it really could happen.
p339_276.txt|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_277.txt|That includes the equipment?
p339_278.txt|It does nothing for me.
p339_279.txt|That has been lost.
p339_280.txt|But that's another story.
p339_281.txt|I think it has worked.
p339_282.txt|No other family members could be contacted.
p339_283.txt|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_284.txt|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_285.txt|But do not rely on it.
p339_286.txt|I made a mistake.
p339_287.txt|What do you want.
p339_288.txt|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_289.txt|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_290.txt|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339_291.txt|Was that not awful?
p339_292.txt|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_293.txt|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_294.txt|But it will not work again.
p339_295.txt|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_296.txt|I have nothing to say on that.
p339_297.txt|The rest is his own.
p339_298.txt|I have no worry about that.
p339_299.txt|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339_300.txt|Who was on the panel?
p339_301.txt|It turned out to have been three hours.
p339_302.txt|That is exactly right.
p339_303.txt|That is not good for golf!
p339_304.txt|He had planned to sell it.
p339_305.txt|We know the goals will come.
p339_306.txt|But it did not last.
p339_307.txt|They need to look after themselves.
p339_308.txt|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339_309.txt|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_310.txt|We have nothing to lose.
p339_311.txt|The first time it was rejected.
p339_312.txt|He did not report it.
p339_313.txt|No-one can take it in.
p339_314.txt|They were following his orders.
p339_315.txt|That is an entirely different discipline.
p339_316.txt|It was an insult.
p339_317.txt|Yet there is hope.
p339_318.txt|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_319.txt|It will not be easy for him.
p339_320.txt|That was a fairy tale.
p339_321.txt|I would love to do that.
p339_322.txt|You'll have to wait and see.
p339_323.txt|It wasn't the issue.
p339_324.txt|The number never came.
p339_325.txt|I really have to go now.
p339_326.txt|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_327.txt|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339_328.txt|Words are not enough.
p339_329.txt|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_330.txt|We have expected it.
p339_331.txt|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339_332.txt|Well, that was the plan.
p339_333.txt|The problem is fairly serious.
p339_334.txt|No decisions have been taken.
p339_335.txt|We won't do that.
p339_336.txt|It's the body that counts.
p339_337.txt|Sprinters are not fit.
p339_338.txt|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_339.txt|It's a double whammy.
p339_340.txt|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_341.txt|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_342.txt|That's why he is the prime minister.
p339_343.txt|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_344.txt|They have to be dealt with.
p339_345.txt|His manager blamed the referee.
p339_346.txt|So what was he really doing?
p339_347.txt|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_348.txt|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_349.txt|We're very close to being a good team.
p339_350.txt|I thought their commitment was superb.
p339_351.txt|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_352.txt|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_353.txt|I had nothing to lose.
p339_354.txt|This is a really serious issue.
p339_355.txt|I thought to myself.
p339_356.txt|Could it be?
p339_357.txt|We're talking to the US.
p339_358.txt|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_359.txt|It looks as though there is no chance.
p339_360.txt|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_361.txt|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_362.txt|I cannot really commit.
p339_363.txt|There are many questions to be answered.
p339_364.txt|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339_365.txt|This is a new beginning.
p339_366.txt|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339_367.txt|They will fight for everything.
p339_368.txt|He is doing just that.
p339_369.txt|The night is young.
p339_370.txt|But there are signs of a revival.
p339_371.txt|I thought it was a great game.
p339_372.txt|Just get on with it.
p339_373.txt|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_374.txt|It shows the Government is listening.
p339_375.txt|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_376.txt|They want it to work.
p339_377.txt|This is a completely new experience for me.
p339_378.txt|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_379.txt|It decided to blame the media.
p339_380.txt|We have chosen for the patients.
p339_381.txt|He was at the outset of his career.
p339_382.txt|Our position is quite clear.
p339_383.txt|It could now be up to the courts.
p339_384.txt|We can make a difference.
p339_385.txt|This was not a contest.
p339_386.txt|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_387.txt|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_388.txt|I cannot describe it.
p339_389.txt|It is not designed to kill.
p339_390.txt|He has run a hell of a race.
p339_391.txt|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_392.txt|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_393.txt|It is good football in Scotland.
p339_394.txt|There is no other option.
p339_395.txt|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_396.txt|It is a technique.
p339_397.txt|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_398.txt|My body is exhausted.
p339_399.txt|It is about more than Scotland.
p339_400.txt|It's not just going to be busy.
p339_401.txt|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_402.txt|The first appeared to be successful.
p339_403.txt|She was so supportive.
p339_404.txt|I'm delighted with our performance.
p339_405.txt|We await a decision.
p339_406.txt|It's a matter of balance.
p339_407.txt|It is an investment in our product.
p339_408.txt|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_409.txt|What would you ask?
p339_410.txt|We have got to deal with it.
p339_411.txt|Where do we spend it?
p339_412.txt|I don't know how she does it.
p339_413.txt|I saw it later in the news.
p339_414.txt|Now we must look to the future.
p339_415.txt|I didn't play badly.
p339_416.txt|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_417.txt|They are looking for partners.
p339_418.txt|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_419.txt|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_420.txt|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_421.txt|He did very well, but didn't win.
p339_422.txt|There is no shortage of questions.
p339_423.txt|Couldn't see the point.
p339_424.txt|Which, in effect, it is.
p341_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p341_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p341_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p341_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p341_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p341_025.txt|This guy is never going to give up.
p341_026.txt|That's interesting to me.
p341_027.txt|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_028.txt|It is only one night, after all.
p341_029.txt|The injuries are not too serious.
p341_030.txt|Gilbert was not amused.
p341_031.txt|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341_032.txt|It has moved on in the last week.
p341_033.txt|Everything was up for grabs.
p341_034.txt|It's easy to see why.
p341_035.txt|I am proud of moments like that.
p341_036.txt|That was no surprise to me.
p341_037.txt|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_038.txt|There is no escape.
p341_039.txt|It's wonderful to have won.
p341_040.txt|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_041.txt|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341_042.txt|I fell into it by accident.
p341_043.txt|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044.txt|This is a big advantage.
p341_045.txt|Her daughter is getting married.
p341_046.txt|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047.txt|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p341_048.txt|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049.txt|Today is not about contracts.
p341_050.txt|That says something for his strength of character.
p341_051.txt|We are going for it.
p341_052.txt|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341_053.txt|It's to do with play.
p341_054.txt|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341_055.txt|I've just got to do this.
p341_056.txt|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p341_057.txt|So the process was refined.
p341_058.txt|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_059.txt|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p341_060.txt|I think it is a sensible change.
p341_061.txt|Sex is fun?
p341_062.txt|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341_063.txt|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p341_064.txt|This is the crossroads.
p341_065.txt|He had played well in that central role.
p341_066.txt|He is pretty upset.
p341_067.txt|And who would argue with that?
p341_068.txt|Where is the human rights?
p341_069.txt|We must put a marker down.
p341_070.txt|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071.txt|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341_072.txt|It is time to give her a rest.
p341_073.txt|They had had time for little else.
p341_074.txt|The feeling is awesome.
p341_075.txt|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341_076.txt|But there was a shift.
p341_077.txt|The settlement could run to millions.
p341_078.txt|It does not stop at the border.
p341_079.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p341_080.txt|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_081.txt|Robert is a special talent.
p341_082.txt|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341_083.txt|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p341_084.txt|They are going to carry it through.
p341_085.txt|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341_086.txt|You can't keep them separate.
p341_087.txt|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_088.txt|I still feel like a wee boy.
p341_089.txt|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341_090.txt|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_091.txt|It had a gigantic effect.
p341_092.txt|Israel has done very little until now.
p341_093.txt|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_094.txt|We are losing this war.
p341_095.txt|It's a difficult one to play.
p341_096.txt|The death rates are still as high.
p341_097.txt|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341_098.txt|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099.txt|We certainly will need to watch him.
p341_100.txt|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_101.txt|That meant the search was unlawful.
p341_102.txt|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341_103.txt|People buy everything with cash.
p341_104.txt|We are trying to establish a date.
p341_105.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p341_106.txt|The website is now being amended.
p341_107.txt|There was great support all round the route.
p341_108.txt|I was a bit nervous.
p341_109.txt|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_110.txt|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_111.txt|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p341_112.txt|I love this tournament.
p341_113.txt|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_114.txt|He had a heart problem.
p341_115.txt|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_116.txt|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p341_117.txt|Both managements are very supportive.
p341_118.txt|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_119.txt|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p341_120.txt|The choice is strictly personal.
p341_121.txt|We are going to go about our lives.
p341_122.txt|He had other things on his mind.
p341_123.txt|The lady is right.
p341_124.txt|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_125.txt|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p341_126.txt|The next few months will tell.
p341_127.txt|I'm so proud of my team.
p341_128.txt|It is crucial for both teams.
p341_129.txt|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p341_130.txt|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_131.txt|You can see their point.
p341_132.txt|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p341_133.txt|There was no hint of bravado.
p341_134.txt|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341_135.txt|Yet he chose to do something different.
p341_136.txt|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p341_137.txt|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p341_138.txt|There were no casualties.
p341_139.txt|The case will now go to appeal.
p341_140.txt|They really did a great job.
p341_141.txt|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p341_142.txt|They are still going to be impulsive.
p341_143.txt|I love you so very much.
p341_144.txt|He is a very nice man.
p341_145.txt|The road was closed for several hours.
p341_146.txt|Their condition was described as stable.
p341_147.txt|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341_148.txt|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p341_149.txt|I had a tie in my hand.
p341_150.txt|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p341_151.txt|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p341_152.txt|Such a city does not exist.
p341_153.txt|My aim is a top six finish.
p341_154.txt|He came in an army uniform.
p341_155.txt|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_156.txt|It was to no avail.
p341_157.txt|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_158.txt|But my heart is in athletics.
p341_159.txt|That is in the very nature of farming.
p341_160.txt|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_161.txt|These matters are now behind us.
p341_162.txt|I'm working on that.
p341_163.txt|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_164.txt|It was then into overtime.
p341_165.txt|Most of the public are behind me.
p341_166.txt|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341_167.txt|It really is a gift to the world.
p341_168.txt|Look at his last couple of records.
p341_169.txt|I am still very much a director.
p341_170.txt|We must not give in to bastards.
p341_171.txt|She may even appear in some more films.
p341_172.txt|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p341_173.txt|My house was shaking at the time.
p341_174.txt|They will know they deserve to be there.
p341_175.txt|Of course he is.
p341_176.txt|This is a very positive step forward.
p341_177.txt|This is a huge confidence boost.
p341_178.txt|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p341_179.txt|And does it?
p341_180.txt|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341_181.txt|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341_182.txt|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_183.txt|She is a very lucky lady.
p341_184.txt|It's the whole season.
p341_185.txt|We've been there for seven years.
p341_186.txt|Promises were not kept.
p341_187.txt|His signature is his handwriting.
p341_188.txt|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_189.txt|I've already done that.
p341_190.txt|We are on the path of change.
p341_191.txt|You can feel at home in China.
p341_192.txt|Who is he?
p341_193.txt|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_194.txt|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_195.txt|Felt good about it.
p341_196.txt|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_197.txt|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341_198.txt|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_199.txt|What's the big idea?
p341_200.txt|One season, they might do well.
p341_201.txt|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341_202.txt|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p341_203.txt|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_204.txt|It's up to their parents to choose.
p341_205.txt|I feel privileged to be here.
p341_206.txt|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341_207.txt|She told me to apply for the crest.
p341_208.txt|Too much has already been said.
p341_209.txt|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p341_210.txt|He explained to his audience.
p341_211.txt|I think the Government should pay for that.
p341_212.txt|I asked why he had come.
p341_213.txt|He was a soldier.
p341_214.txt|The budget was too low for that.
p341_215.txt|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_216.txt|It didn't get any better.
p341_217.txt|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_218.txt|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341_219.txt|I am totally devoted to this job.
p341_220.txt|I just could not cope.
p341_221.txt|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_222.txt|It is all one-sided.
p341_223.txt|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_224.txt|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_225.txt|Here are some possible solutions.
p341_226.txt|That's the day job.
p341_227.txt|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_228.txt|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_229.txt|I'm not saying he is finished.
p341_230.txt|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341_231.txt|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_232.txt|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p341_233.txt|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p341_234.txt|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_236.txt|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p341_237.txt|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341_238.txt|We believe we have a strong case.
p341_239.txt|I lost it at the final whistle.
p341_240.txt|Bill is a mentor.
p341_241.txt|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_242.txt|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_243.txt|One must hope not!
p341_244.txt|It was a big day.
p341_245.txt|What makes a house a home?
p341_246.txt|I think however, he was having a fit!
p341_247.txt|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341_248.txt|I will not be pressured.
p341_249.txt|It doesn't make sense.
p341_250.txt|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_251.txt|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_252.txt|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_253.txt|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341_254.txt|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p341_255.txt|Do not listen to them.
p341_256.txt|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p341_257.txt|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341_258.txt|He loves the big occasions.
p341_259.txt|Our system is archaic.
p341_260.txt|It was a tactical change.
p341_261.txt|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p341_262.txt|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341_263.txt|This time, there were no such rewards.
p341_264.txt|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341_265.txt|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p341_266.txt|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341_267.txt|She became very good at it.
p341_268.txt|We don't have the credible evidence.
p341_269.txt|It's one up to the Scots.
p341_270.txt|I'm just doing artwork.
p341_271.txt|And we still have to pay his salary.
p341_272.txt|Also, he was flawed.
p341_273.txt|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_274.txt|So there's a double whammy.
p341_275.txt|I didn't have a trio.
p341_276.txt|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_277.txt|That is a mark of what you are.
p341_278.txt|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_279.txt|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341_280.txt|I hope my successor will do the same.
p341_281.txt|The manager knew me very well.
p341_282.txt|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_283.txt|Are you in this movie?
p341_284.txt|We've got a full house tonight.
p341_285.txt|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341_286.txt|The fans will support us.
p341_287.txt|Make sure you see it.
p341_288.txt|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p341_289.txt|We are aware of the two incidents.
p341_290.txt|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341_291.txt|It was just one of those things.
p341_292.txt|The whole team was rubbish.
p341_293.txt|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_294.txt|You've got it coming Kabul.
p341_295.txt|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_296.txt|They too refused to come out and talk.
p341_297.txt|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341_298.txt|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p341_299.txt|That was enough for the committee.
p341_300.txt|It's a source of deep concern.
p341_301.txt|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341_302.txt|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p341_303.txt|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p341_304.txt|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_305.txt|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341_306.txt|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341_307.txt|The Dow Jones is way up.
p341_308.txt|We have to adapt to this level.
p341_309.txt|They were the better side on the day.
p341_310.txt|What are you going to do exactly?
p341_311.txt|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p341_312.txt|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_313.txt|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_314.txt|No-one thought about this.
p341_315.txt|We're all in a state of shock.
p341_316.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p341_317.txt|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_318.txt|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_319.txt|This is very bad news.
p341_320.txt|He was released in March this year.
p341_321.txt|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p341_322.txt|I stayed away from the defence.
p341_323.txt|We do need to get the message across.
p341_324.txt|Instead, she just went away.
p341_325.txt|That did not go down well.
p341_326.txt|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341_327.txt|It was chaotic and frightening.
p341_328.txt|It is a question of balance.
p341_329.txt|Soon the whole country will be level.
p341_330.txt|And huge, indeed, it is.
p341_331.txt|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_332.txt|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_333.txt|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341_334.txt|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341_335.txt|He said he needed no more evidence.
p341_336.txt|People might not actually want the job.
p341_337.txt|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_338.txt|It broke up my marriage.
p341_339.txt|They told us about it the next day.
p341_340.txt|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p341_341.txt|If there is default.
p341_342.txt|We are very nearly there.
p341_343.txt|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_344.txt|We have to go for it.
p341_345.txt|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_346.txt|Barry will be able to handle this.
p341_347.txt|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_348.txt|The urgency is real.
p341_349.txt|I've already got them in.
p341_350.txt|He takes time out for everyone.
p341_351.txt|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p341_352.txt|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_353.txt|I can't stop people thinking.
p341_354.txt|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_355.txt|I have not been so angry for years.
p341_356.txt|She had every right to read the warrant.
p341_357.txt|This is normal for him now.
p341_358.txt|Nothing was going to go right.
p341_359.txt|There is too much at stake for that.
p341_360.txt|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_361.txt|That's an old idea.
p341_362.txt|Scotland is losing business.
p341_363.txt|The place became a war zone.
p341_364.txt|What's happening to her?
p341_365.txt|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341_366.txt|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341_367.txt|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_368.txt|I don't have a new house.
p341_369.txt|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341_370.txt|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_371.txt|You are a liar.
p341_372.txt|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_373.txt|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_374.txt|See it while you can.
p341_375.txt|Folk music is in her blood.
p341_376.txt|And we all understand that.
p341_377.txt|One policeman was killed.
p341_378.txt|And it's not funny.
p341_379.txt|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_380.txt|We cannot lose it.
p341_381.txt|They have learned from that.
p341_382.txt|We have been working together for some years.
p341_383.txt|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341_384.txt|We only lost the third goal.
p341_385.txt|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_386.txt|That gave us some confidence.
p341_387.txt|No-one has yet been charged.
p341_388.txt|Such people do not exist.
p341_389.txt|Is this new report the answer?
p341_390.txt|Then came the second round.
p341_391.txt|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_392.txt|There was someone on the floor.
p341_393.txt|Story time is over - it's a war.
p341_394.txt|Maybe, who knows?
p341_395.txt|However, this idea is never developed.
p341_396.txt|But it is all by design.
p341_397.txt|It was a sell-out.
p341_398.txt|We've still got a say in this.
p341_399.txt|Things are going very well.
p341_400.txt|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p341_401.txt|I'll take what comes along.
p341_402.txt|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_403.txt|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_404.txt|Golf has lost a great character.
p341_405.txt|You have to have some hope and faith.
p341_406.txt|They hold on for many years.
p341_407.txt|However, the report was incorrect.
p341_408.txt|Women reported more depression than men.
p341_409.txt|He needs to be.
p341_410.txt|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p343_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p343_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p343_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p343_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p343_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_019.txt|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343_020.txt|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p343_025.txt|I've got a long way to go.
p343_026.txt|I'll go to the races.
p343_027.txt|We will be back next year.
p343_028.txt|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343_029.txt|It is a crucial award.
p343_030.txt|People don't feel safe, including me.
p343_031.txt|Survival is our aim.
p343_032.txt|But it might have done.
p343_033.txt|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_034.txt|What can you do?
p343_035.txt|I read it every year.
p343_036.txt|I go in for the parts.
p343_037.txt|It should be the reverse.
p343_038.txt|We are a team of hard workers.
p343_039.txt|It is up to Ann.
p343_040.txt|And you know something?
p343_041.txt|We were with him the whole time.
p343_042.txt|That was the theory, anyway.
p343_043.txt|We've all been here before.
p343_044.txt|I had troubles with the producers.
p343_045.txt|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343_046.txt|He died the following year.
p343_047.txt|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048.txt|He is trying really hard.
p343_049.txt|I have no doubt about that.
p343_050.txt|It is a beautiful country.
p343_051.txt|I expect a rapid response.
p343_052.txt|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_053.txt|This was never a support group.
p343_054.txt|I must take a seat.
p343_055.txt|My mother is a widow.
p343_056.txt|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057.txt|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p343_058.txt|The matter will come up again.
p343_059.txt|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060.txt|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061.txt|He should be a great asset.
p343_062.txt|But that's another story for another day.
p343_063.txt|One thing is sure.
p343_064.txt|He has really done well.
p343_065.txt|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066.txt|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067.txt|Funding needs to be long term.
p343_068.txt|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069.txt|It was just awful.
p343_070.txt|That is really all.
p343_071.txt|We played too deeply.
p343_072.txt|We could have got three medals.
p343_073.txt|I am ready to go.
p343_074.txt|We are still suffering from that.
p343_075.txt|The script was funny.
p343_076.txt|We are at the crossroads.
p343_077.txt|I am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078.txt|They were at school together.
p343_079.txt|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_080.txt|Painful, but only because it's true.
p343_081.txt|Once they go away they won't come back.
p343_082.txt|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p343_083.txt|That was the easy election.
p343_084.txt|I didn't understand it.
p343_085.txt|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_086.txt|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_087.txt|No one was listening.
p343_088.txt|I will report in the spring.
p343_089.txt|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_090.txt|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p343_091.txt|It's terrible that this is happening.
p343_092.txt|He's got the same story.
p343_093.txt|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343_094.txt|It is par for the course, of course.
p343_095.txt|And so it goes on.
p343_096.txt|The winner will be announced next month.
p343_097.txt|What was this?
p343_098.txt|I am not a fan of books.
p343_099.txt|It may well have been.
p343_100.txt|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343_101.txt|We can only go up.
p343_102.txt|I am not a doctor.
p343_103.txt|It is all in the mind.
p343_104.txt|And we have beaten them before.
p343_105.txt|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_106.txt|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p343_107.txt|I am not a paedophile.
p343_108.txt|I've got to get noticed!
p343_109.txt|Not that it was needed.
p343_110.txt|It's up to them to decide.
p343_111.txt|But we can't have a casino.
p343_112.txt|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_113.txt|The odds are that it will.
p343_114.txt|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p343_115.txt|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_116.txt|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_117.txt|He also has property interests in the country.
p343_118.txt|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343_119.txt|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_120.txt|I cannot believe this decision.
p343_121.txt|This decision is destroying my family.
p343_122.txt|Why is that?
p343_123.txt|Well, the big day has arrived.
p343_124.txt|We reckon we can do very well.
p343_125.txt|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_126.txt|It has been a great day.
p343_127.txt|We are not with you.
p343_128.txt|Then came the crunch.
p343_129.txt|If so, they were wrong.
p343_130.txt|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343_131.txt|The answer is maybe.
p343_132.txt|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343_133.txt|The referee had a shocking game.
p343_134.txt|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_135.txt|It's about doing things.
p343_136.txt|For a few years we had good fun.
p343_137.txt|All the pressure will be on him.
p343_139.txt|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_140.txt|That was a good effort.
p343_141.txt|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_142.txt|He must not be removed from office.
p343_143.txt|He had finally had enough.
p343_144.txt|But not all were so defiant.
p343_145.txt|We are not going to get carried away.
p343_146.txt|I told that to the police.
p343_147.txt|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343_148.txt|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343_149.txt|But when we do it it is great.
p343_150.txt|I'm going to win the gold.
p343_151.txt|He pleaded for caution.
p343_152.txt|It always had to be about the gym.
p343_153.txt|Only one got through.
p343_154.txt|It's like a garage.
p343_155.txt|They've been wonderful to me.
p343_157.txt|I can't believe the buzz.
p343_158.txt|It is a traffic warden.
p343_159.txt|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343_160.txt|It had been played at festivals.
p343_161.txt|That never came to court as a charge.
p343_162.txt|Dancing was her life.
p343_163.txt|The latter way is my way.
p343_164.txt|Staff have been informed.
p343_165.txt|It is one of those things.
p343_166.txt|His is a success story by any standard.
p343_167.txt|Are his works inside out?
p343_168.txt|He can do no wrong.
p343_169.txt|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343_170.txt|Do they have to create seven majors?
p343_171.txt|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_172.txt|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343_173.txt|Is something which we just don't do.
p343_174.txt|That began as an accident.
p343_175.txt|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343_176.txt|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_177.txt|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_178.txt|I am looking forward to this film.
p343_179.txt|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_180.txt|The talking cannot go on too long.
p343_181.txt|I've got a young family.
p343_182.txt|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_183.txt|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_184.txt|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_185.txt|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p343_186.txt|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p343_187.txt|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343_188.txt|It was good today.
p343_189.txt|She really suffered for her art.
p343_190.txt|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_191.txt|That tells you something.
p343_192.txt|It has been a magical moment.
p343_193.txt|Is that not uncanny?
p343_194.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_195.txt|The hotel was huge.
p343_196.txt|These days are over.
p343_197.txt|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_198.txt|Well, you can have a tree.
p343_199.txt|Or so it is hoped.
p343_201.txt|He said to give a local injection.
p343_202.txt|This is an internal matter.
p343_203.txt|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_204.txt|They made such decisions in London.
p343_205.txt|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_206.txt|I was influenced by all of these things.
p343_207.txt|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_208.txt|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343_209.txt|Children also died in Britain.
p343_210.txt|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_211.txt|We want to get there.
p343_213.txt|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_214.txt|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_215.txt|The hearing was fair.
p343_216.txt|He has the edge.
p343_217.txt|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_218.txt|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343_219.txt|He saw it all as a big game.
p343_220.txt|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_221.txt|Here we have not had one hour.
p343_222.txt|That was never their agenda.
p343_223.txt|But he kept on repeating it.
p343_224.txt|She is currently in foster care.
p343_225.txt|That's the only thing that matters.
p343_226.txt|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_227.txt|The service will only survive with change.
p343_228.txt|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p343_229.txt|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343_230.txt|You have a very persuasive president.
p343_231.txt|It's always the same, isn't it?
p343_232.txt|She has not returned to work.
p343_233.txt|We could learn a lot from them.
p343_234.txt|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_235.txt|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_236.txt|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_237.txt|It's really good fun.
p343_238.txt|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_239.txt|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_240.txt|Is a drug dealer?
p343_241.txt|We did not complete the process.
p343_242.txt|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343_243.txt|Where are you taking her?
p343_244.txt|The weather forecast isn't good.
p343_245.txt|They have not been named.
p343_246.txt|He died later in hospital.
p343_247.txt|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p343_248.txt|He had a great game.
p343_249.txt|It's still got that at its heart.
p343_250.txt|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343_251.txt|We will turn the corner.
p343_252.txt|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p343_253.txt|There were too many mistakes.
p343_254.txt|He says it often enough.
p343_255.txt|However, my position remains the same.
p343_256.txt|It was totally out of the blue.
p343_257.txt|Horses are not affected.
p343_258.txt|It went on forever.
p343_259.txt|I'm not going to change from it.
p343_260.txt|And they are different.
p343_261.txt|It would have been very easily done.
p343_262.txt|He knows the course.
p343_263.txt|That idea is rubbish.
p343_264.txt|There is no room for error.
p343_265.txt|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_266.txt|As, indeed, they would be.
p343_267.txt|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p343_268.txt|We are all suffering.
p343_269.txt|People should make their own decisions.
p343_270.txt|That is a question for the next manager.
p343_271.txt|I knew people on that committee.
p343_273.txt|Again, we were lucky.
p343_274.txt|There was no argument.
p343_275.txt|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_276.txt|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_277.txt|I just need a bit of luck.
p343_278.txt|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_279.txt|We are talking about one family.
p343_280.txt|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_281.txt|The error appeared in a warrant.
p343_282.txt|Everything is so new.
p343_283.txt|It may take time to get it back.
p343_284.txt|Would they work together again?
p343_285.txt|I can feel the sound inside.
p343_286.txt|The answer is yes.
p343_287.txt|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_288.txt|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_289.txt|That is a personal matter.
p343_290.txt|The princess has had other health problems.
p343_291.txt|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_292.txt|The clarity is vital.
p343_293.txt|I could not sit in the stands.
p343_294.txt|He had a decision to make.
p343_295.txt|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_296.txt|It makes no influence on the public.
p343_297.txt|It's ahead of Labour.
p343_298.txt|It's the whole package.
p343_299.txt|I was totally wrong.
p343_300.txt|This has got to stop.
p343_301.txt|It was a matter of chance.
p343_302.txt|There is no point of looking any further.
p343_303.txt|It is a real concern.
p343_304.txt|Is it the flight?
p343_306.txt|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p343_307.txt|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_308.txt|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_309.txt|A compromise is essential.
p343_310.txt|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p343_311.txt|They need to be involved.
p343_312.txt|It was not a cover-up.
p343_313.txt|The children continue to talk to us.
p343_314.txt|You know the sort of thing.
p343_315.txt|I cannot say too much about them.
p343_316.txt|She went home from school and never returned.
p343_317.txt|I will work on her.
p343_318.txt|We told them in August.
p343_319.txt|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343_320.txt|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_321.txt|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_322.txt|It is now being examined.
p343_323.txt|It is so out of character.
p343_324.txt|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_325.txt|Our thoughts are with her.
p343_326.txt|It is time, he said.
p343_327.txt|Everyone believes in it.
p343_328.txt|We must learn to finish.
p343_331.txt|He was a one off.
p343_332.txt|That should give me a chance.
p343_333.txt|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343_334.txt|It is my last chance.
p343_335.txt|We played them off the pitch.
p343_336.txt|The service from the other players was super.
p343_337.txt|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_338.txt|He didn't let me down.
p343_339.txt|You have been warned.
p343_340.txt|We're not comparing like with like.
p343_341.txt|I started on fire a couple of times.
p343_342.txt|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343.txt|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343_344.txt|They will be up for it for sure.
p343_345.txt|So you let me know.
p343_346.txt|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343_347.txt|That will just be the beginning.
p343_348.txt|No one can say that about me.
p343_349.txt|That had not happened on this occasion.
p343_350.txt|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p343_351.txt|As a nation, we must become more active.
p343_352.txt|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p343_353.txt|It is safe in our hands.
p343_354.txt|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343_355.txt|We will need to look at that.
p343_356.txt|It comes down to the police in England.
p343_357.txt|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_358.txt|It is a gamble.
p343_359.txt|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p343_360.txt|The tribunal continues today.
p343_361.txt|These things have not happened by accident.
p343_362.txt|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p343_363.txt|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p343_364.txt|There's a hint of classical.
p343_365.txt|We had to take action to protect them.
p343_366.txt|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_367.txt|In the end, however, it all came together.
p343_368.txt|He is a visionary.
p343_369.txt|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_370.txt|There is always the smell.
p343_371.txt|I have to take some of the blame.
p343_372.txt|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_374.txt|He is lying to save his skin.
p343_375.txt|You have to do your research.
p343_376.txt|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343_377.txt|He took away my childhood.
p343_378.txt|I have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379.txt|The call was ignored.
p343_381.txt|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343_382.txt|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p343_383.txt|And there is another problem.
p343_384.txt|That is the theory.
p343_385.txt|It almost certainly is.
p343_386.txt|They will have five minutes to decide.
p343_387.txt|Because it's a secret.
p343_388.txt|My wife and family are the support system.
p343_389.txt|The body follows the mind.
p343_390.txt|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p343_391.txt|They are there to help us.
p343_392.txt|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_393.txt|You take a risk.
p343_394.txt|Which he is, too.
p343_395.txt|Each one is as good as the other.
p343_396.txt|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p343_397.txt|I have hardly any commitments.
p343_398.txt|There is no formula.
p343_399.txt|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p343_400.txt|I love the feel of the place.
p345_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p345_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p345_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p345_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p345_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p345_025.txt|This is a new era.
p345_026.txt|I want to go home.
p345_027.txt|All the people here are local.
p345_028.txt|The racist abuse was terrible.
p345_029.txt|What is the new religion?
p345_030.txt|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_031.txt|It's an amazing landscape!
p345_032.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p345_033.txt|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_034.txt|We had to laugh.
p345_035.txt|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345_036.txt|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_037.txt|I was completely knackered.
p345_038.txt|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_039.txt|A killer is also on the loose.
p345_040.txt|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041.txt|You've got to be vigilant.
p345_042.txt|You can see how he made his money.
p345_043.txt|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345_044.txt|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345_045.txt|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046.txt|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047.txt|His record with England was not good.
p345_048.txt|The opposite is the case.
p345_049.txt|Who would be a referee?
p345_050.txt|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345_051.txt|It was time to act.
p345_052.txt|It's a question of fashion.
p345_053.txt|I could never be cool.
p345_054.txt|We will be paying agency rates.
p345_055.txt|Others said he had gone too far.
p345_056.txt|We expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057.txt|He was between people and God.
p345_058.txt|I've never seen anything like it.
p345_059.txt|They were willing us to get a second.
p345_060.txt|No casualties were reported.
p345_061.txt|The classes are taking place.
p345_062.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345_063.txt|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064.txt|There will be no threat to the game.
p345_065.txt|It would be a last resort.
p345_066.txt|That is part of athletics.
p345_067.txt|Who would have known.
p345_068.txt|We were caught out.
p345_069.txt|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p345_070.txt|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071.txt|I had to lie.
p345_072.txt|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073.txt|Everyone was writing me off.
p345_074.txt|How do we get more people in?
p345_075.txt|The defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076.txt|But her parents will never see her again.
p345_077.txt|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078.txt|I have nothing to lose.
p345_079.txt|He would have loved it.
p345_080.txt|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345_081.txt|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_082.txt|It is a freedom.
p345_083.txt|What happens next?
p345_084.txt|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_085.txt|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_086.txt|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_087.txt|They should come clean.
p345_088.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_089.txt|I believe that so strongly.
p345_090.txt|That, though, is an old story.
p345_091.txt|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p345_092.txt|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_093.txt|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_094.txt|It was a funny feeling.
p345_095.txt|He was at it again yesterday.
p345_096.txt|You can't go on forever.
p345_097.txt|So far this season this approach is working.
p345_098.txt|However, his involvement was instant.
p345_099.txt|It has to work.
p345_100.txt|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345_101.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345_102.txt|There's something about being cut off.
p345_103.txt|This is his personal life.
p345_104.txt|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p345_105.txt|If not, a deal could take many months.
p345_106.txt|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_107.txt|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_108.txt|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_109.txt|What are they like?
p345_110.txt|I would probably have to agree with him.
p345_111.txt|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_112.txt|He had a moustache.
p345_113.txt|I have been thinking about that this week.
p345_114.txt|Let's get it on.
p345_115.txt|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_116.txt|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_117.txt|It is really good news.
p345_118.txt|We just want a fair deal.
p345_119.txt|I'll just have to live with that.
p345_120.txt|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_121.txt|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_122.txt|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_123.txt|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p345_124.txt|It is sad and frustrating.
p345_125.txt|Our intentions are real.
p345_126.txt|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_127.txt|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_128.txt|She has left the island.
p345_129.txt|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345_130.txt|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345_131.txt|It certainly should not be used too often.
p345_132.txt|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_133.txt|I don't know where that one came from.
p345_134.txt|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_135.txt|He would just say it was terrible.
p345_136.txt|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_137.txt|That's not fair to the supporters.
p345_138.txt|I was on my own.
p345_139.txt|They were part of our own family.
p345_140.txt|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_141.txt|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_142.txt|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_143.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345_144.txt|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345_145.txt|His name has not been released.
p345_146.txt|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345_147.txt|It plainly does not work.
p345_148.txt|His words were not audible.
p345_149.txt|That's a huge amount.
p345_150.txt|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p345_151.txt|It was even worse than at home.
p345_152.txt|I still think he will win.
p345_153.txt|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_154.txt|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_155.txt|It may have been a cry for help.
p345_156.txt|But the damage had been done.
p345_157.txt|No, you couldn't make it up.
p345_158.txt|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_159.txt|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345_160.txt|And so they have.
p345_161.txt|I have a great respect for her.
p345_162.txt|I suggest a new plan.
p345_163.txt|IT takes the biscuit.
p345_164.txt|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_165.txt|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_166.txt|Miller was every bit as happy.
p345_167.txt|The result is utterly compelling.
p345_168.txt|But it won't be the same.
p345_169.txt|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345_170.txt|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_171.txt|It is a hobby for me.
p345_172.txt|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_173.txt|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_174.txt|Bombing is the easy option.
p345_175.txt|We should have gone solo.
p345_176.txt|Directing, if you like.
p345_177.txt|That will be the case.
p345_178.txt|Now, it's all right.
p345_179.txt|All will be revealed in due course.
p345_180.txt|They have known the hard times.
p345_181.txt|We don't know what happened.
p345_182.txt|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_183.txt|They had seven children.
p345_184.txt|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_185.txt|Death is outside the language.
p345_186.txt|You have a plan?
p345_187.txt|It's all too early.
p345_188.txt|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_189.txt|We've seen that time and time again.
p345_190.txt|I was never alone with her, right?
p345_191.txt|It's not only my respect for them.
p345_192.txt|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345_193.txt|This is a very high price.
p345_194.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_195.txt|I never want to have any children.
p345_196.txt|Business has never been so bad.
p345_197.txt|There is no way to do this.
p345_198.txt|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_199.txt|I know my sons.
p345_200.txt|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_201.txt|It was too close to call.
p345_202.txt|But who is the killer?
p345_203.txt|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345_204.txt|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_205.txt|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345_206.txt|Then another one came.
p345_207.txt|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_208.txt|Everything has been destroyed.
p345_209.txt|The Lobby is not failing.
p345_210.txt|But it is looking very positive.
p345_211.txt|Drugs are getting through.
p345_212.txt|He would have come into the house.
p345_213.txt|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_214.txt|It happens in real life.
p345_215.txt|At the time, he was a living legend.
p345_216.txt|And we will do it.
p345_217.txt|It's a human tragedy.
p345_218.txt|But we are losing that connection.
p345_219.txt|I am going to fight to the end.
p345_220.txt|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_221.txt|It's the right thing.
p345_222.txt|That was a disgraceful performance.
p345_223.txt|Must have been at the bar.
p345_224.txt|But this is just the start.
p345_225.txt|I can't get away from it.
p345_226.txt|I believe in the Union.
p345_227.txt|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p345_228.txt|But he is not hopeful.
p345_229.txt|It will be all about the Olympics.
p345_230.txt|They are very frightened.
p345_231.txt|We have all been there at some point.
p345_232.txt|This is my homeland.
p345_233.txt|The game was up.
p345_234.txt|That is not an easy thing.
p345_235.txt|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_236.txt|I didn't know where they were.
p345_237.txt|Rangers are my life.
p345_238.txt|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_239.txt|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p345_240.txt|There are two options.
p345_241.txt|I can't describe it.
p345_242.txt|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_243.txt|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_244.txt|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345_245.txt|This is wonderful news.
p345_246.txt|I am appalled by this news.
p345_247.txt|No injuries were reported.
p345_248.txt|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p345_249.txt|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_250.txt|It's too much work.
p345_251.txt|We were extremely arrogant.
p345_252.txt|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345_253.txt|THE waiting game continues.
p345_254.txt|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_255.txt|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_256.txt|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_257.txt|But the foundations have been laid.
p345_258.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_259.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_260.txt|What is so unusual about this case?
p345_261.txt|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_262.txt|But this is different.
p345_263.txt|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_264.txt|It doesn't look good.
p345_265.txt|That will not change.
p345_267.txt|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_268.txt|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_269.txt|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_270.txt|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_271.txt|They've been at it for five hours.
p345_272.txt|This action could have been avoided.
p345_273.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_274.txt|And they still have the final to come.
p345_275.txt|Anyone else can apply.
p345_276.txt|He looked like a schoolboy.
p345_277.txt|It was like the old days.
p345_278.txt|But that is about to change.
p345_279.txt|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_280.txt|We can build on that.
p345_281.txt|It could be a danger.
p345_282.txt|We are not going to be complacent.
p345_283.txt|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345_284.txt|His body was found in May.
p345_285.txt|He's a joy to follow.
p345_286.txt|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345_287.txt|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_288.txt|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_289.txt|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p345_290.txt|It starts to get you down.
p345_291.txt|I don't think we could have expected better.
p345_292.txt|My life has been turned upside down.
p345_293.txt|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_294.txt|But they miss the whole point.
p345_295.txt|You have to count on other people.
p345_296.txt|I said, What was that about?
p345_297.txt|Immediate action must be taken.
p345_298.txt|This could prove a problem.
p345_299.txt|I was a local hero.
p345_300.txt|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p345_301.txt|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_302.txt|It's a gigantic con.
p345_303.txt|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345_304.txt|This club have been fair to me.
p345_305.txt|I didn't know she could do that.
p345_306.txt|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_307.txt|This is too much like Scotland.
p345_308.txt|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309.txt|A counter reaction was.
p345_310.txt|That goes back a long way.
p345_311.txt|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_312.txt|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p345_313.txt|They were not missing much.
p345_314.txt|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_315.txt|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_316.txt|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317.txt|It's always a dilemma.
p345_318.txt|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345_319.txt|Is she in trouble?
p345_320.txt|It is a symbolic concert.
p345_321.txt|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p345_322.txt|It is a very beautiful city.
p345_323.txt|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345_324.txt|But could it afford to run it?
p345_325.txt|I am very happy with him.
p345_326.txt|I was waiting for that question.
p345_327.txt|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_328.txt|I am not against a further inquiry.
p345_329.txt|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345_330.txt|WHO would have thought it?
p345_331.txt|We will win the argument.
p345_332.txt|Five years later, the deception continued.
p345_333.txt|I might get an injury very easily.
p345_334.txt|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_335.txt|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_336.txt|I just want to do the good work.
p345_337.txt|I'm very happy tonight.
p345_338.txt|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_339.txt|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_340.txt|Now it was serious.
p345_341.txt|This is his first movie.
p345_342.txt|He is already in place.
p345_343.txt|No one would believe him.
p345_344.txt|We live in shorthand.
p345_345.txt|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_346.txt|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_347.txt|I made a big mistake.
p345_348.txt|I just know it's a lot.
p345_349.txt|I saw one body.
p345_350.txt|I am very happy.
p345_351.txt|There was no discussion about it.
p345_352.txt|Three hours later, the man was free.
p345_353.txt|It was a very big win for us.
p345_354.txt|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_355.txt|Everything is up for grabs.
p345_356.txt|We had a good time.
p345_357.txt|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345_358.txt|This was a good performance.
p345_359.txt|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p345_360.txt|It is not simple.
p345_361.txt|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_362.txt|Our task is to complete the picture.
p345_363.txt|It is a road of death.
p345_364.txt|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345_365.txt|Her life is now back on track.
p345_366.txt|I said at the time it was wrong.
p345_367.txt|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_368.txt|Anything that was going, really.
p345_369.txt|He will take it in his stride.
p345_370.txt|I don't believe a word of it.
p345_371.txt|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_372.txt|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_373.txt|The winner will be announced in December.
p345_374.txt|This is bound to happen.
p345_375.txt|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345_376.txt|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_377.txt|The letters are going out today.
p345_378.txt|I did not name it.
p345_379.txt|And therein lies the problem.
p345_380.txt|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p345_381.txt|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_382.txt|Or is it?
p345_383.txt|Is he going to look after them?
p345_384.txt|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_385.txt|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345_386.txt|It is quite simple.
p345_389.txt|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_390.txt|His instructions were clear.
p345_391.txt|There is ample evidence.
p345_392.txt|It was a game we had to win.
p345_393.txt|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_394.txt|To begin with it looks good.
p345_395.txt|I won't go back to Holland.
p345_396.txt|There is still a long way to go.
p345_397.txt|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345_398.txt|This was a unique election.
p345_399.txt|It was still there last night.
p345_400.txt|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p360_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p360_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p360_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p360_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p360_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p360_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p360_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p360_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p360_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p360_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p360_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p360_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p360_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p360_025.txt|You can never take a win for granted.
p360_026.txt|My conscience is not clear.
p360_027.txt|Is that it?
p360_028.txt|You have been warned.
p360_029.txt|You are not allowed to do that.
p360_030.txt|That depends on Rangers.
p360_031.txt|There are two problems.
p360_032.txt|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p360_033.txt|It's something which is very important to me.
p360_034.txt|For once he was wrong.
p360_035.txt|He would not have to explain.
p360_036.txt|I want to deliver a learning society.
p360_037.txt|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_038.txt|I had to be into it.
p360_039.txt|I'm so grateful for that.
p360_040.txt|It's not been a good year.
p360_041.txt|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p360_042.txt|I have no intention of resigning today.
p360_043.txt|That has now gone.
p360_044.txt|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_045.txt|This will take up to nine months.
p360_046.txt|And maybe they have.
p360_047.txt|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p360_048.txt|Is he conscious?
p360_049.txt|But we are confident.
p360_050.txt|It is like a football team.
p360_051.txt|When he came to see me on Monday.
p360_052.txt|That's a concern to me.
p360_053.txt|She said she was really sorry.
p360_054.txt|That will be important.
p360_055.txt|But here it is also very bad.
p360_056.txt|That view has not altered.
p360_057.txt|It was very full anyway.
p360_058.txt|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p360_059.txt|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_060.txt|But there is no easy option.
p360_061.txt|I can't believe she is dead.
p360_062.txt|No person was charged.
p360_063.txt|But it would say that.
p360_064.txt|Most of the works are small in scale.
p360_065.txt|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_066.txt|Only the bomber was killed.
p360_067.txt|But he just carried on anyway.
p360_068.txt|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_069.txt|It was that kind of afternoon.
p360_070.txt|His presence was very important.
p360_071.txt|What happens next?
p360_072.txt|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_073.txt|The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_074.txt|That took two weeks.
p360_075.txt|It's worth it, though.
p360_076.txt|That perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_077.txt|I have to hand it to the bank.
p360_078.txt|The question was simple enough.
p360_079.txt|The voters rejected us.
p360_080.txt|There was a definite prejudice.
p360_081.txt|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_082.txt|We never publicise it.
p360_083.txt|You will be very welcome.
p360_084.txt|His musicals were very much of their time.
p360_085.txt|He became enchanted with the process.
p360_086.txt|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_087.txt|It seems very odd.
p360_088.txt|They couldn't keep it together.
p360_089.txt|We discovered that for ourselves.
p360_090.txt|We will continue to provide support for them.
p360_091.txt|I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_092.txt|It was looking bad.
p360_093.txt|That's what makes it interesting.
p360_094.txt|It's nice to be involved.
p360_095.txt|It's not a game.
p360_096.txt|Buildings are about people.
p360_097.txt|There is much work to do.
p360_098.txt|The release attracted little attention.
p360_099.txt|It was the dreaded sentence.
p360_100.txt|I have never considered it.
p360_101.txt|It is not in the public interest.
p360_102.txt|They had been forced to walk.
p360_103.txt|It is harder than you think.
p360_104.txt|The call was ignored.
p360_105.txt|I am looking forward to it.
p360_106.txt|Consumers will also benefit.
p360_107.txt|That would be even more disastrous.
p360_108.txt|We opened up and everything was gone.
p360_109.txt|It is looking very special.
p360_110.txt|They offered to make an investment into it.
p360_111.txt|People were hitting the floor.
p360_112.txt|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_113.txt|They took a risk.
p360_114.txt|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_115.txt|It has no place in football.
p360_116.txt|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_117.txt|This is a classic.
p360_118.txt|He played it like a veteran.
p360_119.txt|I have spoken to head office.
p360_120.txt|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_121.txt|They will run a mile.
p360_122.txt|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_123.txt|Britain has never had it so good.
p360_124.txt|So many people will be affected by this.
p360_125.txt|It was all very good stuff.
p360_126.txt|Or was it?
p360_127.txt|We are under no illusions about this.
p360_128.txt|But they are a good team.
p360_129.txt|We have a long way to go.
p360_130.txt|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_131.txt|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p360_132.txt|I knew that we needed to get out.
p360_133.txt|I had a train to catch.
p360_134.txt|And this game is all about belief.
p360_135.txt|I am ready for that.
p360_136.txt|It is a fantasy.
p360_137.txt|The only safe investment is cash.
p360_138.txt|That's the way they are.
p360_139.txt|Elections would follow in about two years.
p360_140.txt|We are trying to be realistic.
p360_141.txt|That was the theory.
p360_142.txt|Or so it seemed.
p360_143.txt|Now we look forward to it.
p360_144.txt|That was worth it.
p360_145.txt|What's it going to be then?
p360_146.txt|Who was being affected?
p360_147.txt|Our players are exhausted.
p360_148.txt|It is deeply frustrating.
p360_149.txt|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_150.txt|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360_151.txt|This has been carried out.
p360_152.txt|Our time is up.
p360_153.txt|It was a moment of madness.
p360_154.txt|But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360_155.txt|First meeting was next week.
p360_156.txt|No, we were not exactly favourites.
p360_157.txt|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_158.txt|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360_159.txt|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_160.txt|However, we will have to wait and see.
p360_161.txt|I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_162.txt|I don't know how they do it.
p360_163.txt|Little is known about them.
p360_164.txt|It is a new company for Scotland.
p360_165.txt|We're very unhappy about it.
p360_166.txt|A good actor doesn't think.
p360_167.txt|But the action is about to be restarted.
p360_168.txt|It was extremely difficult.
p360_169.txt|It is about the script for me.
p360_170.txt|I have a good feeling about this.
p360_171.txt|And the results were impressive.
p360_172.txt|The next game is today.
p360_173.txt|Hopefully it will be a good day.
p360_174.txt|I was a silly bastard.
p360_175.txt|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_176.txt|The process will start tomorrow.
p360_177.txt|Was the punishment excessive?
p360_178.txt|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_179.txt|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p360_180.txt|I could easy do that.
p360_181.txt|We are really impressed.
p360_182.txt|I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_183.txt|You have to wait.
p360_184.txt|I did not see anything to begin with.
p360_185.txt|It's their moment of choice.
p360_186.txt|I certainly do not agree with that.
p360_187.txt|It was a disaster of a race.
p360_188.txt|Only one person can claim the credit.
p360_189.txt|Maintain the highest standards.
p360_190.txt|What could we do?
p360_191.txt|O Neill has delivered.
p360_192.txt|But there was no going back.
p360_193.txt|There are some good people in there.
p360_194.txt|But it won't make a difference.
p360_195.txt|I'm not going to blame the band.
p360_196.txt|I think that he got the message.
p360_197.txt|Here it was very subdued.
p360_198.txt|Stardom is a funny thing.
p360_199.txt|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p360_200.txt|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_201.txt|I sincerely hope not.
p360_202.txt|I'm really looking forward to that.
p360_203.txt|She would say he was still the best.
p360_204.txt|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_205.txt|We didn't, and it worked for us.
p360_206.txt|No-one has used it since then.
p360_207.txt|The baby was dead.
p360_208.txt|That remains the unanswered question.
p360_209.txt|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_210.txt|They tried to give her advice.
p360_211.txt|We should have no more problems.
p360_212.txt|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360_213.txt|An announcement is expected soon.
p360_214.txt|It was one of those things.
p360_215.txt|I can understand that.
p360_216.txt|But sometimes it was even worse.
p360_217.txt|We had to work hard for it.
p360_218.txt|That's a big reduction.
p360_219.txt|There will be good prospects ahead.
p360_220.txt|I was pleased about that.
p360_221.txt|That has not changed.
p360_222.txt|It's a creative energy.
p360_223.txt|We are not conducting the review.
p360_224.txt|It just never comes together.
p360_225.txt|The club has never won it.
p360_226.txt|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_227.txt|So it was at Easter Road.
p360_228.txt|It will be a huge difference.
p360_229.txt|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_230.txt|The characters are always the first attraction.
p360_231.txt|We've got better players here.
p360_232.txt|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_233.txt|This is wonderful news.
p360_234.txt|So what's it all about?
p360_235.txt|I think he was lost for words.
p360_236.txt|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p360_237.txt|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360_238.txt|This is a historic occasion.
p360_239.txt|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_240.txt|And what happens?
p360_241.txt|It is all very upbeat.
p360_242.txt|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_243.txt|We're looking for unity in the council.
p360_244.txt|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360_245.txt|We deserved the draw.
p360_246.txt|Just one of those things, we suppose.
p360_247.txt|It's up to the defence team.
p360_248.txt|No one was injured.
p360_249.txt|We have had our debate.
p360_250.txt|It is part of his game.
p360_251.txt|Did he just want to be on telly?
p360_252.txt|But it was too late.
p360_253.txt|I didn't see the point.
p360_254.txt|It seems a shame to leave it.
p360_255.txt|Who would have thought it?
p360_256.txt|They were all on a mission.
p360_257.txt|Human beings are always the same.
p360_258.txt|You will gain from that.
p360_259.txt|It makes me feel difficult.
p360_260.txt|We couldn't believe it at first.
p360_261.txt|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360_262.txt|He could still be President.
p360_263.txt|It can take a long time.
p360_264.txt|I don't intend to do so now.
p360_265.txt|There is no answer to it.
p360_266.txt|He was pleased with his display.
p360_267.txt|The first time you read a play.
p360_268.txt|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p360_269.txt|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p360_270.txt|He is having a nightmare.
p360_271.txt|That was six years ago.
p360_272.txt|Players have to accept this.
p360_273.txt|He is completely committed to us.
p360_274.txt|Neither had the public.
p360_275.txt|It disappeared into the cup.
p360_276.txt|They might well be right.
p360_277.txt|I have no further comment to make.
p360_278.txt|The warning is timely.
p360_279.txt|Those were the days.
p360_280.txt|The joint bid is still on course.
p360_281.txt|A press conference is about politics.
p360_282.txt|It was important to bring them all together.
p360_283.txt|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_284.txt|They tend to be female and retired.
p360_285.txt|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_286.txt|It looks as though he will be right.
p360_287.txt|We know the fight is going to happen.
p360_288.txt|I have played well the past two days.
p360_289.txt|Is it on a building site?
p360_290.txt|That is the key.
p360_291.txt|We've been here before.
p360_292.txt|I am in a good position.
p360_293.txt|I have never been unemployed.
p360_294.txt|We are in it for the long-term.
p360_295.txt|But it didn't bother me.
p360_296.txt|I believe it will happen.
p360_297.txt|And Michael was just great.
p360_298.txt|He did it well.
p360_299.txt|Why have you decided to get married?
p360_300.txt|Is it all real?
p360_301.txt|He will be missed.
p360_302.txt|I would not descend to that level.
p360_303.txt|They were not at the property yesterday.
p360_304.txt|We will not tolerate it.
p360_305.txt|I'm really proud of her.
p360_306.txt|What does this mean?
p360_307.txt|They are not falling now.
p360_308.txt|We are not physical at all.
p360_309.txt|Have we not been here before?
p360_310.txt|I've been waiting a long time.
p360_311.txt|The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_312.txt|You just have to get on with it.
p360_313.txt|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_314.txt|And that match was played in June.
p360_315.txt|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360_316.txt|I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_317.txt|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360_318.txt|I have learned a lot.
p360_319.txt|It won't be their last.
p360_320.txt|You've got to have both sides.
p360_321.txt|He has yet to receive a reply.
p360_322.txt|It has been only average.
p360_323.txt|He should be worried about me.
p360_324.txt|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p360_325.txt|For me, any manager is good.
p360_326.txt|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_327.txt|That was the gimmick.
p360_328.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p360_329.txt|He has changed my life forever.
p360_330.txt|I have no idea.
p360_331.txt|This plan is all about respect.
p360_332.txt|I don't think he played his best.
p360_333.txt|Pakistan denied the report.
p360_334.txt|It will be up to the government.
p360_335.txt|That is a tragedy.
p360_336.txt|I am very happy.
p360_337.txt|A child is not a product.
p360_338.txt|But this is nonsense.
p360_339.txt|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360_340.txt|I'm going to miss it.
p360_341.txt|There will be no backing down.
p360_342.txt|The atmosphere was excellent.
p360_343.txt|That must have had an effect.
p360_344.txt|They have brought in the replacement.
p360_345.txt|How did it all come about?
p360_346.txt|We are working so hard.
p360_347.txt|One was a lawyer.
p360_348.txt|Our position is extremely simple.
p360_349.txt|Where did that finish?
p360_350.txt|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_351.txt|The most important thing was to win today.
p360_352.txt|Golf is not like that.
p360_353.txt|This is a moment to seize.
p360_354.txt|I would not do that.
p360_355.txt|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360_356.txt|They said that they stood by their statement.
p360_357.txt|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360_358.txt|That has to be allowed.
p360_359.txt|He has never let them down.
p360_360.txt|There was no-one of the required standard.
p360_361.txt|That would be very good for Rangers.
p360_362.txt|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p360_363.txt|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_364.txt|That gives it a spirit.
p360_365.txt|She has never been back.
p360_366.txt|It will set the tone.
p360_367.txt|They are not going away.
p360_368.txt|Having done it, he was asked again.
p360_369.txt|I think he will.
p360_370.txt|The package is a changing one.
p360_371.txt|I'm working on that one, too.
p360_372.txt|Frankly, that's not good enough.
p360_373.txt|Or is it?
p360_374.txt|What's the difference?
p360_375.txt|The whole family was in shock.
p360_376.txt|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_377.txt|Craig is a major concern for us.
p360_378.txt|The problems began a long time ago.
p360_379.txt|It meant a lot to us.
p360_380.txt|What other retailer would do this?
p360_381.txt|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p360_382.txt|This country has many challenges.
p360_383.txt|Their families are gone.
p360_384.txt|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p360_385.txt|I didn't do it.
p360_386.txt|They are with their father.
p360_387.txt|They're all doing it.
p360_388.txt|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_389.txt|No, they are not the same thing.
p360_390.txt|In football it is not always the case.
p360_391.txt|Sometimes we find a person.
p360_392.txt|It is a natural reaction.
p360_393.txt|I am in a very difficult position.
p360_394.txt|I had to win this race.
p360_395.txt|They could have been told in advance.
p360_396.txt|And what do we have?
p360_397.txt|It is a relief.
p360_398.txt|The boat was fantastic.
p360_399.txt|These were the edited highlights.
p360_400.txt|That is the difference.
p360_401.txt|You will need it.
p360_402.txt|There is so much at stake.
p360_403.txt|It has great potential.
p360_404.txt|They had three children.
p360_405.txt|It was all too little, too late.
p360_406.txt|Still, it is a very good result for us.
p360_407.txt|And he's not alone.
p360_408.txt|What was all that about?
p360_409.txt|What's the problem with change?
p360_410.txt|I intend to end it on a high.
p360_411.txt|What she can't have is the money.
p360_412.txt|I thought they played well.
p360_413.txt|This is not the end.
p360_414.txt|And they went on to win the title.
p360_415.txt|Now, she will not be running at all.
p360_416.txt|It's not an impression.
p360_417.txt|This was great for our sport.
p360_418.txt|There's no place to hide.
p360_419.txt|I don't think they are too serious.
p360_420.txt|Tiger is the exception.
p360_421.txt|There was no happy ending.
p360_422.txt|They need time to think.
p360_423.txt|It's unfair on her.
p360_424.txt|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p361_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p361_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p361_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p361_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p361_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p361_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p361_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p361_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p361_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p361_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p361_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p361_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p361_025.txt|Something has to be done.
p361_026.txt|That is where the damage has been done.
p361_027.txt|He may not need to force that message.
p361_028.txt|These decisions are not simple.
p361_029.txt|The results were very clear.
p361_030.txt|We must convince the citizens.
p361_031.txt|I decided it is going to be William.
p361_032.txt|But we need to keep it there.
p361_033.txt|It is a case of taking a risk.
p361_034.txt|I am really ready for it now.
p361_035.txt|He was jailed for four years.
p361_036.txt|We felt it was sufficient.
p361_037.txt|This decision is folly.
p361_038.txt|And this was well known?
p361_039.txt|It took two minutes to respond.
p361_040.txt|Why you did it will never be known.
p361_041.txt|He was in his element.
p361_042.txt|That means an extra two years.
p361_043.txt|So, we have to go back.
p361_044.txt|I'm sure he does.
p361_045.txt|He was found again almost a year later.
p361_046.txt|The answer was wrong.
p361_047.txt|They need to be helped.
p361_048.txt|It is all starting to come together.
p361_049.txt|I am the fastest player on the course.
p361_050.txt|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_051.txt|They were taken to prove a point.
p361_052.txt|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361_053.txt|It is an important step forward.
p361_054.txt|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_055.txt|And they removed a Borderer.
p361_056.txt|That is the way it is.
p361_057.txt|That was something else.
p361_058.txt|This resulted in the following.
p361_059.txt|I want to deal with this stuff.
p361_060.txt|We will be patient but we will win.
p361_061.txt|As good as they come.
p361_062.txt|It is not for me to say.
p361_063.txt|For that much we must be grateful.
p361_064.txt|But the law is very clear on this.
p361_065.txt|I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_066.txt|But we are very near.
p361_067.txt|Nobody else is at risk.
p361_068.txt|We are not going to back off.
p361_069.txt|He said it was for sale.
p361_070.txt|We have a strong team at the moment.
p361_071.txt|This is a dream come true.
p361_072.txt|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361_073.txt|It is on the news.
p361_074.txt|They said there was nothing.
p361_075.txt|They were looking for things.
p361_076.txt|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361_077.txt|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_078.txt|As it should be.
p361_079.txt|We have never been short of volunteers.
p361_080.txt|But who is it?
p361_081.txt|Kenny Miller might come through.
p361_082.txt|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_083.txt|It just isn't there.
p361_084.txt|Drama is not one of them.
p361_085.txt|And we have a singer.
p361_086.txt|It was exactly four months away.
p361_087.txt|This is a personal decision for me.
p361_088.txt|It's just a failing service.
p361_089.txt|We all want to be left alone.
p361_090.txt|I was saying, No.
p361_091.txt|Where are they?
p361_092.txt|I am delighted to hear this news.
p361_093.txt|I knew him a little.
p361_094.txt|They just have a go.
p361_095.txt|If it's going in, it goes in.
p361_096.txt|Nobody called me to explain.
p361_097.txt|You didn't get a modified.
p361_098.txt|What kind of person is he?
p361_099.txt|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p361_100.txt|What has changed since then?
p361_101.txt|He knows he is good.
p361_102.txt|I welcome the decision.
p361_103.txt|It could take some time.
p361_104.txt|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361_105.txt|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361_106.txt|I've done a lot in that building.
p361_107.txt|Music is all consuming.
p361_108.txt|The results are very positive.
p361_109.txt|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361_110.txt|Which is where we come in.
p361_111.txt|I'm not looking forward to it.
p361_112.txt|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p361_113.txt|He is a pro.
p361_114.txt|They have to tell it as it is.
p361_115.txt|This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_116.txt|You should enjoy the day.
p361_117.txt|He was taken ill in his office.
p361_118.txt|We couldn't get enough of it.
p361_119.txt|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p361_120.txt|I am not very pleased.
p361_121.txt|It is just a statement of fact.
p361_122.txt|It was on my mind a little bit.
p361_123.txt|I will just have to be patient.
p361_124.txt|I didn't think about it again.
p361_125.txt|And if they fail?
p361_126.txt|He has gone through the process before.
p361_127.txt|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p361_128.txt|We've always had something to do.
p361_129.txt|How do you take them away?
p361_130.txt|It will be released in October.
p361_132.txt|That got me out.
p361_133.txt|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p361_134.txt|It's a matter for the Committee.
p361_135.txt|It will have to ratify the deal.
p361_136.txt|I've never seen anything like it.
p361_137.txt|It was highly successful.
p361_138.txt|We needed someone and we now have him.
p361_139.txt|It has to find out what went wrong.
p361_140.txt|Only one was from Glasgow.
p361_141.txt|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_142.txt|Until you hit the big games.
p361_143.txt|They received no money under the merger.
p361_144.txt|It was a big departure.
p361_145.txt|She has never mentioned it.
p361_146.txt|I want my mum.
p361_147.txt|It seems to have been an own goal.
p361_148.txt|Or someone wants to say something different.
p361_149.txt|There are no second chances.
p361_150.txt|And it was great for me.
p361_151.txt|I am extremely sad.
p361_152.txt|This series is for real.
p361_153.txt|It has still to be recovered.
p361_154.txt|The conclusion is the same.
p361_155.txt|I wish they would commit to us.
p361_156.txt|The driver just insulted me.
p361_157.txt|Something has to be put in place.
p361_158.txt|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p361_159.txt|It's a mixture of everything.
p361_160.txt|That is the sensible outcome.
p361_161.txt|You can see the appeal of running away.
p361_162.txt|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_163.txt|That comes at a cost.
p361_164.txt|And so did the rest of her team.
p361_165.txt|He tells the truth and that's important.
p361_166.txt|Those are difficult decisions.
p361_167.txt|The omens are not good.
p361_168.txt|The game was there to be won.
p361_169.txt|Then there's the casting.
p361_170.txt|There is no signature.
p361_171.txt|We can't go on like this.
p361_172.txt|It is a very demanding course.
p361_173.txt|Can he do it?
p361_174.txt|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p361_175.txt|I've won the British.
p361_176.txt|If they wish to go, they can go.
p361_177.txt|However, it was a different story in the final.
p361_178.txt|I was just aghast.
p361_179.txt|They get money for it now.
p361_180.txt|I could have been offended.
p361_181.txt|That's not the way to think.
p361_182.txt|I can see it now.
p361_183.txt|Then everyone must consider their future.
p361_184.txt|There was nothing she could do.
p361_185.txt|We want to be part of it.
p361_186.txt|It was a bit of a shock.
p361_187.txt|It's not long enough.
p361_188.txt|This is positive and welcome.
p361_189.txt|Now he is back on top again.
p361_190.txt|Actors like to be in the centre.
p361_191.txt|Anything less will not do.
p361_192.txt|Failure is not an option.
p361_193.txt|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_194.txt|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_195.txt|You look at that.
p361_196.txt|They will be very physical.
p361_197.txt|It has been well worth it.
p361_198.txt|It was just a feeling.
p361_199.txt|People are trying to run away.
p361_200.txt|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
p361_201.txt|This is clearly not abuse.
p361_202.txt|He should be careful.
p361_203.txt|Everyone knew the family.
p361_204.txt|I am prepared to step down.
p361_205.txt|Translation - we got it wrong.
p361_206.txt|We will be working on that this week, all right.
p361_207.txt|These are serious matters.
p361_208.txt|The pace is telling.
p361_209.txt|She has always been very friendly.
p361_210.txt|Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_211.txt|It is his script.
p361_212.txt|I am a socialist.
p361_213.txt|The response was really good.
p361_214.txt|The squad is too small.
p361_215.txt|You can blame the defence.
p361_216.txt|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_217.txt|It just could be a good night.
p361_218.txt|But we were wrong.
p361_219.txt|This has gone on too long.
p361_220.txt|It is an outrage.
p361_221.txt|It is a performance.
p361_222.txt|It is the best place.
p361_223.txt|We tried to get them down.
p361_224.txt|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361_225.txt|I don't know the full story.
p361_226.txt|Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361_227.txt|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p361_228.txt|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361_229.txt|I just want him to win a tournament.
p361_230.txt|Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_231.txt|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p361_232.txt|I will never see my son again.
p361_233.txt|But it is being pursued.
p361_234.txt|He knew they were there.
p361_235.txt|That would end it for us.
p361_236.txt|We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_237.txt|It attracted no complaints.
p361_238.txt|Neil is never going to come back.
p361_239.txt|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361_240.txt|Four of the victims were women.
p361_241.txt|He was also very happy to listen.
p361_242.txt|It's to do with this place.
p361_243.txt|It's a technical demand.
p361_244.txt|Sadly it is a mess.
p361_245.txt|That has to take its toll.
p361_246.txt|We want to see the maximum of change.
p361_247.txt|But those days are dead and gone.
p361_248.txt|However we must not be complacent.
p361_249.txt|And that was just the start.
p361_250.txt|Nothing was meant by it.
p361_251.txt|That was my last game.
p361_252.txt|Colour is another problem.
p361_253.txt|It is not just the agencies.
p361_254.txt|It came in bits and pieces.
p361_255.txt|You don't see that.
p361_256.txt|They seem to be, anyway.
p361_257.txt|I thought they were just excited.
p361_258.txt|He will appear in court today.
p361_259.txt|Or is he?
p361_260.txt|Was he confident about his prospects?
p361_261.txt|What can you do?
p361_262.txt|It's been very difficult.
p361_263.txt|Do something that we need.
p361_264.txt|There is no other offer on the table.
p361_265.txt|When she returned, it was a wreck.
p361_266.txt|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_267.txt|It is difficult to say.
p361_268.txt|He is not the only one.
p361_269.txt|We call it marriage.
p361_270.txt|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361_271.txt|It's not the tour.
p361_272.txt|So what is the secret of the success?
p361_273.txt|My husband was fighting for his life.
p361_274.txt|So was the first half.
p361_275.txt|It is still under discussion with the board.
p361_276.txt|That is one point of view.
p361_277.txt|We are in this for the long haul.
p361_278.txt|Here we go then.
p361_279.txt|No reason was given.
p361_280.txt|I can't wait for it to come out.
p361_281.txt|I am really sorry that he is going.
p361_282.txt|Indeed, that has already begun.
p361_283.txt|But it's the truth.
p361_284.txt|We have been here before.
p361_285.txt|And he did that.
p361_286.txt|And she is very clear on this.
p361_287.txt|His remarks were disgraceful.
p361_288.txt|I did not think it was very proper.
p361_289.txt|I have really noticed that this week.
p361_290.txt|In a way he was.
p361_291.txt|I will never forget that.
p361_292.txt|It was considered to be topical.
p361_293.txt|Well, that's all right then.
p361_294.txt|No-one is a winner in this.
p361_295.txt|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p361_296.txt|What do you think?
p361_297.txt|They went back to the seventeenth.
p361_298.txt|If we don't do it, someone else will.
p361_299.txt|Again, there was no detail.
p361_300.txt|Let the voters decide.
p361_301.txt|Then it will come.
p361_302.txt|It should be easy.
p361_303.txt|Is it worth it?
p361_304.txt|I will build a house on the site.
p361_305.txt|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p361_306.txt|I do my job.
p361_307.txt|They have to get that sorted.
p361_308.txt|That is a dangerous assumption.
p361_309.txt|Does it make a profit?
p361_310.txt|I think it's a good sign.
p361_311.txt|A winter of discontent awaits.
p361_312.txt|I knew him well.
p361_313.txt|I am not ready to walk away.
p361_314.txt|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_315.txt|They are already there.
p361_316.txt|I'd never given up on myself.
p361_317.txt|The concerns were unfounded.
p361_318.txt|It doesn't look good for her.
p361_319.txt|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p361_320.txt|I have some comments.
p361_321.txt|You have to be realistic.
p361_322.txt|There was nowhere for him to go.
p361_323.txt|Not that he was complaining.
p361_324.txt|We are very proud of him.
p361_325.txt|There they were, making excuses for him.
p361_326.txt|It just got out of control.
p361_327.txt|Every case is completely different.
p361_328.txt|It's all about unfinished business.
p361_329.txt|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361_330.txt|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
p361_331.txt|It will be fine.
p361_332.txt|Yet the job is far from over.
p361_333.txt|He has a point.
p361_334.txt|He should emerge as the winner.
p361_335.txt|It is our other home.
p361_336.txt|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
p361_337.txt|What a difference a game can make.
p361_338.txt|It is their day.
p361_339.txt|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
p361_340.txt|They are used to it.
p361_341.txt|And we are doing it.
p361_342.txt|It's just not good enough.
p361_343.txt|I have a cold.
p361_344.txt|You've got to hand it to them.
p361_345.txt|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
p361_346.txt|It was his own decision.
p361_347.txt|This is still happening in the US.
p361_348.txt|And that was the real problem.
p361_349.txt|But then the problems began.
p361_350.txt|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p361_351.txt|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361_352.txt|The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_353.txt|That there would be discussions.
p361_354.txt|It must not happen.
p361_355.txt|That would be unsafe.
p361_356.txt|I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_357.txt|We had no idea what was going on.
p361_358.txt|If only it had been.
p361_359.txt|So far, it is no more.
p361_360.txt|Seven people were critically injured.
p361_361.txt|I am very sorry to be here.
p361_362.txt|He could have given them a lot.
p361_363.txt|It was up to him.
p361_364.txt|It's going to happen.
p361_365.txt|I don't think so.
p361_366.txt|And that was just about that.
p361_367.txt|By hard work, is the answer.
p361_368.txt|It is really special to me.
p361_369.txt|This is a major step forward.
p361_370.txt|They haven't got the uniform.
p361_371.txt|Well, you don't have time.
p361_372.txt|It is very funny.
p361_373.txt|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_374.txt|This is good news for the industry.
p361_375.txt|There are no quick fixes.
p361_376.txt|Because they didn't want to know.
p361_377.txt|What do we have to do?
p361_378.txt|I have never seen anything like it.
p361_379.txt|It's about New Yorkers.
p361_380.txt|That was a real challenge.
p361_381.txt|They will give it a couple of years.
p361_382.txt|He certainly would have approved.
p361_383.txt|Conditions were less than ideal.
p361_384.txt|We want this place to work.
p361_385.txt|Father is on the train.
p361_386.txt|It could have been prevented.
p361_387.txt|We have been going for three years.
p361_388.txt|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
p361_389.txt|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p361_390.txt|It is planned for London in the spring.
p361_391.txt|Everything is coming together well.
p361_392.txt|They would have to go to the Royal.
p361_393.txt|But we are not afraid of them.
p361_394.txt|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p361_395.txt|That will be the criteria for the future.
p361_396.txt|They thought they couldn't get any.
p361_397.txt|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p361_398.txt|I am delighted to have her back home.
p361_399.txt|This idea is a good starting point.
p361_400.txt|She had denied the charge.
p361_401.txt|It was cynical and callous.
p361_402.txt|It's a dead end.
p361_403.txt|What sort of man is that?
p361_404.txt|The message was clear.
p361_405.txt|We are going nowhere.
p361_406.txt|It is truly masterly performance.
p361_407.txt|She failed to win any of them.
p361_408.txt|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p361_409.txt|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p361_410.txt|It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_411.txt|I found that we couldn't.
p361_412.txt|He is very sensitive.
p361_413.txt|That can benefit the larger companies.
p361_414.txt|I am still waiting for a reply.
p361_415.txt|We told them in July.
p361_416.txt|This was a very tragic accident.
p361_417.txt|We are very, very confident.
p361_418.txt|It is a result we should savour.
p361_419.txt|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361_420.txt|We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_421.txt|My life is going to go on.
p361_422.txt|It's really part of our mission.
p361_423.txt|That was only the start.
p361_424.txt|But what took them so long?
p362_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p362_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p362_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p362_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p362_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p362_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p362_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p362_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p362_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p362_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p362_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p362_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p362_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p362_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p362_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p362_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p362_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p362_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p362_025.txt|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p362_026.txt|This is your country.
p362_027.txt|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362_028.txt|I feel really good.
p362_029.txt|It was a fairy tale.
p362_030.txt|But there are no plans.
p362_031.txt|They responded in the most positive way.
p362_032.txt|I have a very strong opinion about this.
p362_033.txt|The British government said she was coming home.
p362_034.txt|We are a peaceful people.
p362_035.txt|His mother was English.
p362_036.txt|He was jailed for five years.
p362_037.txt|It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362_038.txt|Was this a new event?
p362_039.txt|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p362_040.txt|They had a confession.
p362_041.txt|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p362_042.txt|The chances were plentiful.
p362_043.txt|They were impressive against France.
p362_044.txt|This is only one example.
p362_045.txt|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p362_046.txt|The cause is just.
p362_047.txt|I am so upset.
p362_048.txt|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p362_049.txt|They finished second and third.
p362_050.txt|But this was refused.
p362_051.txt|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p362_052.txt|Hasn't let anyone down?
p362_053.txt|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p362_054.txt|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_055.txt|He is one of them.
p362_056.txt|This was no accident.
p362_057.txt|He is a law unto himself.
p362_058.txt|It is a sign of hope.
p362_059.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p362_060.txt|They're interested only in profits.
p362_061.txt|And there has been a good start.
p362_062.txt|I feel my parents are in New York.
p362_063.txt|Policing the profession is important.
p362_064.txt|Seems a sensible compromise.
p362_065.txt|She had no chance.
p362_066.txt|In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
p362_067.txt|I don't have a problem with it.
p362_068.txt|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362_069.txt|It's more relaxing this way.
p362_070.txt|Allison is not convinced.
p362_071.txt|We have to move forward from now on.
p362_072.txt|And it was this one.
p362_073.txt|I am going to win the next two.
p362_074.txt|She's afraid of life.
p362_075.txt|But there is good and bad.
p362_076.txt|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p362_077.txt|That is her job.
p362_078.txt|They have broken that promise.
p362_079.txt|I don't know what it means.
p362_080.txt|I found the course inspiring.
p362_081.txt|I have to accept that.
p362_082.txt|It means the margin for error is tight.
p362_083.txt|I thought he was part of the camera.
p362_084.txt|She is now on the back benches.
p362_085.txt|It is not a road of life.
p362_086.txt|Three bystanders were killed.
p362_087.txt|One is investment, one is reform.
p362_088.txt|They could not have done more for me.
p362_089.txt|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p362_090.txt|It benefits the whole family.
p362_091.txt|It's not my fault.
p362_092.txt|My husband was angry.
p362_093.txt|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p362_094.txt|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p362_095.txt|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p362_096.txt|They have to work so hard.
p362_097.txt|Well, was it?
p362_098.txt|I thought he was my friend.
p362_099.txt|What kind of person is he?
p362_100.txt|There's a strong involvement.
p362_101.txt|This is complete nonsense.
p362_102.txt|This Government is cutting taxes.
p362_103.txt|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362_104.txt|They know their son was murdered.
p362_105.txt|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p362_106.txt|So is that it, then?
p362_107.txt|The task is enormous.
p362_108.txt|I know he meant it.
p362_109.txt|A, The media has been great.
p362_110.txt|There have been so many.
p362_111.txt|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p362_112.txt|Of course, it is nonsense.
p362_113.txt|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p362_114.txt|He had returned to die.
p362_115.txt|Anyone can take a photo.
p362_116.txt|He is involved in everything.
p362_117.txt|No person was charged.
p362_118.txt|You see, my back has gone.
p362_119.txt|He's a nice guy.
p362_120.txt|The fire was still coming down.
p362_121.txt|It's always the way.
p362_122.txt|I got the surprise of my life.
p362_123.txt|It will be tight.
p362_124.txt|He seems to be used to the attention.
p362_125.txt|Both are national treasures.
p362_126.txt|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p362_127.txt|Well, you don't have time.
p362_128.txt|I had never done anything like it before.
p362_129.txt|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p362_130.txt|But he thought the overall results were good.
p362_131.txt|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p362_132.txt|I had been hoping for justice.
p362_133.txt|Labour is providing none of these.
p362_134.txt|The building was starting to come down.
p362_135.txt|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p362_136.txt|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p362_137.txt|There is a subtle difference.
p362_138.txt|He has created the confusion.
p362_139.txt|He didn't get out much.
p362_140.txt|She was very different.
p362_141.txt|That is my dream.
p362_142.txt|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p362_143.txt|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
p362_144.txt|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p362_145.txt|The choice is simple.
p362_146.txt|Who is going to pay their wages?
p362_147.txt|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_148.txt|It was that kind of match.
p362_149.txt|We couldn't believe it at first.
p362_150.txt|Feel the air, the space.
p362_151.txt|I have nothing to regret.
p362_152.txt|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p362_153.txt|A century on, little has changed.
p362_154.txt|Wrong decisions Address in full
p362_155.txt|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p362_156.txt|He is having a nightmare.
p362_157.txt|And he still is.
p362_158.txt|However, the story has a happy ending.
p362_159.txt|You never had it so good.
p362_160.txt|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p362_161.txt|Then he did it twice.
p362_162.txt|So is the rest of British sport.
p362_163.txt|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p362_164.txt|It was his greatest movie performance.
p362_165.txt|We go back a long way.
p362_166.txt|So, easy does it.
p362_167.txt|Not that he's declined.
p362_168.txt|People also have trouble with the currency.
p362_169.txt|I always wanted her to be happy.
p362_170.txt|We've got to get back to normal.
p362_171.txt|Do we want to see it?
p362_172.txt|That is for certain.
p362_173.txt|An inquiry has begun.
p362_174.txt|I was a little surprised.
p362_175.txt|That is not, however, the case.
p362_176.txt|Only two players have done it.
p362_177.txt|He is a master of deceit and delay.
p362_178.txt|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p362_179.txt|What was that all about?
p362_180.txt|This is a fine appointment.
p362_181.txt|That was the finest moment in my career.
p362_182.txt|England will be quite prepared.
p362_183.txt|He is appealing to women.
p362_184.txt|There is no conflict of interest.
p362_185.txt|She has the biggest part.
p362_186.txt|Film music was never the same again.
p362_187.txt|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p362_188.txt|I thought he was at fault.
p362_189.txt|The First Minister is an addict.
p362_190.txt|We will win this tie.
p362_191.txt|I think he's done it a few times.
p362_192.txt|Something happened on that island.
p362_193.txt|This is a business.
p362_194.txt|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p362_195.txt|I never had any real direction at school.
p362_196.txt|That's how it works.
p362_197.txt|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
p362_198.txt|Do what you want to do.
p362_199.txt|We know the quality of life goes up.
p362_200.txt|Who are the public?
p362_201.txt|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p362_203.txt|But we have learned that it doesn't.
p362_204.txt|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p362_205.txt|They should not be blamed for it.
p362_206.txt|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p362_207.txt|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
p362_208.txt|It was crucial strike.
p362_209.txt|I have no secrets.
p362_210.txt|What do you want to say?
p362_211.txt|I was so relieved.
p362_212.txt|They continue to do so.
p362_213.txt|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362_214.txt|It is a worry.
p362_215.txt|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p362_216.txt|That is highly unfair.
p362_217.txt|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p362_218.txt|Gas is too expensive.
p362_219.txt|This plan is an agenda for action.
p362_220.txt|It was all relative.
p362_221.txt|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p362_222.txt|Are you up for business?
p362_223.txt|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p362_224.txt|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_225.txt|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p362_226.txt|Life becomes a song.
p362_227.txt|No wonder he missed the conversion.
p362_228.txt|Sadly, they did not.
p362_229.txt|We have nowhere to go.
p362_230.txt|He has every right to do that.
p362_231.txt|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p362_232.txt|That had never happened.
p362_233.txt|However, our players will fight for that.
p362_234.txt|They are not suitable.
p362_235.txt|He is advised that he has done so.
p362_236.txt|You mean he didn't get the girl?
p362_237.txt|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p362_238.txt|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p362_239.txt|But the killing will continue.
p362_240.txt|They've got to get better.
p362_241.txt|But we are working together for this result.
p362_242.txt|Mental health is a massive issue.
p362_243.txt|It doesn't make them evil.
p362_244.txt|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p362_245.txt|The most important thing is the game.
p362_246.txt|He said nothing of the sort.
p362_247.txt|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p362_248.txt|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
p362_249.txt|The door is open.
p362_250.txt|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p362_251.txt|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p362_252.txt|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p362_253.txt|So what went wrong?
p362_254.txt|We did not play well.
p362_255.txt|We are in a very strong position.
p362_256.txt|This will have no effect on the championship.
p362_257.txt|That is the key.
p362_258.txt|So, how did you do?
p362_259.txt|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p362_260.txt|It was, however, the wrong side.
p362_261.txt|I can't deny that fact.
p362_262.txt|She is now planning a visit.
p362_263.txt|We could have done without this.
p362_264.txt|Boy is the town a mess.
p362_265.txt|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p362_266.txt|He's a great dealer.
p362_267.txt|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p362_268.txt|I want to concentrate on the real issues.
p362_269.txt|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p362_270.txt|We are moving on.
p362_271.txt|This is not a crisis.
p362_272.txt|There's always a chance.
p362_273.txt|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p362_274.txt|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p362_275.txt|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p362_276.txt|That's a very serious matter.
p362_277.txt|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p362_278.txt|But it was to no avail.
p362_279.txt|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
p362_280.txt|It has been a major success.
p362_281.txt|It takes a bit of working out.
p362_282.txt|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p362_283.txt|But it didn't bother me.
p362_284.txt|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p362_285.txt|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
p362_286.txt|He will not be coming back.
p362_287.txt|He is also a great finisher.
p362_288.txt|I don't see any problem.
p362_289.txt|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p362_290.txt|Yet it seemed to work.
p362_291.txt|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_292.txt|I have never felt so well.
p362_293.txt|There are other things going on.
p362_294.txt|All is now forgiven.
p362_295.txt|So who is right?
p362_296.txt|And this tournament will travel.
p362_297.txt|There will be new memories.
p362_298.txt|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p362_299.txt|We know the goals will come.
p362_300.txt|How can they get one?
p362_301.txt|It was an insult.
p362_302.txt|But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_303.txt|We have nothing to hide.
p362_304.txt|He added, We are full of anger.
p362_305.txt|He did it all for us.
p362_306.txt|I don't think that is good enough.
p362_307.txt|Of course it is.
p362_308.txt|We all make mistakes.
p362_309.txt|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p362_310.txt|That is my commitment.
p362_311.txt|This is the only problem with the story.
p362_312.txt|It is good football in Scotland.
p362_313.txt|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p362_314.txt|Is that right?
p362_315.txt|So other options had to be explored.
p362_316.txt|They should be so lucky.
p362_317.txt|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362_318.txt|It is good news for us.
p362_319.txt|The timing is obvious.
p362_320.txt|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p362_321.txt|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p362_322.txt|I don't think it's very real.
p362_323.txt|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362_324.txt|I think she was right.
p362_325.txt|Is that what people want?
p362_326.txt|CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
p362_327.txt|I'd like to continue that record.
p362_328.txt|It will be a new experience.
p362_329.txt|The process itself has taken over.
p362_330.txt|She asked for the appointment with me.
p362_331.txt|The time commitment is the biggest thing.
p362_332.txt|It is quite hard to track.
p362_333.txt|It's not going to last five minutes.
p362_334.txt|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p362_335.txt|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p362_336.txt|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p362_337.txt|It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_338.txt|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p362_339.txt|Doesn't matter what you do.
p362_340.txt|O no it's not!
p362_341.txt|The result could be all down to turnout.
p362_342.txt|They are in good spirits.
p362_343.txt|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p362_344.txt|He was their leader.
p362_345.txt|The support of Britain is assumed.
p362_346.txt|So far he has not done so.
p362_347.txt|Maybe they will show it next year.
p362_348.txt|They are a very good team.
p362_349.txt|So there we are.
p362_350.txt|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p362_351.txt|It doesn't make me feel any better.
p362_352.txt|The conversion didn't go over either.
p362_353.txt|The incident is dead.
p362_354.txt|We are delighted with the result.
p362_355.txt|It will take time.
p362_356.txt|They will do something big.
p362_357.txt|The programme was awful.
p362_358.txt|It is having a big impact.
p362_359.txt|That is very hard, alone.
p362_360.txt|I am feeling on top of the world.
p362_361.txt|Doesn't he miss it?
p362_362.txt|The same goes for Russia.
p362_363.txt|They went down together.
p362_364.txt|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p362_365.txt|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p362_366.txt|We were getting very worried.
p362_367.txt|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p362_368.txt|You can't really compare.
p362_369.txt|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p362_370.txt|Plot is not the issue.
p362_371.txt|We need to increase the membership.
p362_372.txt|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p362_373.txt|We should not be complacent.
p362_374.txt|We all want the same things.
p362_375.txt|Maybe his time has gone.
p362_376.txt|She died in hospital two hours later.
p362_377.txt|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p362_378.txt|SO, that is it for another year.
p362_379.txt|The results are tragic.
p362_380.txt|We are not getting him back.
p362_381.txt|He was on a horse.
p362_382.txt|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p362_383.txt|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p362_384.txt|There may be reasons for it.
p362_385.txt|He had taken everything from me.
p362_386.txt|It's a good offer by any standards.
p362_387.txt|Yes, it took time to recover.
p362_388.txt|The potential is always in the idea.
p362_389.txt|I am not a frustrated actor.
p362_390.txt|No progress has been made.
p362_391.txt|He can win every week.
p362_392.txt|This makes up for it.
p362_393.txt|My mind was made up.
p362_394.txt|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p362_395.txt|I never got anything out of it.
p362_396.txt|It is patently true.
p362_397.txt|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362_398.txt|But don't just take my word, for it.
p362_399.txt|That is why he is so special.
p362_400.txt|You hope he prevails.
p362_401.txt|My mother was getting on at me.
p362_402.txt|This is a very serious matter.
p362_403.txt|It's going to be great!
p362_404.txt|That's a good sign.
p362_405.txt|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p362_406.txt|He added that he felt undermined.
p362_407.txt|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p362_408.txt|He declined to be more specific.
p362_409.txt|But it looks good for next year.
p362_410.txt|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362_411.txt|We want everyone to have a good time.
p362_412.txt|We're going to rebuild.
p362_413.txt|We are trying to do it properly.
p362_414.txt|We actually had a laugh about that.
p362_415.txt|It raises the edge.
p362_416.txt|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p362_417.txt|I had no idea.
p362_418.txt|As indeed it did.
p362_419.txt|We made a world record together.
p362_420.txt|They were outside the circle.
p362_421.txt|I want to help other women.
p362_422.txt|He got the part.
p362_423.txt|Or, rather, it isn't.
p362_424.txt|He refused to name the survivors.
p363_001.txt|Please call Stella.
p363_002.txt|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363_003.txt|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p363_004.txt|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363_005.txt|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p363_006.txt|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p363_007.txt|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363_008.txt|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p363_009.txt|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p363_010.txt|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p363_011.txt|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363_012.txt|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363_013.txt|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363_014.txt|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363_015.txt|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363_016.txt|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363_017.txt|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363_018.txt|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363_019.txt|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p363_020.txt|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363_021.txt|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p363_022.txt|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p363_023.txt|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p363_024.txt|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p363_025.txt|It's never been to committee.
p363_026.txt|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363_027.txt|It was actually very, very difficult.
p363_028.txt|The proposals were not new.
p363_029.txt|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_030.txt|His party never arrived.
p363_031.txt|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_032.txt|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p363_033.txt|He gave no other details.
p363_034.txt|It's not an improvement for him.
p363_035.txt|I think it is wide open.
p363_036.txt|It certainly is cause for concern.
p363_037.txt|It's on with a roller.
p363_038.txt|The captaincy will help that, too.
p363_039.txt|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_040.txt|I think we're a long way forward.
p363_041.txt|The impact was immediate.
p363_042.txt|There is a new confidence about the club.
p363_043.txt|His film is not.
p363_044.txt|It is the strength of the school.
p363_045.txt|In my experience, he does not do that.
p363_046.txt|That is good news.
p363_047.txt|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_048.txt|He will never be forgotten.
p363_049.txt|I was not overly concerned about this.
p363_050.txt|He was very grateful for his health.
p363_051.txt|The nation has his music.
p363_052.txt|But real life is not like that.
p363_053.txt|So now we know.
p363_054.txt|That is why this action has been taken.
p363_055.txt|Who will pay for this?
p363_056.txt|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_057.txt|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_058.txt|We were upset about the referee.
p363_059.txt|That is our objective.
p363_060.txt|What's the problem?
p363_061.txt|He is not alone.
p363_062.txt|He did that last Sunday.
p363_063.txt|There wasn't anything in it.
p363_064.txt|The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_065.txt|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_066.txt|Lovely day isn't it?
p363_067.txt|It was far from business as usual.
p363_068.txt|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_069.txt|The show is not over.
p363_070.txt|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p363_071.txt|This is a judgment issue.
p363_072.txt|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p363_073.txt|It was just an accident.
p363_074.txt|We are not commenting at the moment.
p363_075.txt|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_076.txt|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_077.txt|He is slightly confused.
p363_078.txt|We did not deserve to go through.
p363_079.txt|The course has helped a lot.
p363_080.txt|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
p363_081.txt|There is room for me.
p363_082.txt|That can only be a good thing.
p363_083.txt|I have never seen anything like this.
p363_084.txt|They are difficult awards to decide.
p363_085.txt|It was that kind of war.
p363_086.txt|That is my preference.
p363_087.txt|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p363_088.txt|It has come a long way since then.
p363_089.txt|It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_090.txt|But someone has got to do it.
p363_091.txt|We have not given up.
p363_092.txt|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_093.txt|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363_094.txt|What has happened?
p363_095.txt|If they are not, the commission will take action.
p363_096.txt|Where will the money come from?
p363_097.txt|She is still very poorly.
p363_098.txt|It was good fun.
p363_099.txt|This is a great shame.
p363_100.txt|We talk about effective military action.
p363_101.txt|I can't get it.
p363_102.txt|It was entirely justified.
p363_103.txt|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p363_104.txt|It's somewhere in between.
p363_105.txt|The play was to go straight ahead.
p363_106.txt|He had never run the distance before.
p363_107.txt|I am the head.
p363_108.txt|He is obviously very dangerous.
p363_109.txt|It can be very worrying.
p363_110.txt|It's harder, believe me.
p363_111.txt|We are making no comment.
p363_112.txt|I sit at home a lot.
p363_113.txt|That was certainly the case for the parties.
p363_114.txt|I hope the couples are still together.
p363_115.txt|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p363_116.txt|But that is not enough.
p363_117.txt|These people are helpless.
p363_118.txt|I wish him well.
p363_119.txt|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p363_120.txt|It would be really interesting if they did.
p363_121.txt|That takes a lot of courage.
p363_122.txt|Sadly, it is not to be.
p363_123.txt|Motorists will welcome this.
p363_124.txt|I welcome this Bill.
p363_125.txt|This is not a problem.
p363_126.txt|he announced his plans.
p363_127.txt|He is the man to beat.
p363_128.txt|We are getting not a penny.
p363_129.txt|Look at the turn-out.
p363_130.txt|Which brings us to the question of money.
p363_131.txt|It is very simple.
p363_132.txt|There was something special about that.
p363_133.txt|Many other areas are coming up.
p363_134.txt|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p363_135.txt|There were no reports of casualties.
p363_136.txt|But it's a subtle process.
p363_137.txt|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363_138.txt|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p363_139.txt|Changes need to be made.
p363_140.txt|Things are going well.
p363_141.txt|Hard it will be.
p363_142.txt|I was deeply worried.
p363_143.txt|Maybe it will work there.
p363_144.txt|How does it all work?
p363_145.txt|We could easily have lost that game.
p363_146.txt|There's a lot of it going on.
p363_147.txt|I doubt it would be genuine.
p363_148.txt|It would be a masterclass.
p363_149.txt|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p363_150.txt|I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_151.txt|They will not be going back.
p363_152.txt|The progress has been steady.
p363_153.txt|It has no chance.
p363_154.txt|His body was never found.
p363_155.txt|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p363_156.txt|We have been extremely busy.
p363_157.txt|It appears to have been successful.
p363_158.txt|This is a big game for them.
p363_159.txt|We still have to wait for that.
p363_160.txt|He said it was his greatest work.
p363_161.txt|I feel a little betrayed.
p363_162.txt|The baby deserves the credit.
p363_163.txt|I live for today.
p363_164.txt|I have been very stupid.
p363_165.txt|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p363_166.txt|My father and mother are.
p363_167.txt|But that was his nature.
p363_168.txt|We have been together for five years.
p363_169.txt|They would never let him go.
p363_170.txt|So what's in store?
p363_171.txt|He didn't know where to look.
p363_172.txt|The German had a point to make.
p363_173.txt|There are two characters.
p363_174.txt|The only trouble is finding them.
p363_175.txt|Scotland won by six wickets.
p363_176.txt|Her body has never been found.
p363_177.txt|It is all credit to them today.
p363_178.txt|That was a huge experience.
p363_179.txt|Perhaps it was just as well.
p363_180.txt|Will he be here for the weekend?
p363_181.txt|He can do everything.
p363_182.txt|Now is the time for action.
p363_183.txt|Public safety is paramount.
p363_184.txt|I feel really confident in that department.
p363_185.txt|They were not consulted.
p363_186.txt|He had an apartment ready.
p363_187.txt|The prime minister will make the decision.
p363_188.txt|THERE's only one word for it.
p363_189.txt|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p363_190.txt|It was far more important than that.
p363_191.txt|That is European law.
p363_192.txt|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_193.txt|Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_194.txt|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363_195.txt|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363_196.txt|A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_197.txt|I wanted to get on with it.
p363_198.txt|I don't think it's the area.
p363_199.txt|Well, you might have a point.
p363_200.txt|It was a horrible moment.
p363_201.txt|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p363_202.txt|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363_203.txt|I really had to concentrate.
p363_204.txt|We didn't want any trouble.
p363_205.txt|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p363_206.txt|The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363_207.txt|We have still got the fight in us.
p363_208.txt|That decision is now being appealed.
p363_209.txt|This is really good news for us.
p363_210.txt|I wanted to have a go.
p363_211.txt|A senior party insider said.
p363_212.txt|We got on very well.
p363_213.txt|I think it must be the uniforms.
p363_214.txt|This is not a monument to the past.
p363_215.txt|We can all understand that.
p363_216.txt|You are going to have to do it.
p363_217.txt|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_218.txt|Where is the evidence?
p363_219.txt|It was important in training terms.
p363_220.txt|Ours is on for two days.
p363_221.txt|We don't want that at all.
p363_222.txt|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363_223.txt|The group will report back in the summer.
p363_224.txt|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p363_225.txt|We don't come here for our health.
p363_226.txt|That in itself is a joke.
p363_227.txt|They know nothing about the sport.
p363_228.txt|But we shall have to talk to him.
p363_229.txt|Well, we know now.
p363_230.txt|He was only doing his job.
p363_231.txt|They chose the latter.
p363_232.txt|The legal process could last weeks.
p363_233.txt|All were later allowed home.
p363_234.txt|I can do this on my own.
p363_235.txt|Will you just put it away?
p363_236.txt|I think it's more important to have fun.
p363_237.txt|By then it was too late.
p363_238.txt|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_239.txt|I'm so looking forward to it.
p363_240.txt|I think we can do well.
p363_241.txt|That ignorance is crucial.
p363_242.txt|It was an excellent performance.
p363_243.txt|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363_244.txt|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
p363_245.txt|I have not had much of him.
p363_246.txt|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p363_247.txt|We are taking no chances this time.
p363_248.txt|He is to be commended.
p363_249.txt|I can hardly believe it.
p363_250.txt|The goals will come.
p363_251.txt|I don't feel like working.
p363_252.txt|Then one day it happened.
p363_253.txt|I sit in the car.
p363_254.txt|We stopped at half-time.
p363_255.txt|I was brought up in a mining background.
p363_256.txt|All winners should be tested.
p363_257.txt|We would like to see them in court.
p363_258.txt|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363_259.txt|It is not a soap opera.
p363_260.txt|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
p363_261.txt|They may not always be so lucky.
p363_262.txt|Where was the point in all this?
p363_263.txt|He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_264.txt|It's an hour of the same response.
p363_265.txt|This is the root of their problems.
p363_266.txt|Two other men have recovered.
p363_267.txt|It will be a challenging film.
p363_268.txt|The test case is still awaiting action.
p363_269.txt|She is under police escort.
p363_270.txt|However, that is not in itself enough.
p363_271.txt|That should not be their conclusion.
p363_272.txt|We're going to fight it.
p363_273.txt|The plot is minimal.
p363_274.txt|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p363_275.txt|Now we have had enough.
p363_276.txt|Can you believe it?
p363_277.txt|He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_278.txt|I have a problem with these things.
p363_280.txt|The gap is closing.
p363_281.txt|Then there was her childhood.
p363_282.txt|Other people had looked at it.
p363_283.txt|And the other winners are.
p363_284.txt|It was quite a sight.
p363_285.txt|But he was far from alone.
p363_286.txt|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p363_287.txt|I believe he could have turned it around.
p363_288.txt|The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363_289.txt|You are looking at him.
p363_290.txt|The best team won.
p363_291.txt|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
p363_292.txt|It was an achievement all right.
p363_293.txt|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363_294.txt|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363_295.txt|It should be equal.
p363_296.txt|It will make a big difference.
p363_297.txt|I want to make a difference.
p363_298.txt|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_299.txt|He will have it within two weeks.
p363_300.txt|How do you feel?
p363_301.txt|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p363_302.txt|It was not the right time for me.
p363_303.txt|But they have the sound.
p363_304.txt|Not all women are dismayed.
p363_305.txt|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p363_306.txt|It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363_307.txt|It's never happened before.
p363_308.txt|It was a deeper deception.
p363_309.txt|Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_310.txt|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p363_311.txt|There is another side to it.
p363_312.txt|His remit is specific.
p363_313.txt|It will be very damaging for research.
p363_314.txt|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_315.txt|The Old Firm are growing.
p363_316.txt|They want to win the title.
p363_317.txt|Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_318.txt|This decision is a farce.
p363_319.txt|That would be the constructive way forward.
p363_320.txt|My view has now completely changed.
p363_321.txt|It was blown out of proportion.
p363_322.txt|You have no chance of planning permission.
p363_323.txt|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363_324.txt|He was in a mood.
p363_325.txt|Was this element always there?
p363_326.txt|This is an awful lot of money.
p363_327.txt|He was the architect.
p363_328.txt|The United Nations must act.
p363_329.txt|They haven't got a hope.
p363_330.txt|He was a national treasure.
p363_331.txt|I think they are right to be impatient.
p363_332.txt|We need to regroup.
p363_333.txt|I must make that clear.
p363_334.txt|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p363_335.txt|I've never regretted coming here.
p363_336.txt|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p363_337.txt|I just had to go for it.
p363_338.txt|It seems to go down well.
p363_339.txt|I am feeling on top of the world.
p363_341.txt|I don't know, really.
p363_343.txt|Therefore there is a threat.
p363_344.txt|She would love it.
p363_345.txt|One was taken to hospital.
p363_346.txt|You did not see it.
p363_347.txt|Gritty he did not want.
p363_348.txt|The world is being invited to visit.
p363_349.txt|Nobody was able to escape.
p363_350.txt|Surely the answer is yes.
p363_351.txt|Secondly, there is the question of money.
p363_352.txt|He was later deported.
p363_353.txt|I only found out about it this morning.
p363_354.txt|I am not sure.
p363_355.txt|One might think that it is a power.
p363_356.txt|This place is outstanding.
p363_357.txt|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363_358.txt|But it is a fact.
p363_359.txt|They never seem to do anything about it.
p363_360.txt|We're going to sleep.
p363_361.txt|It raises a serious question mark.
p363_362.txt|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p363_363.txt|It was great fun.
p363_364.txt|Experience in this work is paramount.
p363_365.txt|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363_366.txt|It is not needed, it should go.
p363_367.txt|She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_368.txt|We have a business to run.
p363_369.txt|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_370.txt|And there are others.
p363_371.txt|However, it was well worth the wait.
p363_372.txt|I think we did well.
p363_373.txt|Only two things are certain.
p363_374.txt|There is nothing to fear.
p363_375.txt|Just look at his record.
p363_376.txt|He was a legend.
p363_377.txt|It is a memorial.
p363_378.txt|I have no evidence.
p363_379.txt|But is he?
p363_380.txt|We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_381.txt|The challenge is to win a cup.
p363_382.txt|It is something that we would support.
p363_383.txt|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p363_384.txt|We are in shock.
p363_385.txt|Does it really matter?
p363_386.txt|I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363_387.txt|A decision is expected today.
p363_388.txt|I am enjoying it.
p363_389.txt|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_390.txt|You have to go for it.
p363_391.txt|Are these immoral?
p363_392.txt|It has been a massive success.
p363_393.txt|It is for the same reason.
p363_394.txt|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363_395.txt|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363_396.txt|He will have something to say.
p363_397.txt|You can't take a chance.
p363_398.txt|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363_399.txt|There is a lack of logic.
p363_401.txt|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p363_402.txt|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p363_403.txt|It is a large number.
p363_404.txt|She doesn't know where to begin.
p363_405.txt|This is your chance.
p363_406.txt|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_407.txt|There's nothing she can't do.
p363_408.txt|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p363_409.txt|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363_410.txt|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363_411.txt|He died in September.
p363_412.txt|It was not even this century.
p363_413.txt|That was really tough.
p363_414.txt|It's not going to last five minutes.
p363_415.txt|I am happy with my form.
p363_416.txt|That's the name of the game, though.
p363_417.txt|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p363_418.txt|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
p363_419.txt|This is actually true.
p363_420.txt|Both were reduced to rubble.
p363_421.txt|It could have taken another two months.
p363_422.txt|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p363_423.txt|He said he had no reports of casualties.
